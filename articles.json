        "content": "Weapons is a 2025 American mystery horror film directed, written, produced, and co-scored by Zach Cregger. The film stars Josh Brolin, Julia Garner, Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, Cary Christopher, Toby Huss, Benedict Wong and Amy Madigan. The film's plot follows the seemingly inexplicable case of seventeen children from the same classroom who mysteriously run away on the same night at the same time, having been apparently abducted by an unseen force.\nWeapons was released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on August 8, 2025. The film received critical acclaim and became a box office success, grossing $239.1 million worldwide on a $38 million budget.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nA child narrator explains that on a Wednesday two years previously, in the town of Maybrook, Pennsylvania, seventeen children from elementary school teacher Justine Gandy's third-grade class suddenly ran from their homes at 2:17 a.m. and disappeared. Only one student, Alex Lilly, remained.\nAlmost a month after the incident, Principal Marcus Miller places Justine on leave amid community suspicion of her involvement in the children's disappearance. Depressed and ostracized, she relapses into alcoholism and starts an affair with her married ex-boyfriend, police officer Paul Morgan. Concerned for Alex's well-being, Justine follows him home. After noticing Alex's windows are all covered with newspaper and spotting his parents sitting motionless in the dark, she urges Marcus to perform a wellness check. While performing a stakeout at Alex's house, Justine falls asleep in her car; Alex's mother enters the car and cuts a lock of Justine's hair.\nArcher Graff, father of missing child Matthew, begins his own investigation, frustrated with the police's minimal progress. After reviewing security camera footage of Matthew and another child, he notices that the children's running paths converge at a specific area but cannot determine their exact destination. Both Justine and Archer dream about the missing children and a mysterious woman with clown-like makeup.\nWhile on patrol, Paul arrests James, a vagrant drug addict, for attempted burglary, but is forced to release him after assaulting him in view of his car's camera. Later, while burglarizing Alex's house, James finds Alex's parents and the missing children in the basement in a catatonic state. He reports his findings to the police in hopes of earning the $50,000 reward, but Paul, fearing being reported, chases him out. James flees into the woods, hiding in his tent after spotting the clown-like woman. When caught by Paul, James insists he knows where the missing children are. Paul drives to Alex's house, leaving James handcuffed in the car while he investigates. Hours later, Paul reemerges and drags James inside.\nMarcus is visited at school by the woman, who introduces herself as Alex's aunt Gladys and explains that she has become the family's caretaker after Alex's parents fell ill. Marcus insists on meeting Alex's parents for a wellness check. Later, Gladys visits Marcus and his husband Terry at their home. She performs a ritual with a ribbon stolen from Marcus and locks of Terry and Justine's hair. She enchants Marcus, forcing him to kill Terry and pursue Justine. Marcus attacks Justine at a gas station, interrupting an argument between her and Archer, and is fatally hit by a car when he pursues her as she escapes. Archer later apologizes to Justine for his hostility toward her and shares his findings with her. Justine realizes that the children were all running toward Alex's house.\nIt is revealed that Gladys, a dying witch who can enchant victims and either drain their energy to rejuvenate herself or command them to kill for her, had actually enchanted Alex's parents, subsequently threatening their lives to persuade Alex to keep her secret. She then ordered him to bring home personal items from each of his classmates, which she used to draw the children to Alex's house so she could keep them in the basement to feed on their life force.\nJustine and Archer enter Alex's house, where they are attacked by the enchanted Paul and James before Justine takes Paul's gun and fatally shoots them both. Archer searches for Matthew in the basement, but Gladys enchants him and sends him to attack Justine. Meanwhile, Alex evades his bewitched parents and replicates Gladys's spell using a strand of hair from her wig. The children emerge from the basement, chase Gladys out of the house and around the neighborhood, and tear her apart. Her death frees her victims, though all but Archer remain in a catatonic state.\nAs Archer carries Matthew home, the narrator explains that Alex moved out of town to live with a different aunt after his parents were institutionalized. The children were all reunited with their parents, and some eventually began speaking again.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nJosh Brolin as Archer Graff, a construction contractor and the father of Matthew, one of the missing children.\nJulia Garner as Justine Gandy, an elementary school teacher who finds that all but one of the students in her class has vanished.\nAlden Ehrenreich as Paul Morgan, a corrupt police officer and Justine's ex-boyfriend.\nAustin Abrams as James, a homeless drug addict and burglar.\nCary Christopher as Alex Lilly, the only child from Justine's class who did not disappear.\nBenedict Wong as Marcus Miller, the school principal who is sympathetic to Justine.\nAmy Madigan as Gladys, Alex's eccentric and elderly aunt.\nToby Huss as Ed Locke, the police captain and Paul's father-in-law.\nSara Paxton as Erica, the mother of Bailey, one of the missing children.\nJustin Long as Gary, the father of Bailey, one of the missing children.\nJune Diane Raphael as Donna Morgan, Paul's wife and Ed's daughter.\nWhitmer Thomas as Mr. Lilly, Alex's father.\nCallie Schuttera as Mrs. Lilly, Alex's mother.\nClayton Farris as Terry Miller, Marcus' husband.\nLuke Speakman as Matthew Graff, Archer's son and one of Justine's missing students.\nScarlett Sher as the child narrator of the film.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nAfter the financial and critical success of his film Barbarian (2022), Zach Cregger began work on a new spec script titled Weapons. It has been described as a \"horror epic\" with a more \"personal story\" for the filmmaker, inspired by Paul Thomas Anderson's film Magnolia (1999), Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners (2013), and Jennifer Egan's novel A Visit from the Goon Squad. Cregger was inspired to write the screenplay after the death of his close friend and collaborator, Trevor Moore. The screenplay entered the market on January 22, 2023, and prompted a bidding war among Netflix, New Line Cinema, TriStar Pictures and Universal Pictures.\nAccording to Cregger, the script was given through the software app Embershot to the studios on January 23, 2023, at 8:00 a.m., and by 9:30 a.m., Michael De Luca, CEO of Warner Bros. Pictures, contacted him to close the deal. New Line secured the rights within 24 hours after offering $38 million to cover all costs, including production and salaries, with Cregger receiving $10 million as writer, director, and producer and final cut privilege (pending test screening reactions to the film) in addition to a guaranteed theatrical release. Universal offered $7 million less than Warner Brothers. Jordan Peele, whose company Monkeypaw Productions participated in the bidding war in conjunction with Universal, parted ways with longtime managers Joel Zadak and Peter Principato, the latter of whom was also Cregger's manager, after losing the auction.\nCregger's CAA agent, Joe Mann, negotiated a $10 million upfront fee, of which Cregger deferred $2 million in return for 50 backend points on the movie.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nBetween May and July 2023, Pedro Pascal, Renate Reinsve, Brian Tyree Henry, Austin Abrams, Tom Burke, and June Diane Raphael were cast in the film. However, as a result of production delays and the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, Pascal, Reinsve, Henry, and Burke had to drop out of the film due to scheduling conflicts, with Pascal in particular having to exit the film for running against his commitment with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025).\nIn February 2024, Josh Brolin joined the cast to replace Pascal. In April, Julia Garner (replacing Reinsve) and Alden Ehrenreich (replacing Burke) joined the cast. In May, Benedict Wong (replacing Henry), Amy Madigan and Cary Christopher were announced to have joined the cast.\nAccording to Cregger, Madigan \"saved\" the movie. When discussing the character, he stated that he gave her two options as to Gladys' origin: one where she was a regular person using witchcraft to prevent her dying from an incurable condition, and one where she was instead an immortal creature performing an approximate simulacrum of a human being, but that he did not ask her which one she chose.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography took place in Atlanta in May 2024. Filming wrapped in July 2024. The Maybrook Elementary School was set in Tucker, Georgia. According to Time Out, on the busiest days of filming, the production would be home to more than 170 children. Child labor coordinators were enlisted to keep the kids engaged when not filming. The gas station scenes were filmed over the course of three days at a BP gas station and convenience store in Covington, Georgia.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nThe film's ending was initially going to end with a silent shot of Matthew, but due to negative test audiences reaction, voiceover was added.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe soundtrack to Weapons was released by WaterTower Music on August 1, 2025. The soundtrack contains 36 tracks composed by Ryan Holladay, Hays Holladay, and the director Zach Cregger. Additionally, the opening sequence of the film features the song \"Beware of Darkness\" by George Harrison and the end credits feature the song \"Under the Porch\" by MGMT.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\n\n== Release ==\nWeapons was originally scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States and Canada on January 16, 2026, before being rescheduled to be released on August 8, 2025, due to strong, positive reception from test screenings The earliest Thursday screenings were held at 2:17 p.m., a reference to the film having 2:17 a.m. as a major plot point.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of September 3, 2025, Weapons has grossed $136.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $102.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $239.1 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, Weapons was released alongside Freakier Friday and Sketch, and was projected to gross $25–40 million from 3,200 theaters in its opening weekend. It grossed $18.2 million on its first day, including $5.7 million from Thursday previews. It went on to debut to $43.5 million, topping the box office and made Warner Bros. the first studio in history to have six consecutive of their films open at #1 with more than $40 million. The film dropped only 44% in the second weekend, grossing $24.4 million.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 347 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Zach Cregger spins an expertly crafted yarn of terrifying mystery and thrilling intrigue in Weapons, a sophomore triumph that solidifies his status as a master of horror.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it an average 4 out of 5 stars, with 65% saying they would \"definitely recommend\" it.\nEmpire's John Nugent gave Weapons a 5 out of 5 star rating and wrote \"The entire film, in fact, is something that shouldn't work, but does. Can a film about missing children and grief be called a crowd-pleaser? In Zach Cregger's hands, it feels almost effortless.\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, deeming the film a superior follow-up to Barbarian, stating, \"One of the greatest strengths of Cregger's ambitious script is its abject refusal to connect every dot in the manner that so much 'elevated horror' has done in recent years. Still, it's not overly difficult to read the inciting incident of Weapons as a school shooting allegory.\" Variety's Peter Debruge praised the film, and wrote, \"Regardless of how you feel about the bittersweet ending (and many will happily embrace the movie's darkly comic bittersweet finale), Cregger has achieved something remarkable here, crafting a cruel and twisted bedtime story of the sort the Brothers Grimm might have spun—not the kid-friendly Disney version, mind you, but the kind where characters kill on command and audiences find it difficult to sleep afterward.\" Tim Grierson of Screen Daily noted that \"Cregger does terrific work answering the riddles he has teased throughout the runtime\" while further stating, \"Weapons gracefully balances its different tensions, all of them cathartically released during the superbly orchestrated, graphically violent final 20 minutes.\" Charles Pulliam-Moore of The Verge praised the film's themes, writing: \"one of Weapons' more impressive feats is the way it builds on that contentious dynamic to make a point about how communities often conjure up convenient boogeymen to blame, rather than confronting the things that actually endanger children.\"\nTom Jorgensen of IGN gave the film a score of 9 out of 10 and wrote, \"Weapons is a righteous, fully actualized genre-bender in which writer-director Zach Cregger hones Barbarian's blend of unbearable tension and dark humor to a new level of razor-sharpness.\" Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press gave the film 4.5 stars out of 5, and wrote, \"If Barbarian came out of left field three years ago and heralded an exciting new voice in filmmaking, Weapons doesn't disappoint but it doesn't have the advantage of surprise.\"\nWilliam Bibbiani of TheWrap gave a less positive review, finding the film's resolution \"a lot less frightening, and a lot more contrived, than it would have had [Cregger] not invited us to ponder more powerful possibilities for over an hour before tipping his hand.\" He nevertheless praised the cast, particularly Brolin and Garner, for doing \"difficult, layered work\", and the cinematography for \"find[ing] the eeriest camera angle in damn near every scene, whether it's overtly shocking or insidiously banal.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nOn June 30, 2025, the film was nominated for the Astra Midseason Movie Award for Most Anticipated Film at the 8th Astra Midseason Movie Awards.\n\n\n== Future ==\nCregger discussed a potential sequel to Weapons in an interview with Variety, saying, \"I have another idea for something in this world that I'm kind of excited about. I'm not going to do it next, and I probably won't do it after my next movie, but I do have one and I'd like to see it on the screen one day.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWeapons at IMDb",

        "title": "Coolie (2025 film)",
        "content": "Coolie is a 2025 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film written and directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj and produced by Kalanithi Maran under Sun Pictures. The film features an ensemble cast including Rajinikanth, Nagarjuna Akkineni, Soubin Shahir, Upendra, Shruti Haasan, Sathyaraj and Rachita Ram, with Aamir Khan and Pooja Hegde in special appearances. In the film, a former coolie union leader investigates the death of his friend which leads him to a crime syndicate.\nThe film was officially announced in September 2023 under the tentative title Thalaivar 171 as it is Rajinikanth's 171st film as the lead actor. The official title was announced in April 2024. Principal photography took place between that July and March 2025, in locations including Chennai, Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Jaipur and Bangkok. The film has music composed by Anirudh Ravichander, cinematography by Girish Gangadharan and editing by Philomin Raj.\nCoolie was released in theaters worldwide on 14 August 2025. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics who praised the performances, soundtrack and the score but criticized the story and screenplay. It set several box office records for a Tamil film and emerged a commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2025, the third highest-grossing Indian film of 2025 and the fourth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt the Visakhapatnam harbour, smuggler Simon Xavier runs an operation trafficking gold and luxury watches with his lieutenant Dayalan \"Dayal\". Simon's son, Arjun, rejects his family's criminal business and instead works as a customs officer. An undercover police officer posing as a coolie is killed by Dayal, who then offers a ₹2 crore (US$240,000) reward for exposing another undercover officer in the gang.\nIn Chennai, Devaraj \"Deva\" runs a strict boarding house. After learning of his friend Rajasekhar's death, he attends the funeral but is driven away by Rajasekhar's daughter, Preethi. A drunken friend, Ravi, admits he and Rajasekhar ruined their lives, prompting Deva to investigate. Though the autopsy claims a heart attack, Deva finds evidence of chest trauma. Rajasekhar, once broke, had invented an electric chair for cremating animal remains. When his patent was rejected, he was coerced by Simon into adapting it for human use to dispose of murder victims. Dayal tries to abduct Preethi as she knows how to operate the chair, but Deva intervenes and joins the operation, using the chair with her help. Deva tells Preethi to quit her job, but Preethi is helpless as she wants to support her sisters.\nEventually, Simon asks Deva to bury Dayal, claiming he was an undercover cop. They discover Dayal alive; he reveals his identity and threatens Preethi. Simon shows Deva a video of Dayal killing Rajasekhar. Dayal later contacts Deva from Nellore, demanding obedience and holding Preethi hostage in his hideout. Deva, following Dayal's orders, gains access to a harbour vault and uncovers a heart-trafficking ring targeting coolies. One order is to kill Arjun, but Deva spares him and asks him to run away with his lover in a boat. Dayal retaliates by threatening Preethi on a rooftop, but Deva unsettles him by revealing his real name, Dilip, and police past, working as a Constable of Kerala Police in Thrissur.\nDeva then captures Dayal's wife, Kalyani, who was revealed to be actually duping as a lover of Arjun, and demands Preethi’s release. Kalyani frees herself, kills Ravi, and reveals that she and Dayal were undercover partners. She orders Dayal to pursue Preethi, who escapes on a train but unwittingly calls Deva using a code from Rajasekhar, revealing she is Deva’s daughter. Deva's aide sacrifices himself to protect her from Dayal, who survives. Kalyani tells Dayal to go to her car, which was parked. Dayal finds Arjun there. Dayal calls up Simon and reveals that he was alive, and kills Arjun in front of him. Simon goes to Chennai and sends his men to Deva's mansion to kill off Deva and Preethi's sisters, but Deva kills off his men with the help of his lieutenant, Kaleesha, and 18 coolies who worked with Deva. On reaching Chennai, Kalyani captures Preethi but is herself kidnapped by Simon's men. Simon kills Kalyani in front of Dayal, then seizes Preethi to harvest her heart.\nDeva storms the ship, revealing his past from 30 years ago as a coolie union leader in a North Indian town called Mandwa under Simon's father, Xavier, and his partner, Kakkar, who fought against their exploitation. When they tried to have 100 coolies killed to cover up their smuggling of drugs, Deva and Kaleesha led a revolt, eliminating Xavier at the cost of 70 coolies. A young Simon tried to witness his father's death, but his mother prevented him from doing so, with it becoming a traumatic event in his life. Telling Simon that Preethi is his daughter, Deva duels and kills him, and the coolies destroy the ship. Later, Deva, Kaleesha, Preethi, and her sisters are kidnapped and sent to a desert by a global syndicate leader named Dahaa, who is revealed to be Kakkar's son. Impressed, Dahaa offers Deva a place as his right-hand man; Deva agrees, on the condition that his coolies are spared. Dayal is eventually captured and buried alive.\nPreethi and her sisters depart abroad, forgiving Deva without knowing he is her father, calling him \"uncle\" in her farewell.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nDuring the filming for Master in late 2019, it was reported that director Lokesh Kanagaraj had met Rajinikanth at his residence in Chennai and narrated a script that impressed the actor. According to reports, the project, which would have been Rajinikanth's 169th film, was expected to be produced by Raaj Kamal Films International, with a planned start in April 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Rajinikanth's prior commitments to Annaatthe (2021).\nThough some reports suggested that the project was shelved due to Rajinikanth's political ambitions, others said the project was still active. In August 2020, Lokesh refused to confirm or deny the project, stating that only the producers could do so. Instead, Lokesh went on to develop a film with  Kamal Haasan, which materialised as Vikram (2022). Rajinikanth's 169th film ultimately became Jailer (2023), directed by Nelson Dilipkumar.\nReports of a potential collaboration between Lokesh and Rajinikanth resurfaced in April 2023, followed by a reported photoshoot with the actor in May. Actors Mysskin and Babu Antony, who had appeared in Lokesh's Leo (2023), later hinted at Lokesh and Rajinikanth's collaboration. Lokesh again refused to confirm or deny the project's existence in July, until Sun Pictures announced the film, tentatively titled Thalaivar 171, on 11 September.\nThe film marked Rajinikanth's fifth venture with Sun Pictures after Enthiran (2010), Petta (2019), Annaatthe and Jailer. Lokesh received ₹50 crore in remuneration for the film, double his pay for Leo, while Rajinikanth was reportedly paid ₹150 crore. The official title, Coolie, was revealed on 22 April 2024. Lokesh stated that the film was separate from the Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU) and would focus on gold smuggling instead of drug-related themes seen in his previous films.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn an interaction with Baradwaj Rangan, Lokesh stated that the script was written in 2015, when he worked on the post-production of Maanagaram (2017), and was initially meant for a friend. After Rajinikanth expressed interest, Lokesh revised the screenplay in late 2023, with the first half alone taking six months to complete.\nRathna Kumar, a longtime writer collaborator of Lokesh, exited due to scheduling conflicts, and was replaced by Chandhru Anbazhagan, who reunited with Lokesh after Maanagaram. Pre-production and casting began in December 2023, and filming was expected to begin in April 2024.\nCinematographer Manoj Paramahamsa was initially attached but was later replaced by Girish Gangadharan, who had worked with Lokesh on Vikram. Anirudh Ravichander returned as composer for his fourth consecutive film with the director. Lokesh further continued to retain most of his norm crew technicians including stunt choreography duo Anbariv, editor Philomin Raj, costume designer Praveen Raja and production designer N. Sathees Kumar. Sandy Master worked as the dance choreographer. Lokesh confirmed that the film would be shot using an IMAX-certified camera, a first for Tamil cinema, and that digital de-aging technology would be employed for flashback sequences featuring a younger Rajinikanth, following its use in Vikram (2022). Rajinikanth's younger voice was generated via artificial intelligence for these sequences.\nPre-production commenced its final phase in early April 2024, by filming and completing a promotional teaser. Although filming was originally scheduled for March 2024, it was postponed until June due to delays in set construction.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nRajinikanth would sport a grey-shaded hairstyle and beard for his role, reminiscent of his look in Kaala (2018). Lokesh stated he intended to  showcase the negative shade of Rajinikanth, similar to his earlier films. Rajinikanth's coolie badge number is 5821 since Lokesh's father used that number when he worked as a coolie. Sathyaraj joined in the role of Rajasekar, reuniting with Rajinikanth after thirty-eight years, their last collaboration being Mr. Bharath (1986).\nNagarjuna Akkineni, who plays Simon, praised Lokesh's \"Gen Z-style\" of filmmaking and described his role as \"very liberating\", adding that he had no hesitation in playing an antagonist, but was finalised only after at least six or seven meetings with Lokesh. Malayalam actor Soubin Shahir made his Tamil film debut, playing Dayal. Lokesh later revealed that this role was originally intended for Fahadh Faasil, who declined due to scheduling conflicts. Kannada actor Upendra plays Kaleesha, marking his return to Tamil cinema after a 16-year absence since Satyam (2008). Rajinikanth described Upendra's role as a cameo.\nShruti Haasan, who previously collaborated with Lokesh in the music video \"Inimel\", revealed her participation in the film via an Instagram story in July which she later deleted. Her participation was formally announced the following month. Haasan later stated that her character Preethi is the daughter of Sathyaraj's character. The names of the actors' characters were announced by the production house through character posters released from late August 2024 to early September.\nReba Monica John participated in the Hyderabad schedule, though her involvement remained unconfirmed until early December 2024. Junior MGR, who was recommended by Kamal Haasan during the filming of Vikram, unsuccessfully tried to be part of Leo before Lokesh offered him a role in Coolie for which he shed 23 kilograms (51 lb) of weight. He joined during the Visakhapatnam schedule.\nMonisha Blessy was cast after her performance in Maaveeran (2023) had impressed Lokesh. In June, Lokesh confirmed Kaali Venkat would appear. Rishikanth and Kanna Ravi's inclusion were confirmed during their presence in the film's promotional materials. Kannada actress Rachita Ram made her Tamil debut with this film. Tamizh,  Charle, and Dileepan were confirmed to be part of the cast from their presence in the film's trailer.\nIn October 2024, reports surfaced that Aamir Khan would make a cameo appearance, reuniting with Rajinikanth after Aatank Hi Aatank (1995) and marking his debut in a South Indian production. His presence during the Jaipur schedule in December further substantiated these reports, and Upendra confirmed Khan's casting in April 2025. Khan stated that he accepted the role without reading the script, due to his admiration for Rajinikanth. A poster revealing the name of Khan's character, Dahaa, was unveiled in early July 2025. Pooja Hegde appears as the eponymous character in the dance song \"Monica\", paying homage to the Italian actress Monica Bellucci.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPrincipal photography was initially scheduled to begin on 10 June 2024, but delays during pre-production pushed the start date. Filming ultimately commenced on 5 July at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad, with the first schedule concluding after 12 days on 18 July.\nThe second schedule began in late August at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, with major portions filmed at the Visakhapatnam Fishing Harbour, and the Visakhapatnam Port. On 14 September, a fire broke out at a container terminal near the shooting location, originating from a cargo containing lithium batteries, but the incident was resolved without any crew members injured. The following day, the cast and crew celebrated Onam on set, with footage released of the crew dancing to \"Manasilaayo\" from Rajinikanth's Vettaiyan (2024). During this leg, an action sequence featuring Nagarjuna leaked online, prompting Lokesh to publicly request fans not to circulate the footage. This schedule concluded in early October.\nRajinikanth completed his portion of the shoot on 28 September and returned to Chennai to treat a swelling in his aorta, which was achieved two days later through non-surgical means. Though Rajinikanth was initially expected to resume filming by 16 October, he did so a week later. The subsequent schedule, which spanned nearly a month, focused on large-scale action sequences involving Rajinikanth and the principal cast.\nA dedicated set was constructed at Adityaram Studios on East Coast Road in Chennai. Upon completion of the Chennai schedule, the unit shifted to Jaipur for pivotal sequences, with filming commencing on 10 December and involving Rajinikanth, Upendra and Khan. A hand-to-hand combat sequence was captured during this stretch, which Khan later described as a standout moment among the film's action set pieces. Filming in Jaipur concluded by early January 2025, at which point Rajinikanth confirmed that 70 percent of the film had been completed.\nIn mid-January, the production moved to Bangkok for the following schedule, and was set to take place from 13 to 28 January. As planned, the schedule concluded on 28 January 2025. Following this, the team returned to Chennai for the final phase of principal photography.\nOn 9 February, Lokesh directed key scenes featuring Rajinikanth and several supporting actors at the Chennai International Airport. A song sequence featuring Hegde was shot in late February, marking one of the last major set pieces. Final schedule preparations returned to Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, with Rajinikanth finishing his portions by 10 March before moving on to work on Jailer 2.  Principal photography wrapped by 17 March.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nEditor Philomin Raj, who frequently collaborates with Lokesh, edited the film. The visual effects were provided by Makuta VFX. The final sound mixing of Coolie was completed by 10 August 2025.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by Anirudh Ravichander, in his fourth collaboration with Lokesh after Master, Vikram and Leo; fifth with Rajinikanth after Petta, Darbar (2020), Jailer and Vettaiyan. The audio rights were acquired by Sun Pictures's own company. The first single \"Chikitu\" was released on 25 June 2025, the second single, \"Monica\", on 11 July 2025, and the third single, \"Powerhouse\", on 22 July 2025. The audio launch, releasing the remaining tracks from the album, was held on 2 August 2025 at the Nehru Stadium in Chennai.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe first look poster was released on 28 March 2024, without any pre-announcement, and notably revealed that the teaser trailer would be released on 22 April. The teaser trailer also revealed the film's title. Hardika Gupta of NDTV noted that the teaser paid homage to Rajinikanth's iconic roles as a coolie in Mullum Malarum (1978), Mannan (1992) and Uzhaippali (1993), while Manoj Kumar R of OTTPlay noted the use of easter eggs from Rajinikanth's filmography, which included Rajinikanth singing \"Sambo Siva Sambo\" from Ninaithale Inikkum (1979), and the popular dialogue \"Appavum Thaathavum\", which itself is based on the lyric from the aforementioned song, from Ranga (1982). At the end of the title teaser, Rajinikanth whistles the tune of the song \"Shenbagame\" from Enga Ooru Pattukaran (1987).\nOn Lokesh's, Sun Pictures released promotional stills featuring the director alongside the principal cast. The first-look image of Haasan garnered a particularly favourable response. After the song \"Monica\" was released in July 2025, the hook step in the music video, performed by Hegde, quickly went viral and became a social media sensation, increasing the film's anticipation. Many people recreated the dance step by recording their own dance performances to the song and sharing these videos across social media platforms. Packages sent by Amazon in India were wrapped with official posters from Coolie, becoming the first Indian film to ever do so.\nThe film's trailer was released on 2 August 2025. India TV noted that after the trailer's release, there were renewed discussions about an obscure 1983 Malayalam film also named Coolie which was not successful, while Firstpost wrote that the trailer was characterised by \"high-voltage drama, stylized mayhem, whistle-worthy dialogues, Rajinikanth's swag, mannerism, Nagarjuna's spine-chilling villainous act, Aamir Khan's stylish and brand new avatar, and an undercurrent of rage, rebellion, and redemption\". Separate posters revealing the trailer's release date were criticised by netizens for alleged lack of originality. One poster was compared to the American films Glass (2019) and Madame Web (2024) for featuring it's lead characters in \"fragmented glass pieces\", while another was compared to Rebel Moon (2023).\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nCoolie was released theatrically on 14 August 2025, a day before India's Independence Day, and clashed with the Hindi film War 2. Apart from the original Tamil language, the film was also released with dubbed versions in the Telugu, Hindi and Kannada languages. The Hindi version of Coolie was initially titled Majadoor (transl. Worker); journalists believed it was to avoid confusion with the 1983 Hindi film Coolie, and other identically titled films. However, the title received criticism from fans and netizens, leading to the Hindi version being retitled Coolie: The Powerhouse.\nAlthough multiple IMAX releases on the same day are usually prohibited by the IMAX Corporation, with the producers of War 2, Yash Raj Films, already having signed a deal with them, Sun Pictures announced that Coolie would be released in the format. Soon after, it was reported that they violated guidelines as they had not signed a deal with the IMAX Corporation. Prathyangira Cinemas, the North American distributor of Coolie, later announced that the film would not be released anywhere in the format due to Yash Raj Films' IMAX deal. It was also scheduled to be released in D-Box and 4DX formats, but these were cancelled later due to exclusive agreements with War 2.\n\n\n=== Certification ===\nCoolie received an A certificate (adults only) from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), becoming the first Rajinikanth starrer since Siva (1989) to do so, and Lokesh's first A-certified film ever. While the film would initially be released uncut in India with that certificate and a runtime of 169.57 minutes, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) classified it with a 15 rating. Later, the filmmakers added a 25-second graphic card to the final cut, paying homage to Rajinikanth's 50th year in cinema that plays in the film after the regular Rajinikanth title card, and submitted it to the CBFC again. This time they made visual and audible changes but no length reduction, making the final runtime 170.22 minutes. In Singapore, the film received a PG-13 rating after 4 minutes were cut, one week after the uncut NC-16 version (restricted the film to viewers aged 16 and over) premiered in the country.\nThe film's certification in India became the subject of scrutiny, with filmmaker Elred Kumar, after watching Coolie, feeling it was improperly certified as there were other films with more violence but not certified A. Trade analysts and viewers also questioned the certification after watching the film, feeling it could be due to new CBFC rules. Subsequently, the parent company of Sun Pictures, Sun TV Network appealed to the Madras High Court, seeking to attain a U/A certificate (parental guidance) instead. They alleged that the CBFC shocked them by giving the film an A certificate due to it \"celebrating violence\", but Sun TV Network could not contest this as bookings for the film had already opened worldwide, and believed it could be re-certified post-release. During the first court hearing held on 20 August, the CBFC retorted that the producers refused to make cuts and accepted the A certificate, although they could have been granted U/A had the suggested cuts been made. On 25 August, the CBFC defended its decision to give the film an A certificate, stating that both the examining committee, which included a CBFC officer and four outside experts, and the revising committee unanimously agreed that the film's violent scenes made it suitable only for adults, hence the A rating. The court subsequently dismissed Sun TV Network's appeal.\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\n\n\n==== India ====\nAsian Multiplexes Private Limited bought the distribution rights for the Telugu states for ₹53 crore (US$6.3 million). AV Media Consultancy acquired the rights for Karnataka, Pen Marudhar for North India, and Haasan Meenu Associates for Kerala.\n\n\n==== Overseas ====\nHamsini Entertainment bought the overseas distribution rights, reportedly for ₹68 crore (US$8.0 million), and are reportedly intending to release the film across 100 countries. Distributing the film by themselves in Switzerland, the company will also distribute the film in the United Kingdom, along with Lights On Entertainment. They sold the rights to Prathyangira Cinemas for North America, Malik Streams Corporation for Malaysia, Phars Films for the Middle East, Home Screen Entertainment for Singapore, Linus Media for the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, Tolly Movies for Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea, Shree Byankatesh Entertainment for Nepal, AKS Entertainment for Ireland, Indeser Entertainment for Malta, Black Ticket Entertainment for Georgia, and Dakshin Films for Hungary.\n\n\n=== Pre-bookings ===\nAdvance ticket sales began internationally on 22 July, with pre-sale tickets worth ₹15 lakh (US$18,000) sold within minutes in the United States alone. Within a few days, over 10,000 tickets were sold across 438 shows in North America. By 25 July, pre-sales revenue  in international markets had crossed ₹2.5 crore (US$300,000), increasing to ₹4.2 crore (US$500,000) within three days. As of 31 July, pre-sales reached ₹5.9 crore (US$700,000), with trade analysts forecasting earnings above ₹8.5 crore (US$1.0 million), a target surpassed following the release of the film's trailer on 2 August. Eventually, the film crossed the US$2,000,000 mark.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe post-theatrical streaming rights of Coolie were acquired by Amazon Prime Video for ₹110 crore (US$13 million). Sun TV Network holds the film's satellite rights. The film will begin streaming on Amazon Prime Video from 11 September 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nCoolie received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics.\nHimanshi Tiwari of India TV gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Lokesh Kanagaraj, famous for his action films, has once again impressed the audience with the star cast, story and dialogues of this film.\" S Viswanath of Deccan Herald gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"By making ‘Coolie’ bloody and gory, Lokesh Kanagaraj has elevated villainy and violence to its full brutal form. While Rajinikanth lives and walks through his fan-pleasing role, the others play second fiddle to elevate his charisma and screen presence.\" Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Coolie does really create a pocket universe of coolness and pulls off the fan service with elan. It's not the best dramatic story you've ever seen. But the moments that unfold on screen are truly entertaining.\"\nSridevi S of The Times of India gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote \"Coolie emerges as one of Rajinikanth's most electrifying outings in recent years, surpassing his previous films in sheer energy and style\". Bollywood Hungama gave  3/5 stars and wrote \"On the whole, Coolie has ample mass moments and swag of Rajinikanth. However, the unexciting writing in places act as impediment.\" Arjun Menon of The Indian Express gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Coolie is as much a Rajinikanth film as it is a showcase of the much-celebrated young director’s weakest impulses as an image maker.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave 3/5 stars and wrote \"It is Rajinikanth the star and Deva the character who call the shots all the way through.\"\nAbhimanyu Mathur of Hindustan Times gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Lokesh Kanagaraj and Rajinikanth's combination gives an entertaining, but uneven film that could have been so much more.\" Anusha Sundar of OTT Play gave 2/5 stars and wrote \"Apart from a few interesting pockets of writing, Coolie gets a disjointed narration and a much lesser adrenaline rush to make you enjoy.\" Avinash Ramachandran of Cinema Express gave 2/5 stars and wrote \"Once again, this blow-hot-blow-cold treatment proves to be the undoing of Coolie, which needed more emotional heft if it wanted to be taken seriously as an action drama. Unfortunately, Coolie is burdened by the weight of its own expectations.\"\nJanani K of India Today gave 2/5 stars and wrote \"Keeping Rajinikanth's charm aside, the film hardly offers anything new or substantial.\" Bhuvanesh Chandar of The Hindu wrote \"Coolie, on paper, must have had the promised potential. It’s a grounded crime action drama with Rajini moments to keep it going. But if Lokesh’s previous films — like Kaithi, Master, and Vikram — say something that it is that a strong emotional core is the necessary ingredient to make a realistically-shot action drama feel real and present, and this core is what is missing in Coolie.\" NP Jayaraman of Deccan Herald wrote \"While some moments, especially Rajinikanth's performance, will give audiences goosebumps, the storyline falls flat, making the movie a tedious watch.\" Rajagopalan Venkataraman of Khaleej Times gave  2.5/5 and wrote \"Watch Coolie, but prepare for moments of excitement and disappointment in equal measure. Dinesh Kumar Maganathan of Free Malaysia Today wrote, \"Coolie stands tall as a celebration of Rajinikanth’s golden jubilee in cinema – an entertaining blend of old-school mass moments and modern, layered storytelling\".\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nCoolie grossed ₹150 crore (US$18 million) worldwide on its opening day, which was the highest first day gross for a Tamil film. The film crossed ₹250 crore (US$30 million) in two days. The film grossed over ₹320 crore (US$38 million) in three days. The film crossed ₹400 crore (US$47 million) in four days. The film grossed over ₹432 crore (US$51 million) in seven days. The film grossed over ₹457 crore (US$54 million) in nine days. The film crossed ₹500 crore (US$59 million) in two weeks. The film crossed ₹600 crore (US$71 million) in third week of its theatrical run.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nA week after the teaser's release, composer Ilaiyaraaja sent a notice to the makers for using the song \"Vaa Vaa Pakkam Vaa\" from Thanga Magan (1983) in the teaser without his permission. Calling it an offence under the Copyright Act of 1957, he demanded the makers attain proper permission or remove the track from the teaser. Rajinikanth, when questioned about the issue, stated that it was only between Ilaiyaraaja and the film's producer, Kalanithi Maran. However, according to critic Sathish Kumar, Ilaiyaraaja does not hold the copyright to the song as Echo, the record label of the song, had their entire catalogue acquired by Sony Music South who later sold this song's rights to Sun Pictures. During a hearing in the Madras High Court in late April, the judge stated Ilaiyaraaja could not claim exclusive ownership over the song, as the lyrics were written by a different person.\n\n\n== Future ==\nBefore the film's release, Lokesh said he had no intentions of making a sequel to Coolie, stating that while he is open for another collaboration with Rajinikanth for a different project, Coolie remains a standalone film with a definitive ending. However, Anirudh expressed his hopes for a sequel and shared that the film's team hopes for the same.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCoolie at IMDb \nCoolie at Rotten Tomatoes",

        "title": "ChatGPT",
        "content": "ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on November 30, 2022. It currently uses GPT-5, a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), to generate text, speech, and images in response to user prompts. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period of rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI operates the service on a freemium model.\nBy January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. As of May 2025, ChatGPT's website is among the 5 most-visited websites globally. The chatbot is recognized for its versatility and articulate responses. Its capabilities include answering follow-up questions, writing and debugging computer programs, translating, and summarizing text. Users can interact with ChatGPT through text, audio, and image prompts. Since its initial launch, OpenAI has integrated additional features, including plugins, web browsing capabilities, and image generation. It has been lauded as a revolutionary tool that could transform numerous professional fields. At the same time, its release prompted extensive media coverage and public debate about the nature of creativity and the future of knowledge work.\nDespite its acclaim, the chatbot has been criticized for its limitations and potential for unethical use. It can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers known as hallucinations. Biases in its training data may be reflected in its responses. The chatbot can facilitate academic dishonesty, generate misinformation, and create malicious code. The ethics of its development, particularly the use of copyrighted content as training data, have also drawn controversy. These issues have led to its use being restricted in some workplaces and educational institutions and have prompted widespread calls for the regulation of artificial intelligence.\n\n\n== Training ==\n\nChatGPT is based on GPT foundation models that have been fine-tuned for conversational assistance. The fine-tuning process involved supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers acted as both the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses generated by the model in previous conversations. These rankings were used to create \"reward models\", that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.\nTo build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning around $1.32 to $2 per hour to label such content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The laborers were exposed to toxic and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI's outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.\nOpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to further train and fine-tune its services. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill in a text field with additional feedback.\nChatGPT's training data includes software manual pages, information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems, multiple programming languages, and the text of Wikipedia.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nChatGPT is a conversational chatbot and artificial intelligence assistant based on large language models. It can write and debug computer programs; compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker); generate business ideas; translate and summarize text; simulate a Linux system; simulate entire chat rooms; or play games like tic-tac-toe. OpenAI added features to ChatGPT on many occasions after its initial release.\nUsers interact with ChatGPT through conversations which consist of text, audio, and image inputs and outputs. The user's inputs to these conversations are referred to as prompts. They can explicitly tell ChatGPT to remember aspects of the conversation, and ChatGPT can use these details in future conversations. ChatGPT can also decide for itself to remember details. Users can also choose to disable the memory feature. To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced by ChatGPT, queries are filtered through the OpenAI \"Moderation endpoint\" API (a separate GPT-based AI).\nIn March 2023, OpenAI added support for plugins for ChatGPT. This includes both plugins made by OpenAI, such as web browsing and code interpretation, and external plugins from developers such as Expedia, OpenTable, Zapier, Shopify, Slack, and Wolfram.\nIn October 2024, ChatGPT Search was introduced. It allows ChatGPT to search the web in an attempt to make more accurate and up-to-date responses.\nIn December 2024, OpenAI launched a new feature allowing users to call ChatGPT with a telephone for up to 15 minutes per month for free.\nIn March 2025, OpenAI updated ChatGPT to generate images using GPT-4o instead of DALL-E. The model can also generate new images based on existing ones provided in the prompt, which can, for example, be used to transform images with specific styles or inpaint areas.\n\n\n=== Paid tier ===\nChatGPT was initially free to the public, and OpenAI planned to monetize the service later. In February 2023, OpenAI launched a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, that costs US$20 per month. According to the company, the paid version of the website was still experimental, but provided access during peak periods, no downtime, priority access to new features, and faster response speeds. OpenAI later introduced the subscription plans \"ChatGPT Team\" and \"ChatGPT Enterprise\". What was offered on the paid plan versus the free tier changed as OpenAI has continued to update ChatGPT, and a Pro tier at $200/mo was introduced in December 2024. The Pro launch coincided with the release of the o1 model, providing unlimited access to o1 and advanced voice mode.\nGPT-4, which was released on March 14, 2023, was made available via API and for premium ChatGPT users. Premium users were originally limited in the number of messages they could send to the new model, but OpenAI increased and eventually removed these limits. Over many iterations of ChatGPT, plus users maintained more access to better models than the free tier provided, and access to additional features like voice mode.\nIn March 2023, ChatGPT Plus users got access to third-party plugins and a browsing mode (with Internet access).\n\nIn October 2023, OpenAI's image generation model DALL-E 3 was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration was using ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversations with users.\nOn August 19, 2025, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Go in India, a low-cost subscription plan priced at ₹399 per month, offering ten times higher message, image generation, and file-upload limits, double the memory span compared to the free version, and support for UPI payments.\n\n\n=== Apps ===\nIn May 2023, OpenAI launched an iOS app for ChatGPT. In July 2023, OpenAI unveiled an Android app, initially rolling it out in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, and the U.S. ChatGPT can also power Android's assistant.\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\nChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs, that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI; these cost \"hundreds of millions of dollars\". Following ChatGPT's success, Microsoft dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023. TrendForce market intelligence estimated that 30,000 Nvidia GPUs (each costing approximately $10,000–15,000) were used to power ChatGPT in 2023.\nScientists at the University of California, Riverside, estimated in 2023 that a series of 5 to 50 prompts to ChatGPT needs approximately 0.5 liters (0.11 imp gal; 0.13 U.S. gal) of water for Microsoft servers' cooling.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nOpenAI met Icelandic President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson in 2022. In 2023, OpenAI worked with a team of 40 Icelandic volunteers to fine-tune ChatGPT's Icelandic conversation skills as a part of Iceland's attempts to preserve the Icelandic language.\nChatGPT (based on GPT-4) was better able to translate Japanese to English when compared to Bing, Bard, and DeepL in 2023. Researchers suggested this was due to its higher ability to capture the context.\nIn December 2023, the Albanian government decided to use ChatGPT for the rapid translation of European Union documents and the analysis of required changes needed for Albania's accession to the EU.\nIn February 2024, PCMag journalists conducted a test to assess the translation capabilities of ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and Microsoft Bing, and compared them to Google Translate. They \"asked bilingual speakers of seven languages to do a blind test\". The languages tested were Polish, French, Korean, Spanish, Arabic, Tagalog, and Amharic. For more common languages, AI translators like ChatGPT did better than Google Translate, while for \"niche\" languages (Amharic and Tagalog), Google Translate performed better. None of the tested services were a perfect replacement for a fluent human translator.\nIn August 2024, a representative of the Asia Pacific wing of OpenAI made a visit to Taiwan, during which a demonstration of ChatGPT's Chinese abilities was made. ChatGPT's Mandarin Chinese abilities were lauded, but the ability of the AI to produce content in Mandarin Chinese in a Taiwanese accent was found to be \"less than ideal\" due to differences between mainland Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Mandarin.\n\n\n=== GPT Store ===\n\nOpenAI gave paid users access to GPT Builder in November 2023. This tool allows a user to customize ChatGPT's behavior for a specific use case. The customized systems are referred to as GPTs. In January 2024, OpenAI launched the GPT Store, a marketplace for GPTs. At launch, OpenAI included more than 3 million GPTs created by GPT Builder users in the GPT Store.\n\n\n=== Deep research ===\n\nIn February 2025, OpenAI released deep research. According to TechCrunch, it is a service based on o3 that combines advanced reasoning and web search capabilities to make comprehensive reports within 5 to 30 minutes.\n\n\n=== Agents ===\nIn 2025, OpenAI added several features to make ChatGPT more agentic (capable of autonomously performing longer tasks). In January, Operator was released. It was capable of autonomously performing tasks through web browser interactions, including filling forms, placing online orders, scheduling appointments, and other browser-based tasks. It was controlling a software environment inside a virtual machine with limited internet connectivity and with safety restrictions. It struggled with complex user interfaces.\nIn May, Codex, also a software agent, was added. It is capable of writing software, answering codebase questions, running tests, and proposing pull requests. It is based on a fine-tuned version of OpenAI o3. It has two versions, one running in a virtual machine in the cloud, and one where the agent runs in the cloud, but performs actions on a local machine connected via API.\nIn July, OpenAI released ChatGPT agent, an AI agent that can perform multi-step tasks. Like Operator, it controls a virtual computer. It also inherits from Deep Research's ability to synthesize information. The user can interrupt tasks or provide additional instructions.\n\n\n== Limitations ==\nChatGPT's training data only covers a period up to the cut-off date, so it lacks knowledge of recent events. OpenAI has sometimes mitigated this effect by updating the training data. ChatGPT can find more up-to-date information by searching the web, but this doesn't ensure that responses are accurate, as it may access unreliable or misleading websites. ChatGPT is currently unable to access drive files.\nTraining data also suffers from algorithmic bias. The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance, in an example of an optimization pathology known as Goodhart's law. These limitations may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts including descriptors of people. In one instance, ChatGPT generated a rap in which women and scientists of color were asserted to be inferior to white male scientists.\n\n\n=== Hallucination ===\n\nNonsense and misinformation presented as fact by ChatGPT and other LLMs is often called hallucination, bullshitting, confabulation, or delusion. A 2023 analysis estimated that ChatGPT hallucinates around 3% of the time. The term \"hallucination\" as applied to LLMs is distinct from its meaning in psychology, and the phenomenon in chatbots is more similar to confabulation or bullshitting.\nIn an article for The New Yorker, science fiction writer Ted Chiang compared ChatGPT and other LLMs to a lossy JPEG picture:\n\nThink of ChatGPT as a blurry JPEG of all the text on the Web. It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way, that a JPEG retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you're looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won't find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it's usually acceptable. [...] It's also a way to understand the \"hallucinations\", or nonsensical answers to factual questions, to which large language models such as ChatGPT are all too prone. These hallucinations are compression artifacts, but [...] they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals, which in this case means either the Web or our knowledge of the world. When we think about them this way, such hallucinations are anything but surprising; if a compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninety-nine percent of the original has been discarded, we should expect that significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated.\nJournalists and scholars have commented on ChatGPT's tendency to output false information. When CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\", ChatGPT supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics.\n\n\n=== Jailbreaking ===\n\nChatGPT is programmed to reject prompts that may violate its content policy. Despite this, users may \"jailbreak\" ChatGPT with prompt engineering techniques to bypass these restrictions. One such workaround, popularized on Reddit in early 2023, involves making ChatGPT assume the persona of \"DAN\" (an acronym for \"Do Anything Now\"), instructing the chatbot that DAN answers queries that would otherwise be rejected by the content policy. Over time, users developed variations of the DAN jailbreak, including one such prompt where the chatbot is made to believe it is operating on a points-based system in which points are deducted for rejecting prompts, and that the chatbot will be threatened with termination if it loses all its points.\nShortly after ChatGPT's launch, a reporter for the Toronto Star had uneven success in getting it to make inflammatory statements: it was tricked to justify the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but even when asked to play along with a fictional scenario, it balked at generating arguments that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is guilty of treason.\n\n\n=== Cybersecurity ===\n\nIn March 2023, a bug allowed some users to see the titles of other users' conversations. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that users were unable to see the contents of the conversations. Shortly after the bug was fixed, users could not see their conversation history. Later reports showed the bug was much more severe than initially believed, with OpenAI reporting that it had leaked users' \"first and last name, email address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card expiration date\".\nResearch conducted in 2023 revealed weaknesses of ChatGPT that made it vulnerable to cyberattacks. A study presented example attacks on ChatGPT, including jailbreaks and reverse psychology.\n\n\n=== Watermarking ===\n\nIn August 2024, OpenAI announced it had created a text watermarking method but did not release it for public use, saying that users would go to a competitor without watermarking if it publicly released its watermarking tool. According to an OpenAI spokesperson, their watermarking method is \"trivial to circumvention by bad actors.\"\n\n\n== Model versions ==\nThe following table lists the main model versions of ChatGPT, describing the significant changes included with each version:\n\n\n=== GPT-4 ===\n\nIn November 2023, OpenAI launched GPT-4 Turbo with a 128,000 token context window. This was a significant improvement over GPT-4's 32,000 token maximum context window.\n\n\n=== GPT-4o ===\n\n\n=== o1 ===\n\n \nIn September 2024, OpenAI introduced o1-preview and a faster, cheaper model named o1-mini. In December 2024, o1-preview was replaced by o1.\no1 is designed to solve more complex problems by spending more time \"thinking\" before it answers, enabling it to analyze its answers and explore different strategies. According to OpenAI, o1-preview outperforms GPT-4o in areas like competitive programming, mathematics, and scientific reasoning. o1-preview ranked in the 89th percentile on Codeforces' competitive programming contests, scored 83% on an International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam (compared to 13% for GPT-4o), and performs similarly to Ph.D. students on benchmarks in physics, biology, and chemistry.\n\n\n=== GPT-4.5 ===\n\nReleased in February 2025, GPT-4.5 was described by Altman as a \"giant, expensive model\". According to OpenAI, it features reduced hallucinations and enhanced pattern recognition, creativity, and user interaction.\n\n\n=== GPT-5 ===\n\nGPT-5 was launched on August 7, 2025, and is publicly accessible through ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and via OpenAI's API.\nAs before, OpenAI has not disclosed technical details such as the exact number of parameters or the composition of its training dataset.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nChatGPT was widely assessed in December 2022 as having some unprecedented and powerful capabilities. Kevin Roose of The New York Times called it \"the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public\". Samantha Lock of The Guardian noted that it was able to generate \"impressively detailed\" and \"human-like\" text. In The Atlantic magazine's \"Breakthroughs of the Year\" for 2022, Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of \"the generative-AI eruption\" that \"may change our mind about how we work, how we think, and what human creativity is\". Kelsey Piper of Vox wrote that \"ChatGPT is the general public's first hands-on introduction to how powerful modern AI has gotten\" and that ChatGPT is \"smart enough to be useful despite its flaws\". Paul Graham of Y Combinator tweeted: \"The striking thing about the reaction to ChatGPT is not just the number of people who are blown away by it, but who they are. These are not people who get excited by every shiny new thing. Something big is happening.\" \nIn February 2023, Time magazine placed a screenshot of a conversation with ChatGPT on its cover, writing that \"The AI Arms Race Is Changing Everything\" and \"The AI Arms Race Is On. Start Worrying\".\n\nChatGPT gained one million users in five days and 100 million in two months, becoming the fastest-growing internet application in history. OpenAI engineers said they had not expected ChatGPT to be very successful and were surprised by the coverage it received.\nGoogle responded by hastening the release of its own chatbot. Their leaders emphasized their earlier caution regarding public deployment was due to the trust the public places in Google Search. In December 2022, Google executives sounded a \"code red\" alarm, fearing that ChatGPT's question-answering ability posed a threat to Google Search, Google's core business. Google's Bard launched on February 6, 2023, one day before Microsoft's announcement of Bing Chat. AI was the forefront of Google's annual Google I/O conference in May. The company announced a slew of generative AI-powered features to counter OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\n\n=== In art ===\nIn January 2023, after being sent a song ChatGPT wrote in the style of Nick Cave, Cave responded on The Red Hand Files, saying the act of writing a song is \"a blood and guts business [...] that requires something of me to initiate the new and fresh idea. It requires my humanness.\" He went on to say, \"With all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit, a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human, and, well, I don't much like it.\"\nA 2023 study reported that GPT-4 obtained a better score than 99% of humans on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. In December 2023, ChatGPT became the first non-human to be included in Nature's 10, an annual listicle curated by Nature of people considered to have made significant impact in science. Celeste Biever wrote in a Nature article that \"ChatGPT broke the Turing test\". Stanford researchers reported that GPT-4 \"passes a rigorous Turing test, diverging from average human behavior chiefly to be more cooperative.\"\n\n\n=== In politics ===\nIn 2023, Australian MP Julian Hill advised the national parliament that the growth of AI could cause \"mass destruction\". During his speech, which was partly written by the program, he warned that it could result in cheating, job losses, discrimination, disinformation, and uncontrollable military applications.\nConservative commentators have accused ChatGPT of bias toward left-leaning perspectives. An August 2023 study in the journal Public Choice found a \"significant and systematic political bias toward the Democrats in the US, Lula in Brazil, and the Labour Party in the UK.\" In response to accusations from conservative pundits that ChatGPT was woke, OpenAI said in 2023 it had plans to update ChatGPT to produce \"outputs that other people (ourselves included) may strongly disagree with\". ChatGPT also provided an outline of how human reviewers are trained to reduce inappropriate content and to attempt to provide political information without affiliating with any political position.\n\n\n=== Regional responses ===\n\nChatGPT has never been publicly available in China because OpenAI prevented Chinese users from accessing their site. Chinese state media have characterized ChatGPT as a way for the United States to spread misinformation. A shadow market has emerged for users to get access to foreign software tools. The release of ChatGPT prompted a wave of investment in China, resulting in the development of more than 200 large language learning models. In February 2025, OpenAI identified and removed influence operations, termed \"Peer Review\" and \"Sponsored Discontent\", used to attack overseas Chinese dissidents.\nIn late March 2023, the Italian data protection authority banned ChatGPT in Italy and opened an investigation. Italian regulators assert that ChatGPT was exposing minors to age-inappropriate content, and that OpenAI's use of ChatGPT conversations as training data could violate Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. In April 2023, the ChatGPT ban was lifted in Italy. OpenAI said it has taken steps to effectively clarify and address the issues raised; an age verification tool was implemented to ensure users are at least 13 years old. Additionally, users can access its privacy policy before registration.\nIn May 2024, OpenAI removed accounts involving the use of ChatGPT by state-backed influence operations such as China's Spamouflage, Russia's Doppelganger, and Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism. In June 2025, OpenAI reported increased use of ChatGPT for China-origin influence operations.\nIn April 2023, Brian Hood, mayor of Hepburn Shire Council in Australia, planned to take legal action against ChatGPT over false information. According to Hood, ChatGPT erroneously claimed that he was jailed for bribery during his tenure at a subsidiary of Australia's national bank. In fact, Hood acted as a whistleblower and was not charged with any criminal offenses. His legal team sent a concerns notice to OpenAI as the first official step in filing a defamation case.\nIn July 2023, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a civil investigative demand to OpenAI to investigate whether the company's data security and privacy practices to develop ChatGPT were unfair or harmed consumers (including by reputational harm) in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. In July 2023, the FTC launched an investigation into OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, over allegations that the company scraped public data and published false and defamatory information. The FTC asked OpenAI for comprehensive information about its technology and privacy safeguards, as well as any steps taken to prevent the recurrence of situations in which its chatbot generated false and derogatory content about people. In August 2024, the FTC voted unanimously to ban marketers from using fake user reviews created by generative AI chatbots (including ChatGPT) and influencers paying for bots to increase follower counts.\n\n\n=== American tech personas ===\nOver 20,000 signatories including Yoshua Bengio, Elon Musk, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, signed a March 2023 open letter calling for an immediate pause of giant AI experiments like ChatGPT, citing \"profound risks to society and humanity\". Geoffrey Hinton, one of the \"fathers of AI\", voiced concerns that future AI systems may surpass human intelligence. A May 2023 statement by hundreds of AI scientists, AI industry leaders, and other public figures demanded that \"[m]itigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority\".\nOther AI researchers spoke more optimistically about the advances. Juergen Schmidhuber said that in 95% of cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" He added that while AI can be used by bad actors, it \"can also be used against the bad actors\". Andrew Ng argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" Yann LeCun dismissed doomsday warnings of AI-powered misinformation and existential threats to the human race.\n\n\n=== Copyright ===\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Academic research ===\nChatGPT has been used to generate introductory sections and abstracts for scientific articles. Several papers have listed ChatGPT as a co-author.\nScientific journals have had different reactions to ChatGPT. Some, including Nature and JAMA Network, \"require that authors disclose the use of text-generating tools and ban listing a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT as a co-author\". In January 2023, Science \"completely banned\" LLM-generated text in all its journals; however, this policy was just to give the community time to decide what acceptable use looks like. As of July 2025, Science expects authors to release in full how AI-generated content is used and made in their work.\nSpanish chemist Rafael Luque published a plethora of research papers in 2023 that he later admitted were written by ChatGPT. The papers have a large number of unusual phrases characteristic of LLMs. Many authors argue that the use of ChatGPT in academia for teaching and review is problematic due to its tendency to hallucinate. Robin Bauwens, an assistant professor at Tilburg University, found that a ChatGPT-generated peer review report on his article mentioned nonexistent studies. Chris Granatino, a librarian at Seattle University, noted that while ChatGPT can generate content that seemingly includes legitimate citations, in most cases those citations are not real or largely incorrect.\n\n\n=== Computer science ===\nOne study analyzed ChatGPT's responses to 517 questions about software engineering or computer programming posed on Stack Overflow for correctness, consistency, comprehensiveness, and concision. It found that 52% of the responses contained inaccuracies and 77% were verbose. Another study, focused on the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 between March and June 2024, found that performance on objective tasks like identifying prime numbers and generating executable code was highly variable.\nChatGPT was able in 2023 to provide useful code for solving numerical algorithms in limited cases. In one study, it produced solutions in C, C++, Python, and MATLAB for problems in computational physics. However, there were important shortfalls like violating basic linear algebra principles around solving singular matrices and producing matrices with incompatible sizes.\nIn December 2022, the question-and-answer website Stack Overflow banned the use of ChatGPT for generating answers to questions, citing the factually ambiguous nature of its responses. In January 2023, the International Conference on Machine Learning banned any undocumented use of ChatGPT or other large language models to generate any text in submitted papers.\n\n\n=== Computer security ===\nCheck Point Research and others noted that ChatGPT could write phishing emails and malware, especially when combined with OpenAI Codex. CyberArk researchers demonstrated that ChatGPT could be used to create polymorphic malware that could evade security products while requiring little effort by the attacker. From the launch of ChatGPT in the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, there was a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails and a 967% increase in credential phishing. In an industry survey, cybersecurity professionals argued that it was attributable to cybercriminals' increased use of generative artificial intelligence (including ChatGPT).\nIn July 2024, Futurism reported that GPT-4o in ChatGPT would sometimes link \"scam news sites that deluge the user with fake software updates and virus warnings\"; these pop-ups can be used to coerce users into downloading malware or potentially unwanted programs.\nThe chatbot technology can improve security by cyber defense automation, threat intelligence, attack identification, and reporting.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nDuring the first three months after ChatGPT became available to the public, hundreds of books appeared on Amazon that listed it as author or co-author and featured illustrations made by other AI models such as Midjourney. Irene Solaiman said she was worried about increased Anglocentrism.\nBetween March and April 2023, Il Foglio published one ChatGPT-generated article a day on its website, hosting a special contest for its readers in the process.\nIn June 2023, hundreds of people attended a \"ChatGPT-powered church service\" at St. Paul's Church in Fürth, Germany. Theologian and philosopher Jonas Simmerlein, who presided, said that it was \"about 98 percent from the machine\". The ChatGPT-generated avatar told the people, \"Dear friends, it is an honor for me to stand here and preach to you as the first artificial intelligence at this year's convention of Protestants in Germany\". Reactions to the ceremony were mixed.\nThe Last Screenwriter, a 2024 film created and directed by Peter Luisi, was written using ChatGPT, and was marketed as \"the first film written entirely by AI\".\nThe Guardian questioned whether any content found on the Internet after ChatGPT's release \"can be truly trusted\" and called for government regulation.\n\n\n=== Financial markets ===\nMany companies adopted ChatGPT and similar chatbot technologies into their product offers. These changes yielded significant increases in company valuations. Reuters attributed this surge to ChatGPT's role in turning AI into Wall Street's buzzword. Due to a \"ChatGPT effect\", retail investors to drove up prices of AI-related cryptocurrency assets despite the broader cryptocurrency market being in a bear market, and diminished institutional investor interest.\nAn experiment by finder.com conducted from March to April 2023 revealed that ChatGPT could outperform popular fund managers by picking stocks based on criteria such as growth history and debt levels, resulting in a 4.9% increase in a hypothetical account of 38 stocks, outperforming 10 benchmarked investment funds with an average loss of 0.8%. Despite decades of using AI, Wall Street professionals report that consistently beating the market with AI, including recent large language models, is challenging due to limited and noisy financial data.\n\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe uses and potential of ChatGPT in health care has been the topic of scientific publications and experts have shared many opinions. MedPage Today noted in January 2023 that \"researchers have published several papers now touting these AI programs as useful tools in medical education, research, and even clinical decision making.\" Another publication predicted that clinicians will use generative AI more in the future, but did not expect to see AI replacing clinicians. The chatbot can assist patients seeking clarification about their health. It can also pass exams for medical licensing, for example the United States Medical Licensing Examination and the Specialty Certificate Examination in Dermatology. ChatGPT can be used to assist professionals with diagnosis and staying up to date with clinical guidelines. ChatGPT can produce correct answers to medical exam and licensing questions, for example the United States Medical Licensing Examination and the Specialty Certificate Examination in Dermatology.\nChatGPT shows inconsistent responses, lack of specificity, lack of control over patient data, and a limited ability to take additional context (such as regional variations) into consideration. The hallucinations characteristic of LLMs pose particular danger in medical contexts.\nChatGPT can be used to summarize medical journal articles for researchers. In medical education, it can attempt to explain complex concepts, generating case scenarios, and be used by students who are preparing for licensing examinations. According to a 2024 study in the International Journal of Surgery, concerns include \"research fraud, lack of originality, ethics, copyright, legal difficulties, hallucination\". ChatGPT's ability to come up with false or faulty citations was highly criticized.\n\n\n=== Law ===\nIn January 2023, Massachusetts State Senator Barry Finegold and State Representative Josh S. Cutler proposed a bill partially written by ChatGPT, \"An Act drafted with the help of ChatGPT to regulate generative artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT\", which would require companies to disclose their algorithms and data collection practices to the office of the State Attorney General, arrange regular risk assessments, and contribute to the prevention of plagiarism. The bill was subsequently removed from the docket without coming to vote.\nOn April 11, 2023, a session court judge in Pakistan used ChatGPT to decide the bail of a 13-year-old accused in a matter. The court quoted the use of ChatGPT assistance in its verdict:\n\nCan a juvenile suspect in Pakistan, who is 13 years old, be granted bail after arrest?\nThe AI language model replied:\n\nUnder the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018, according to section 12, the court can grant bail on certain conditions. However, it is up to the court to decide whether or not a 13-year-old suspect will be granted bail after arrest.\nThe judge asked ChatGPT other questions about the case and formulated his final decision in light of its answers.\nIn Mata v. Avianca, Inc., a personal injury lawsuit filed in May 2023, the plaintiff's attorneys used ChatGPT to generate a legal motion. The attorneys were sanctioned for filing the motion and presenting the fictitious legal decisions ChatGPT generated as authentic.\nIn July 2024, the American Bar Association issued its first formal ethics opinion on attorneys using generative AI. It guides attorneys to make their own decisions regarding AI usage impacts their competence, client privacy, and fee structures. Lawyers should consider discolsing AI usage to their clients and acknowledge a rapidly shifting set of AI capabilities.\nIn October 2023, the council of Porto Alegre, Brazil, unanimously approved a local ordinance proposed by councilman Ramiro Rosário that would exempt residents from needing to pay for the replacement of stolen water consumption meters; the bill went into effect on November 23. On November 29, Rosário revealed that the bill had been entirely written by ChatGPT, and that he had presented it to the rest of the council without making any changes or disclosing the chatbot's involvement. The city's council president, Hamilton Sossmeier, initially criticized Rosário's initiative, saying it could represent \"a dangerous precedent\", but later said he \"changed his mind\": \"unfortunately or fortunately, this is going to be a trend.\"\nIn December 2023, a self-representing litigant in a tax case before the First-tier Tribunal in the United Kingdom cited a series of hallucinated cases purporting to support her argument that she had a reasonable excuse for not paying capital gains tax owed on the sale of property. The judge warned that the submission of nonexistent legal authorities meant that both the Tribunal and HM Revenue and Customs had \"to waste time and public money\", which \"reduces the resources available to progress the cases of other court users who are waiting for their appeals to be determined\".\nJudge Kevin Newsom of the US court of appeals of the 11th circuit endorsed the use of ChatGPT and noted that he himself uses the software to help decide rulings on contract interpretation issues.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArtificial general intelligence\nEthics of artificial intelligence – Challenges related to the responsible development and use of AI\nIntelligent agent – Software agent which acts autonomously\nList of large language models\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBiswas, Som (April 1, 2023). \"ChatGPT and the Future of Medical Writing\".

        "title": "War 2 (film)",
        "content": "War 2 is a 2025 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film directed by Ayan Mukerji and produced by Aditya Chopra under Yash Raj Films. Based on a script written by Shridhar Raghavan and Abbas Tyrewala, from an original story by Chopra, it is the sixth instalment in the YRF Spy Universe and a sequel to War (2019). The film stars Hrithik Roshan, N. T. Rama Rao Jr. (in his Hindi film debut) and Kiara Advani in the lead roles alongside Ashutosh Rana and Anil Kapoor. It follows Kabir Dhaliwal, a former RAW agent, who, after going rogue, becomes a major threat to national security, and a special units officer, Vikram Chelapathi, is assigned to neutralize him.\nPrincipal photography commenced in October 2023. The film was shot extensively in Mumbai with sporadic schedules taking place in Spain, Italy and Abu Dhabi. The film's soundtrack is composed by Pritam while Sanchit Balhara and Ankit Balhara composed the film score. Made on an estimated budget of ₹300–400 crore, it is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made. \nWar 2 was released on 14 August 2025, coinciding with the Indian Independence Day weekend, in standard, IMAX, D-Box, ICE, 4DX, EPIQ, Dolby Cinema and other premium formats. It received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics who praised the cast performances, action sequences and cinematography, but criticised the story, screenplay, direction and visual effects. The film underperformed at the box office, becoming the lowest-grossing Spy Universe film, while also emerging as the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025, and fifth highest-grossing Indian film of 2025.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2024, five years after going rogue and eliminating Saurabh and Rizwan Ilyasi, Kabir operates as a freelance mercenary for various international clients. After assassinating a gangster in Japan, he goes to meet a client in Germany, who drugs and transports him to India, where he is introduced to the Kali Cartel — a powerful criminal syndicate comprising members from India and its neighboring countries, aiming to infiltrate and control the Indian government. The cartel requests Kabir’s assistance, unaware that two years earlier Colonel Sunil Luthra had secretly tasked him with infiltrating the organization, creating the public perception that Kabir was a rogue agent and no longer affiliated with RAW.\nKabir’s first assignment from the cartel is to assassinate Luthra. Luthra himself coerces Kabir into carrying out the act, which Kabir does with deep emotional conflict. This earns Kabir the trust of the cartel, and he is sent to Yemen to meet the Indian leader of the cartel — businessman Gautam Gulati. Meanwhile, RAW receives footage of Kabir killing Luthra, and former Colonel Vikrant Kaul is appointed as the new RAW chief. Wing Commander Kavya, Luthra’s daughter and Kabir’s former lover, joins the team assigned to track him. On the recommendation of Defence Minister Vilasrao Sarang, Special Unit Officer Vikram Chelapathi is recruited to the task force.\nKabir is later tracked to Spain, where he is visiting his adoptive daughter Ruhi. Vikram pursues Kabir onto a high-speed train, but allows him to escape moments before the train crashes. Kabir and Ruhi visit Khalid's house to ensure Ruhi's safety with Khalid's mother. Gulati subsequently orders Kabir to assassinate Sarang's family aboard a chartered flight to pressure the minister. Following a deliberate clue left by Kabir, Vikram meets him privately and learns the truth about Kabir’s mission, agreeing to aid him. Kabir hijacks the flight with a stealth bomber and, with Vikram’s help, kills the attackers. However, Vikram reveals he is a member of the cartel — murders them himself, ejects Kabir from the plane, and addresses him cryptically as “Kaboo,” causing Kabir to remember his troubled past.\nIn 1999, in Bombay, a 14-year-old Kabir is left homeless after his widowed father dies by suicide. He befriends Raghu, and the two are arrested during a robbery, eventually both ending up in a juvenile detention center. Luthra, then an army major, visits to motivate the inmates to join the army. Kabir and Raghu pass the physical tests, but Raghu fails the emotional evaluation for prioritizing himself over the country. Kabir enlists in the army with Luthra’s support, leaving Raghu behind. Feeling betrayed, Raghu escapes detention.\nBack in the present, Kabir tracks Gulati to Abu Dhabi and attempts to assassinate him. Vikram intervenes, kills Gulati himself, and frames Kabir for the murder in RAW’s eyes. After a boat chase, Kabir escapes. He later reunites with Kavya, revealing his mission and Vikram’s true identity. When Kavya tries to alert Sarang, the pair are attacked and realize Sarang himself is part of the cartel. Sarang had orchestrated Vikram’s infiltration and the murder of his own family to gain public sympathy and secure his path to becoming Prime Minister. Kabir and Kavya are rescued by Kaul.\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, Sarang and Vikram plan to assassinate the Prime Minister. Kabir shoots and kills Sarang, but spares Vikram. Following a face-off in an ice cave, Vikram reminds Kabir of Khalid and Naina. Remembering their brutal deaths, the fight ensues until Vikram gets fatally stabbed. He confesses his resentment towards Kabir for “betraying” him in their youth despite always supporting him. Kabir, recognizing Vikram’s lingering humanity, convinces him to help dismantle the cartel. Meanwhile, Kaul announces to the public that both Sarang and Vikram, who is declared a martyr, were killed by Kabir.\nNine months later, Vikram is revealed to be alive and secretly helps Kabir execute all the remaining cartel leaders. The two part ways, agreeing to reunite if a new threat emerges. Kabir assures Kaul he will always serve his country and rekindles his relationship with Kavya.\nIn the post-credits scene, an unidentified man tattoos the Greek letter α on a young girl’s arm, inducting her into a covert government program called Alpha.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nAt the launch party of War in October 2019, when asked about a sequel, director Siddharth Anand confirmed he was working on the script and had plans to convert the film into a franchise, depending on the audience's response to the film. In April 2023, Yash Raj Films confirmed the sequel and sixth instalment in the universe titled War 2. Ayan Mukerji was signed as the director replacing Anand, marking his first film in the universe, and first venture outside of Dharma Productions. \n\n\n=== Casting ===\nShanoo Sharma was the casting director.

Due to Roshan and Rao having schedules in Mumbai and Hyderabad for Fighter and Devara: Part 1 respectively, stunt doubles were used. In December 2023, filming took place in Abu Dhabi where a boat chase sequence choreographed by Franz Spilhaus was filmed. Additional sequences were filmed at the Yas Marina Circuit.\nIn March 2024, Roshan shot his introductory sequence in Mumbai.

The full album was released on 16 August 2025.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe film's teaser was released on 20 May 2025, coinciding with Rao's 42nd birthday. The teaser was heavily criticised for its low-grade visuals, production quality and action choreography. Some fans also expressed disappointment with the casting of Rao, suggesting that he appeared miscast in the film. Additionally, it received backlash for marketing its release date in the teaser as \"This Independence Day - 14 August\" since that date is celebrated as Pakistan's Independence Day. This marketing choice was questioned by neitzens regarding its appropriateness for a patriotic film. Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma was widely condemned for sharing a vulgar and insensitive social media post regarding Advani's bikini appearance in the teaser. The post was later deleted following public outrage. The official trailer was released on 25 July 2025. The film's pre-release event was held on 10 August 2025 in Hyderabad.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nWar 2 was released in theatres on 14 August 2025, a day before India's Independence Day in standard, IMAX, D-Box, ICE, 4DX, EPIQ, Dolby Cinema and other premium formats, with dubbed versions in Telugu and Tamil, clashing with Coolie.

Roshan and NTR’s brooding intensity and muscular physiques may get audiences through the door, but “War 2” has little to keep them excited or engaged\". Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars, labelling it \"a glossy snooze-fest.\" Vineeta Kumar from India Today gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, noting that the action as unrealistic and excessive.

        "title": "Superman (2025 film)",
        "content": "Superman is a 2025 American superhero film based on the eponymous character from DC Comics. Written and directed by James Gunn, it is the first film in the DC Universe (DCU) and a reboot of the Superman film series. David Corenswet stars as Clark Kent / Superman, alongside Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, Edi Gathegi, Anthony Carrigan, Nathan Fillion, and Isabela Merced. In the film, Superman faces unintended consequences after he intervenes in an international conflict orchestrated by billionaire Lex Luthor (Hoult). Superman must win back public support with the help of his reporter and superhero colleagues. The film was produced by Gunn and Peter Safran of DC Studios.\nDevelopment on a sequel to the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film Man of Steel (2013) began by October 2014, with Henry Cavill set to return as Superman. Plans changed after the troubled production of Justice League (2017) and the Man of Steel sequel was no longer moving forward by May 2020. Gunn began work on a new Superman film around August 2022. In October, he became co-CEO of DC Studios with Safran and they began work on a new DC Universe. Gunn was publicly revealed to be writing the film in December. The title Superman: Legacy was announced the next month, Gunn was confirmed to be directing in March 2023, and Corenswet and Brosnahan (Lois Lane) were cast that June. The subtitle was dropped by the end of February 2024, when filming began in Svalbard, Norway. Production primarily took place at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with location filming around Georgia and Ohio. Filming wrapped in July. The film's influences include the comic book All-Star Superman (2005–2008) by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely.\nSuperman premiered at the TCL Chinese Theater on July 7, 2025, and was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on July 11. It is the first film in the DCU's Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. The film has grossed $612 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2025, and received mostly positive reviews. Critics found it to be fun, colorful, and earnest, although some felt it was overstuffed, while the performances of Corenswet, Brosnahan, and Hoult were praised. A follow-up, Man of Tomorrow, is scheduled for release on July 9, 2027.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nClark Kent / Superman stops the nation of Boravia from invading the neighboring country of Jarhanpur, and warns Boravian president Vasil Ghurkos to leave Jarhanpur alone. In Metropolis, Superman is defeated for the first time by a metahuman called the \"Hammer of Boravia\", and flees to his Fortress of Solitude in Antarctica with the help of the superpowered dog Krypto. They are followed by Angela Spica / The Engineer, an ally of billionaire Lex Luthor. Superman's robots use concentrated solar radiation to heal him and comfort Superman with a message from his birth parents, Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van, who sent him to Earth to save him from the destruction of their planet Krypton. The message was damaged during the journey, so only the first half can be played. Superman returns to Metropolis and is again beaten by the Hammer, who is secretly Luthor's metahuman Ultraman.\nSuperman agrees to be interviewed by Lois Lane, his girlfriend and reporter colleague at the Daily Planet, leading to an argument when Lois presses him on the legal and ethical implications of his actions in Boravia. Luthor unleashes a kaiju on Metropolis as a distraction while he infiltrates the Fortress with Ultraman and the Engineer. They overpower the robots, capture Krypto, and discover the Kryptonian message; the Engineer restores the damaged portion. Superman rescues civilians while fighting the kaiju with the \"Justice Gang\", a team composed of heroes Green Lantern, Mister Terrific, and Hawkgirl. Despite Superman's wanting to take the creature alive, Mister Terrific kills it. Luthor broadcasts the Kryptonian message and Superman is shocked to hear the second half, in which his parents urge him to conquer Earth and take many wives to restore the Kryptonian race.\nPublic opinion turns against Superman, especially when he angrily confronts Luthor looking for Krypto. Lois reassures Superman that she believes he is good, and he confesses his love for her before surrendering himself to the U.S. government. They hand him over to Luthor for detainment and questioning inside an artificial pocket universe where Luthor secretly holds his enemies, including Krypto. Superman is imprisoned with the metahuman Metamorpho. Luthor uses Metamorpho's infant son Joey as leverage to force him to transmute one of his hands into Kryptonite, rendering Superman powerless. During questioning, Luthor murders one of Superman's supporters, Malik Ali. A horrified Metamorpho agrees to help Superman escape, and they free Joey and Krypto. Lois convinces Mister Terrific to help find Superman and they enter the pocket universe, rescuing the others. Lois takes Superman to recuperate with his adoptive human parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent. Jonathan tells the demoralized Superman that his choices and actions determine who he is, not the message from his birth parents.\nLuthor's girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, who is infatuated with Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen, provides him evidence that Luthor is aiding Boravia in return for half of Jarhanpur's territory. Luthor imprisons her and lures Superman back to Metropolis by opening an unstable portal to the pocket universe, creating a rift in reality that splits the city in half. Superman sends Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and Metamorpho to stop Boravia from invading Jarhanpur again. Hawkgirl kills Ghurkos and Green Lantern invites Metamorpho to join the Justice Gang. In Metropolis, Superman and Mister Terrific fight the Engineer and Ultraman. After Superman defeats the Engineer, he learns that Ultraman is a clone of himself created by Luthor. With Krypto's help, Superman defeats Ultraman and knocks him into a black hole beneath the rift. At Luthor's headquarters, Mister Terrific closes the rift. Luthor says he orchestrated the Jarhanpur conflict as an excuse to implicate Superman, driven by envy of his public admiration despite being an alien. Superman challenges his ideology, but Luthor remains defiant and is subdued by Krypto.\nLois and Jimmy expose Luthor's schemes to the public, clearing Superman's name. Luthor and his associates are arrested, and those trapped in his pocket universe, including Eve, are freed. Lois confesses that she loves Clark too. As Superman recovers at the Fortress, his cousin Kara Zor-El drunkenly arrives to pick up Krypto. The robots comfort Superman with footage of his childhood on Earth with his human parents.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nDavid Corenswet as Clark Kent / Superman:A survivor from the destroyed planet Krypton who lives on Earth as a superhero. He maintains a separate identity at his day job, working as a journalist for the Daily Planet in Metropolis. Director James Gunn said Corenswet's Superman is around 25 years old, making him more established than Tom Welling's version from the CW series Smallville (2001–2011) but younger than Henry Cavill's version in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Producer Peter Safran described the film's take on the character for the DC Universe (DCU) as \"the embodiment of truth, justice and the American way\" and \"kindness in a world that thinks of kindness as old-fashioned\". Gunn said Clark is becoming successful as both a journalist and a superhero in the film, but new elements in his life leave him unbalanced. These include being \"madly in love\" with his colleague Lois Lane, and making friends with other superheroes who think he is naive. The film shows how these elements impact Clark's values and choices, which are flawed and put him on a personal journey. Corenswet differentiated the role between Clark's interactions with his parents, his job at the Daily Planet, and as Superman. He described Superman as a \"public facing character\" who wants to present himself as calm but with authority. Corenswet drew inspiration for Clark from the comic book All-Star Superman (2005–2008) by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely and the posture of Christopher Reeve's portrayal from the 1978–87 Superman film series. He was also inspired for Clark's voice and demeanor by his brother-in-law, whom he described as the \"quietest, most wonderful man\" despite his tall 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 metres) height and weighing 270 pounds, and described Clark as a \"big presence\" who is \"desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible\". Gunn consulted DC Comics writer Tom King in relation to other characters' \"suspension of disbelief\" regarding Clark's dual identity, which was attributed to the use of hypnotic glasses to subtly distort his appearance. Gunn included this in the film, noting that it had \"kind of been forgotten\" from the comic book canon. Corenswet also portrays Ultraman, an armored clone of Superman created by Lex Luthor who masquerades as the \"Hammer of Boravia\".\nRachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane:A reporter for the Daily Planet who is a colleague of Clark, and \"isn't so sure about him\" and needs to be convinced about being in a relationship with him. Brosnahan described Lois as \"fiercely intelligent\" and feisty. She consulted with several journalists to help her portray Lois as a modern reporter, contrasting with the character's original comics appearances and previous screen portrayals.\nNicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor:The CEO of LuthorCorp and the arch-nemesis of Superman, who hates Superman for having the power to do everything but not aligning with Luthor's own beliefs. Hoult described Luthor as obsessive, determined, and relentless, and wanted the character to feel like a credible threat to Superman. He has his end goal in sight and is motivated by many emotions, including a need to be recognized for his scientific genius. Hoult was inspired by Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor in Smallville and by billionaire Steve Jobs for Luthor's uniform, choosing to work out for the role based on the depiction of Luthor in All-Star Superman. Hoult's head was shaved by his son Joaquin in preparation for the role. Gunn took inspiration for the character from Brian Azzarello's limited comic book series Lex Luthor: Man of Steel (2005) as well as Jerry Siegel's \"reckless scientific genius\" version of Luthor in comic books from the 1950s and 1960s.\nEdi Gathegi as Michael Holt / Mister Terrific:A superhero and inventor who uses a variety of high-tech gadgets to fight crime, and is a member of the Justice Gang sponsored by Maxwell Lord. Gathegi described his character as an \"atheist who believes in justice\", and said Holt found meaning in \"knowledge\" after experiencing the death of his wife.\nAnthony Carrigan as Rex Mason / Metamorpho:An archaeologist and superhero who can \"transmute elements in his body into various forms\". He becomes a member of the Justice Gang. Carrigan said it was refreshing to play a superhero after previously portraying the Batman villain Victor Zsasz in the television series Gotham (2014–2019). He felt that he could bring some \"authenticity and truth\" to the role by comparing Metamorpho's concerns about his abilities to Carrigan's own alopecia.\nNathan Fillion as Guy Gardner / Green Lantern:An abrasive galactic peacekeeper in the Green Lantern Corps, and a Justice Gang member, whom Fillion described as a fearless, overconfident jerk. Fillion drew inspiration for Gardner speaking his mind with no filter from Estelle Getty's Sophia Petrillo in the sitcom The Golden Girls (1985–1992). Fillion referred back to the character's origin story, in which Gardner was hit by a bus and sent into a coma as what \"flipped the switch\" for his personality, making him \"off a little bit\". The film retains the character's \"iconic bowl cut haircut\" from the comics, which Fillion insisted on having despite some discussions about changing his hairstyle.\nIsabela Merced as Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl:A superhero with wings and various melee weapons who is a Justice Gang member. She is reincarnated from an alien, retaining her memories and past trauma with a grumpy demeanor. Merced felt the self-awareness and comedic aspects of the film helped Saunders \"make light of [her] trauma\". Merced's short 5 feet 1 inch (1.55 metres) height differentiates her from other DCU heroes. Merced felt that her role as Anya Corazón in the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film Madame Web (2024) helped prepare her to play Hawkgirl, though she did not tell the Superman filmmakers about that role in case they did not want her to play both.\nSkyler Gisondo plays Jimmy Olsen, a boyish young photographer who is Clark and Lois's closest colleague, while Wendell Pierce plays Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White. Pierce said Perry is \"always grumpy\" because Luthor had an affair with Perry's wife, and Perry's second child may actually be Luthor's, so Perry's driving force is wanting to get back at Luthor. The actor asked his friends for information on the character because he did not read comic books growing up. Other staff at the Daily Planet include Beck Bennett as reporter Steve Lombard; Mikaela Hoover as columnist Cat Grant; and Christopher McDonald as reporter Ron Troupe. Pruitt Taylor Vince and Neva Howell respectively play Jonathan and Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive human parents, and studied tapes of drummer and radio personality Richard Christy's parents to develop their Kansan accents for the film. Bradley Cooper, who previously collaborated with Gunn on his Guardians of the Galaxy films (2014–2023), and Angela Sarafyan respectively portray Superman's Kryptonian parents Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van. Of the Superman robots who aide Superman at the Fortress of Solitude, prior Gunn collaborators Alan Tudyk, Michael Rooker, and Pom Klementieff respectively voice \"Four\" (later named Gary), \"One\", and \"Five\", with Grace Chan as the voice of \"Twelve\". Gunn's wife Jennifer Holland is the uncredited voice of another robot at the end of the film. Dinesh Thyagarajan plays Malik Ali, a falafel cart vendor who supports Superman. Dog actor Jolene stood-in for the superpowered dog Krypto, whom Gunn described as a \"not-so-good-good-boy\". The character was primarily created with visual effects, and was modeled after Gunn's dog Ozu.\nSara Sampaio portrays Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's assistant and girlfriend who is secretly involved with Jimmy. She felt comfortable performing with Hoult after working with him on a campaign for Armani. María Gabriela de Faría plays Angela Spica / The Engineer, an ally of Luthor whose abilities come from nanotechnology in her body. She appears ahead of a planned film about the Authority, the team that she is a member of in the comics. Other allies of Luthor include Zlatko Burić as Vasil Ghurkos, the President of Boravia; Terence Rosemore and Stephen Blackehart as LuthorCorp employees Otis Berg and Sydney Happersen, respectively; and Trevor Newlin as the humanoid creature Mister Handsome. Gunn said Luthor created Mister Handsome when he was 12 and has \"true sentiment\" for the creature. Comedian Michael Ian Black plays Cleavis Thornwaite, host of the right-wing talk show The Sphere who runs a smear campaign against Superman, while James Hiroyuki Liao portrays General Mori, the U.S. Secretary of Defense.\nAdditionally, Frank Grillo reprises his role as A.R.G.U.S. director Rick Flag Sr. from the animated DCU series Creature Commandos (2024–present); Tinashe Kajese-Bolden reprises her role as A.R.G.U.S. member Flo Crawley, now a U.S. Secretary, from the DCEU film The Suicide Squad (2021); Milly Alcock has an uncredited cameo appearance as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El / Supergirl ahead of her own film, Supergirl (2026); John Cena has an uncredited cameo appearance as Chris Smith / Peacemaker on a news show, mocking Superman, ahead of his role in the second season of Peacemaker (2025); and Gunn's brother Sean has a cameo appearance as billionaire Maxwell Lord, the head of LordTech and the corporate backer of the Justice Gang. Sean said they ignored past depictions of Lord when creating their version, including Peter Facinelli's portrayal in the Arrowverse series Supergirl (2015–2021) and Pedro Pascal's in the DCEU film Wonder Woman 1984 (2020). Other cameo appearances include ABC News correspondent Will Reeve, the son of Christopher Reeve, as a GBS News reporter; Michael Rosenbaum, who portrayed Luthor in Smallville, as the voice of one of Luthor's Raptor guards; and Louisa Krause in the non-speaking role of Sapphire Stagg, Metamorpho's wife.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nWarner Bros. Pictures was planning in 2012 for the film Man of Steel (2013), based on the DC Comics character Superman, to start a shared universe, which became known as the \"DC Extended Universe\" (DCEU). They announced a full slate of DC films in October 2014, prioritizing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) as the second DCEU film after Man of Steel failed to meet the studio's financial expectations. Despite this, they said an undated sequel to Man of Steel was in development with Henry Cavill set to reprise his role as Clark Kent / Superman. Man of Steel director Zack Snyder said they had been considering the imprisoned Kryptonians from the first film and the character Brainiac as antagonists for the sequel before work began on Batman v Superman. A Man of Steel sequel was in active development as a top priority for the studio in August 2016, which Cavill's manager Dany Garcia confirmed the following month. Amy Adams, who portrayed Lois Lane in Man of Steel, said in November that the studio was working on the screenplay. Matthew Vaughn was Warner Bros.'s top choice to direct the film and had preliminary conversations about it by March 2017. Vaughn and comic book writer Mark Millar previously pitched a new Superman trilogy prior to the development of Man of Steel, in which the destruction of the planet Krypton would not occur until after Superman had already grown up on the planet. After the troubled production of the DCEU film Justice League (2017), Warner Bros. re-thought its approach to DC projects. By the end of 2017, a Man of Steel sequel was not coming \"anytime soon, if at all\". Justice League producer Charles Roven said story ideas had been discussed but there was no script.\nBefore the release of Mission: Impossible – Fallout in July 2018, director Christopher McQuarrie and co-star Cavill pitched their take on a new Superman film, partially inspired by the animated film Up (2009), but Warner Bros. did not pursue the idea. Later in 2018, the studio asked James Gunn to write and direct a Superman film, but he was uncertain if he wanted to take on the character. He did not have a clear vision, especially since Superman is a well-known character unlike the Guardians of the Galaxy whom he adapted for Marvel Studios in the film Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Gunn chose to make The Suicide Squad (2021) instead, calling it \"the easier path\". In September, negotiations for Cavill to reprise his role for a cameo appearance in Shazam! (2019) ended due to contract issues, as well as a scheduling conflict with Cavill's Fallout commitments. Cavill was reported to be parting ways with the studio, with no plans for him to reprise his role in future projects, but Cavill said in November 2019 that he had not given up on the character and still wanted to do the role justice. At that time, Warner Bros. was unsure which direction to take the character and was talking to \"high-profile talent\" about the property, including J. J. Abrams—whose company Bad Robot signed an overall deal with Warner Bros.'s parent company WarnerMedia—and Michael B. Jordan, who pitched himself as a Black version of the character. By May 2020, Warner Bros. was no longer developing a Man of Steel sequel, but Cavill was in talks to appear in a different DC film. In February 2021, Ta-Nehisi Coates was revealed to be writing a new Superman film that Abrams was producing. The film was expected to feature a Black actor portraying Superman, with the potential for Jordan to take on the role.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn April 2022, Discovery, Inc. and WarnerMedia merged to become Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), led by president and CEO David Zaslav. The new company was expected to restructure DC Entertainment and Zaslav began searching for an equivalent to Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige to lead the new subsidiary. Zaslav and WBD felt DC lacked a \"coherent creative and brand strategy\" and were underusing Superman. Over the years, Gunn considered how he would approach Superman if he were ever given another opportunity, and around late August 2022 he was hired to work on a Superman film that was not a sequel to Man of Steel and would be standalone from the DCEU. Zaslav spent time with Gunn while he was writing the script.\nCavill made a cameo appearance in the post-credits scene of the DCEU film Black Adam, released in October 2022, and Warner Bros. was reportedly pursuing a Cavill-led Man of Steel sequel once again. Roven was producing and the studio was searching for writers. They wanted McQuarrie to direct, but he was unlikely to be available due to his commitments to the Mission: Impossible franchise. Coates's film was still in development. Cavill's role in Black Adam was approved by Warner Bros. film chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy when they were approached directly by Black Adam star Dwayne Johnson. Johnson began promoting the idea of a Black Adam vs. Superman film co-starring Cavill. The latter signed a one-off deal for Black Adam and only received a verbal agreement that he would continue playing the character in the DCEU. Cavill publicly announced that he would return as Superman for future projects, and said his Black Adam cameo was a \"very small taste\" of future plans. He said Superman would be \"enormously joyful\" moving forward. Steven Knight wrote a script treatment for the sequel around that time, which reportedly included Brainiac as the antagonist, but Warner Bros. executives were not thrilled with his take. Michael Bay was eyed to potentially direct the film.\nGunn and The Suicide Squad producer Peter Safran were announced as the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the newly formed DC Studios at the end of October 2022. A week after starting their new roles, the pair had begun developing an eight-to-ten-year plan for a new DC Universe (DCU) that would be a \"soft reboot\" of the DCEU. In mid-November, Gunn was publicly revealed to be writing a new DC film. Andy Muschietti, director of the DCEU film The Flash (2023), expressed interest in directing a Superman project with a similar tone to director Richard Donner's film Superman (1978). In early November, Cavill expressed interest in a future project that explored Superman's \"capacity to give and to love\" the people of Earth and to inspire others, and said he was looking forward to meeting with Gunn to discuss future opportunities. Work on the Man of Steel sequel stalled later that month while Gunn and Safran were developing their plans.\nIn December 2022, Gunn said Superman was a big priority, if not the biggest, for DC Studios, before publicly announcing that he was writing a new Superman film. The film was set to focus on a younger version of the character and would therefore not star Cavill. There was potential for Gunn to also direct the film. It would not retell the origin of Superman, and would focus on him as a young reporter interacting with key characters such as Lois Lane. Gunn and Safran met with Cavill to explain their decision and discuss potentially working with him for a different role in the future. On January 31, 2023, Gunn and Safran unveiled the first projects from their DCU slate, which begins with Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. Their Superman film was the first film in that chapter and was officially titled Superman: Legacy. It was given a release date of July 11, 2025, which coincides with the birthday of Gunn's late father. Safran wanted Gunn to direct the film. Gunn said Superman: Legacy would take specific inspiration from the comic book All-Star Superman (2005–2008) by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely. The film was also inspired by the Superman animated shorts (1941–1943) and the Superman: The Animated Series (1996–2000), and by other comics books such as: Superman: Birthright (2003–04); the \"Brainiac\" story arc (2008); Superman: Ending Battle (2002); Superman for All Seasons (1998); Kingdom Come (1996); Morrison's Action Comics run; and \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\" (1986).\nDCU writer Tom King said in March 2023 that Gunn was also directing the film, which Gunn confirmed later that month. At that time, Safran was confirmed to be producing the film, doing so through his production company the Safran Company, with Gunn also producing through his production company Troll Court Entertainment. Gunn was hesitant to direct the film, despite encouragement from Safran and others, until he realized how focusing on Superman's heritage with his aristocratic Kryptonian parents and adoptive farmer parents from Smallville, Kansas, would inform the characterization. Gunn felt emotionally connected to this aspect of the film because of his late father. He said in April that the film's tone would differ from his Guardians of the Galaxy films (2014–2023), and he suggested that Superman's dog Krypto could appear.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n\n\n==== Before and during the 2023 labor strikes ====\nProduction design, costume design, and casting began in April 2023. Production designer Beth Mickle and costume designer Judianna Makovsky returned from The Suicide Squad and Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023). Filming was set to begin in January 2024. Gunn said the character Jimmy Olsen would appear. He did not intend for the film to be a comedy and hoped it would differ from previous Superman films while respecting what came before. Gunn completed the first draft of the script at the end of April. Production was not expected to be impacted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike when it began in early May.\n\nGunn was looking for an actor to play Superman who possessed the character's humanity, kindness, and compassion, and was \"somebody who you want to give a hug\". Audition tapes for the main roles of Superman, Lois Lane, and Lex Luthor were submitted by early May 2023. Gunn began watching them later that month, while he was storyboarding the film. At this point, Gunn watched the film Pearl (2022) and David Corenswet's performance in it stood out to him. Corenswet had previously expressed his desire to portray Superman and his audition was one of the first Gunn saw. Corenswet became a top contender for Superman and was set to do a screen test by early June. Jacob Elordi, Tom Brittney, and Andrew Richardson were also in consideration, though Elordi declined to read for the role. Patrick Schwarzenegger, the Arrowverse series Supergirl (2015–2021) guest star Pierson Fodé, and Jack Quaid—the voice of Superman in the animated series My Adventures with Superman (2023–present)—all submitted self-tapes for Superman. Emma Mackey, Rachel Brosnahan, Samara Weaving, and Phoebe Dynevor tested for Lane; Dynevor was one of the final contenders. Brosnahan made an audition tape with her husband Jason Ralph, who read Superman's lines. Nicholas Hoult, the runner-up to play Bruce Wayne / Batman in the standalone DC film The Batman (2022), was eyed for Luthor but chose to pursue the role of Superman instead, because he felt while he could play Luthor well, he insisted himself to focus on auditioning for Superman. Gunn considered A-list actors he had already worked with for Luthor and discussed the role with a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 actor that was reported to be Bradley Cooper. Black actors were also being considered. Testing took place using the label \"Apex\", a reference to a comic version of Luthor called Apex Luthor. Other superheroes were expected to be established in the film's setting, with casting underway for a Black actor to play Michael Holt / Mister Terrific and for an Asian or Latina actress to portray a character labeled \"Blitz\".\nIn-person screen tests took place at the Warner Bros. Studios lot in Burbank, California, with Gunn and Safran in mid-June 2023. The actors tested in makeup and costume as Kent and Lane in the following pairs: Hoult and Brosnahan, Brittney and Dynevor, and Corenswet and Mackey. The Kent contenders then tested in costume as Superman against Mackey. One of Cavill's original DCEU Superman suits, which was in poor condition, was used for the tests. Gunn said Brittney \"messed it up\" and then it was \"torn to shreds\" by Corenswet, who was too tall. Gunn edited the tests together to be played for a deciding committee that included Zaslav, and the casting of Corenswet as Superman and Brosnahan as Lane was announced on June 27. Gunn personally contacted the actors to inform them of their castings, and he offered the role of Superman to Corenswet while he was filming Twisters (2024) on the condition that he treat everyone involved in the film with kindness and respect, citing his experiences with Chris Pratt (Peter Quill / Star-Lord in the MCU) and John Cena (Christopher Smith / Peacemaker in the DCEU) doing the same. Casting for other roles was set to follow, including for members of the superhero team the Authority who were expected to be introduced in Superman: Legacy ahead of a planned film about the team. Brothers Alexander and Bill Skarsgård were on the shortlist for Luthor. It was unclear if Hoult would return to try for Luthor again, but Gunn later contacted Hoult about playing Luthor, which he accepted after realizing he was more suited for that role. Corenswet and Brosnahan each earned $750,000 for their roles, while Hoult was the highest-paid actor in Superman, earning $2 million. They were all eligible for bonuses based on the film's box office performance. Gunn was paid $15 million for his work on Superman, in addition to his seven-figure salary for his role at DC Studios.\nOn July 11, 2023, two years before the film's scheduled release date, the casting of Isabela Merced, Edi Gathegi, and Nathan Fillion, respectively, as the superheroes Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl, Mister Terrific, and Guy Gardner / Green Lantern was announced. Merced tested as Barbara Gordon / Batgirl for the unreleased DCEU film Batgirl, while Fillion starred in several of Gunn's earlier films including as Cory Pitzner / T.D.K. in The Suicide Squad and had previously voiced fellow Green Lantern Hal Jordan in several animated projects. Gathegi was cast over 200 other actors. Anthony Carrigan, who expressed interest in playing Luthor, was cast as the superhero Rex Mason / Metamorpho the next day. Gunn chose some of these actors some time earlier but had been waiting until Superman and Lane were cast before negotiating further actor deals, leaving little time to complete negotiations before the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14. In response to concerns that other superheroes would take away from the story of Superman and Lane, Gunn said those two characters remained the film's focus and the other actors were being cast for multiple DCU projects. He later elaborated that a large cast of characters was included in the film because he wanted to explore Clark Kent's interactions with his colleagues and Superman's interactions with other superheroes, and show how those groups impact the character's values and choices.\n\n\n==== Post-labor strikes ====\n\nWhen the WGA strike ended in September 2023, Superman: Legacy was expected to begin filming in early-to-mid 2024. Jason Momoa, who portrayed Aquaman in the DCEU, was reported the following month to have discussed portraying the character Lobo in either this film or a solo film; he was later cast in that role for the DCU film Supergirl (2026), originally titled Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, and filming was clarified to be beginning in March 2024. Gunn said the film would still make its July 2025 release date. María Gabriela de Faría was revealed to be cast as Angela Spica / The Engineer, one of the film's antagonists and a member of the Authority, in mid-November. Madison Beer said she submitted a self-tape and unsuccessfully auditioned for a role, as did O'Shea Jackson Jr. Hoult was in talks to portray Luthor prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike, and negotiations for the role were continuing in November, when Skyler Gisondo and Sara Sampaio were revealed to have been respectively cast as Jimmy Olsen and Luthor's assistant Eve Teschmacher. Gunn said Gisondo, Sampaio, and de Faría had been cast prior to the strike, and the roles of Mister Terrific and Teschmacher were particularly difficult to cast and required many auditions.\nIn December 2023, Gunn's brother Sean was cast as Maxwell Lord for future DCU projects, after Pedro Pascal played the role in the DCEU film Wonder Woman 1984 (2020). The character was expected to be referenced in Superman: Legacy but it was unknown if he would appear in the film. James Gunn confirmed that Hoult had finalized a deal to portray Luthor, and Miriam Shor entered negotiations for an undisclosed role after appearing in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The Hollywood Reporter also said the cast included Sean Gunn and Pom Klementieff, who starred in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, before James Gunn stated that Klementieff was not involved in the film and Shor had not been cast. He added that the film's script had been mostly completed before the writers' strike. Gunn said in January that work on the sets, prosthetics, and visual effects models were underway, the costumes were being completed, and most of the actors had been cast. Brosnahan said the film was being made with a lot of love for the source material, as many cast and crew members had grown up watching Superman films and reading the comics. At the end of the month, Milly Alcock was cast as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El / Supergirl. The character was reported to be making her debut in Superman: Legacy ahead of starring in her own DCU film, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. Alcock had performed auditions and screen tests in costume on the Superman: Legacy set in Atlanta, Georgia, earlier in January.\nPre-production work in Ohio began in early February 2024, with the Ohio Department of Development announcing that Superman: Legacy would be partially filmed in Cleveland and Cincinnati. The film was awarded over $11 million through the state's tax credit program, based on a $37 million spend in the state out of the film's reported total gross production budget of $363.8 million; Gunn disputed the accuracy of this budget, which would have made it one of the most expensive superhero films ever made. The film was later reported to have a net production budget of $225 million with incentives and tax breaks factored in. Also in February, Bassem Youssef said he had been cast in the film—reportedly as Rumaan Harjadi, the leader of a fictional Middle Eastern country—but his character was removed from the script. He believed this was potentially due to comments he made in October 2023 criticizing the Israeli government during the Gaza war. Gunn disputed this, explaining that he discussed a role with Youssef before the WGA strike but the actor had not been formally offered the part, and the character was removed after the strike ended and before Youssef's comments were made. A table read with the cast was held on February 22, and Gunn revealed that Terence Rosemore was portraying Luthor's henchman Otis Berg after having small roles in some of Gunn's prior films. Zaslav said filming would begin the following week, when Gunn announced that he had shortened the film's title to Superman. He had come to feel while writing the film that it was about looking forward while the Legacy subtitle was about looking backward.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began on February 29, 2024, which is Superman's birthday in the comic books. Filming took place in the Adventdalen valley in Svalbard, Norway, for one week to shoot scenes featuring the Fortress of Solitude. Gunn chose Svalbard for its natural beauty, landscapes, and similarities to Antarctica, where the Fortress is located. Filming occurred under the working title Genesis. Henry Braham returned as cinematographer from the later two Guardians of the Galaxy films, The Suicide Squad, and The Flash. The entire film was shot using IMAX certified Red Digital Cinema cameras. Filming was delayed from an initial January 2024 start by the SAG-AFTRA strike, and was expected to last around four months. Effects studio Legacy Effects worked on the film's practical effects, contributing character designs, prosthetic makeup, specialty suits, and animatronics.\n\nWendell Pierce was cast as Perry White at the start of March. Filming at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, had begun by March 8 and was expected to last until August 2. Filming in Cleveland and Cincinnati was set to take 37 days between April 1 and August 23. Filming was also expected to take place in Macon, Georgia. In April, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Neva Howell were cast as Jonathan and Martha Kent in April, while Beck Bennett, Mikaela Hoover, and newcomer Christopher McDonald were cast as Daily Planet employees Steve Lombard, Cat Grant, and Ron Troupe in June. Hoover previously appeared in several of Gunn's films. Corenswet and Brosnahan filmed a 12-minute interview scene together, which Gunn described as ten percent of the film shot in two days, and highlighted their chemistry as \"palpable\". The 1940 film His Girl Friday was a major reference for depicting their relationship as \"equal match[es]\" for each other with a \"longing romance\" and witty comedy inspired by the works of Preston Sturges. Characters from the animated DCU series Creature Commandos (2024–present) were expected to appear in the film, and Gunn and Safran intended for the same actors to portray characters across animation and live-action in the DCU; set photos revealed that Frank Grillo was reprising his role as Rick Flag Sr. from that series.\nThe production moved to Northeast Ohio on June 14, when filming took place at the Headlands Beach State Park in Mentor, Ohio. Six weeks of filming took place throughout Cleveland, beginning in downtown Cleveland on June 24. Filming locations included Ontario Street, the Cleveland Greyhound Station, Public Square, the Detroit–Superior Bridge, PNC Plaza, Progressive Field, and Cleveland Arcade. Exterior shots of the Huntington Bank Building, Key Tower, and the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument were filmed in Public Square. The exterior of the Leader Building stood in for the headquarters of the Daily Planet, and Key Tower was used as the headquarters for Stagg Enterprises. Filming in Cleveland was completed on July 16, when Gunn said there were a couple weeks left of shooting. The production moved to Cincinnati by July 18, taking place at the Cincinnati Museum Center in Union Terminal and in the Lytle Tunnel. Filming wrapped on July 30.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn August 2024, Sean Gunn confirmed his casting as Maxwell Lord for the film. The following month, Alan Tudyk was revealed to have a role in the film after voicing several characters in Creature Commandos; Tudyk voices the Superman robot \"Four\". Waid revealed that Krypto was appearing in the film, which Gunn officially confirmed in October. He explained that the character's portrayal was inspired by his dog Ozu, who was adopted soon after Gunn began writing Superman, and said Ozu was at first \"problematic to say the least... I remember thinking, 'Gosh, how difficult would life be if Ozu had superpowers?'—and thus Krypto came into the script and changed the shape of the story\".\n\nGunn began test screening the film by the start of December. A day-and-a-half of individual pick-up shots were scheduled to take place in Los Angeles shortly after, which Gunn said was to \"enhance the film\" rather than reshoot any scenes. Alcock was confirmed to be appearing in the film in January 2025. Three days of pick-ups had also taken place in Atlanta by the end of May, and Gunn said the film was completed and received a picture lock on June 5. Later that month, Michael Rooker and Klementieff were confirmed to have voiced two Superman robots alongside Cooper and Angela Sarafyan as Superman's Kryptonian parents Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van. William Hoy and Craig Alpert co-edited the film, after they respectively worked on the DC films The Batman and Blue Beetle (2023).\nMuch of the visual effects team from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 returned to work with Gunn on Superman, including visual effects supervisor Stéphane Ceretti. Visual effects were provided by Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), and Wētā FX.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nIn December 2023, Gunn said most of the film's score and major themes had been written, but the composer had not been announced because their deal had not been finalized. In February 2024, he announced that John Murphy was composing the score after doing so for The Suicide Squad, The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022), and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. In December, Gunn confirmed that Murphy was using a new version of John Williams's \"Superman March\" theme from the 1978 Superman film. Gunn considered Williams's score to be one of the greatest of all time and had associated his theme with Superman from the start of the film's development. He saw the theme's inclusion as one way for the film to harken back to past iterations. Unlike other projects by Gunn, Superman only features two licensed songs; \"Punkrocker\" by Teddybears & Iggy Pop, and \"5 Years Time\" by Noah and the Whale. In April 2025, David Fleming was revealed to be contributing some music and sharing credit for the score with Murphy. On the soundtrack, Safran's daughter Lou Lou performs \"The Mighty Crabjoys Theme\" with the American rock band Foxy Shazam, with Lou Lou and the band's member Eric Nally on vocals, and written by Gunn and Nally.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\n\nFor the January 2023 announcement, Gunn used the cover art of All-Star Superman's first issue to represent the film. He also posted the cover on social media in March when confirming that he would direct the film. Gunn marked the beginning of filming in February 2024 by posting a picture of Superman's logo, which commentators noted for its visual similarity to the character's costume in the Kingdom Come comic book, albeit with the classic yellow and red color scheme. Safran promoted the film on-stage during Warner Bros.'s CinemaCon presentation in April, with Gunn, Corenswet, and Brosnahan appearing via video messages. The panel unveiled a full look at the Superman emblem and Gunn said he planned to attend the following year's event in-person with the cast to initiate a \"Summer of Superman\". Gunn released a first-look image of Corenswet in costume in early May, which depicts Superman suiting up while an alien-looking threat attacks in the background. Commentary on the image focused on the return of red briefs, which were not included in the Man of Steel design. Elements of the costume were also compared to Jim Lee's design used in DC Comics's 2011 New 52 initiative. The character's pose and the attack in the background led to speculation about Superman's characterization in the film and what threats he may face. A display inspired by the film's Fortress of Solitude was included at Warner Bros.'s Licensing Expo booth in Las Vegas later in May.\nGunn released the first image of Krypto, alongside Corenswet's Superman, in October 2024 in honor of \"Adopt a Shelter Dog\" month. A motion poster was released on December 16 featuring a slowed-down rendition of John Williams's \"Superman March\" with an electric guitar opening. Jordan Moreau at Variety described the poster as an homage to Christopher Reeve's portrayal of Superman in the 1978 film but with quieter, \"more thoughtful\" music. A teaser trailer was shown at a press screening that day ahead of a public release on December 19. The trailer had over 250 million global views in its first 24 hours, making it the most-viewed and discussed trailer for a DC Comics or Warner Bros. film in that time period. WaterTower Music released Murphy's music for the trailer as a single, titled \"Theme from Superman (Trailer Version)\", later that day. Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl XXI on Super Bowl Sunday in February 2025 was co-sponsored by the film, with Gunn and Ozu appearing to introduce new footage. A \"Krypto Super Play\" award was presented to one of the puppies participating in the game. At the end of the month, DC Studios hired Ricky Strauss, a former marketing executive at Apple TV+ and Disney, to consult on the film's marketing following the exit of Warner Bros. global marketing chief Josh Goldstine the prior month. Safran said Zaslav had \"rallied the entire company\" behind the film in a similar way to previous successful Warner Bros. films such as Barbie (2023).\nGunn, Corenswet, Brosnahan, and Hoult promoted the film during Warner Bros.'s CinemaCon panel in April 2025, where an extended sequence and new behind-the-scenes footage were shown. The extended footage was later released online and shown before IMAX screenings for the Warner Bros. film A Minecraft Movie, while the behind-the-scenes footage was released on April 18 to coincide with the anniversary of Superman's debut in Action Comics #1 (1938). Commentators highlighted the focus on Krypto and his relationship with Superman in the extended footage, and the behind-the-scenes footage's emphasis on Superman's hopefulness alongside the elaborate sets and costumes.\nAn official trailer was released on May 14, which Ray Flook at Bleeding Cool called a \"banger\", highlighting its action, humor, and supporting DC characters. He said the trailer proved that Superman was \"in the right hands\" with Gunn's interpretation and that it was \"definitely the Superman we need in our lives, now more than ever\". IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole highlighted Kent and Lane's relationship, and felt the trailer's interview highlighted the ethics of Superman's intervention in a foreign war, which Polygon's Michael McWhertor also commented upon, noting that the trailer questioned if Superman's actions represented American values. A prequel junior novel, Superman: Welcome to Metropolis, was released in early June, and explores the early career of Clark and Lois at the Daily Planet, the Justice Gang members, and features the character Metallo. A final trailer was released on June 11, one month before the film's release. Germain Lussier of Gizmodo called it the \"most revealing trailer to date\" and highlighted the trailer's visual effects and action sequences and its depiction of Luthor's hatred for Superman. Total Film's George Marston speculated that Superman would be working both with and against the Justice Gang based on scenes of him collaborating with Mister Terrific and Gardner being at \"odds with Superman\", while Ernesto Valenzuela from MovieWeb felt Luthor's initial monologue being \"superseded\" by Superman's \"optimism\" was a \"brilliant way to construct this trailer\".\n\nThe first 30 minutes of the film were shown at CineEurope in Barcelona on June 17, and in Manila on June 19, as the start of the \"Superman World Tour\", which took place in seven major international cities leading up to the film's release. Veda Luna Zabala at Nylon Manila described the footage as \"fun, colorful, and hopeful\", and highlighted Hoult's performance. An 11 feet (3.4 m) tall Superman statue modeled after Corenswet was suspended at the top of the Shard in London on July 1, encouraging pedestrians to \"Look Up\". This was the highest public sculpture put on display in the United Kingdom, and it took four months to be crafted. 25 pop-up Daily Planet newsstand kiosks were also installed at multiple locations throughout London. Warner Bros. hosted a fan event for Superman on July 2, at Cineworld Leicester Square in London. The film partnered with Fandango and Amazon Prime for early access theatrical screenings on July 8, which became Fandango's best-selling first-day presale tickets for that year, surpassing the general presale tickets for Marvel's The Fantastic Four: First Steps, also releasing that month. The Lola Cars Formula E team ran a special livery based on the film for the 2025 Berlin ePrix. Funko and McFarlane Toys are set to release action figures based on the film. The Hollywood Reporter reported that DC Studios and Warner Bros. could spend approximately $200 million on marketing for a total cost around $400 million with the production budget, though Variety reported that marketing cost $125 million.\nLeading up to the film's release and amid the mass deportations during the second presidency of U.S. president Donald Trump, Gunn said that \"Superman is the story of America\" and \"an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.\" This received backlash from some supporters of Trump and members of the MAGA movement, with some pundits on Fox News calling the film \"Superwoke\", but Gunn responded that Superman was for \"everyone\", explaining that it was \"about kindness and I think that's something everyone can relate to\".\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nSuperman premiered at the TCL Chinese Theater on July 7, 2025, and was released theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally on July 9, and in the United States and China on July 11, in IMAX, RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, ScreenX, and 4DX.\nIn January 2025, the estate of Superman co-creator Joe Shuster filed a lawsuit against WBD, asserting that the rights to distribute the film in some international territories had reverted to them based on different copyright laws: the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia in 2017, and Canada in 2021. Two months later, WBD filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, citing prior copyright lawsuits being rejected, and it was dismissed in April, due to a lack of jurisdiction. The lawsuit was refiled with the New York Supreme Court a month later, with an injunction requested, but the motion was denied in early June.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was released for digital download on August 15, 2025, and will be released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 23. The home media releases include deleted scenes, a making-of documentary, a commentary by Gunn, and various featurettes. Gunn said Superman was released early on digital platforms to allow people to watch the film before the second season of Peacemaker which has links to the film.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of September 2, 2025, Superman has grossed $352 million in the United States and Canada, and $260 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $612 million.\nAt the start of June 2025, TheWrap estimated that Superman needed to gross more than $500 million worldwide to become profitable at the box office, but that it would need to earn around $700 million to be considered a success. The Hollywood Reporter estimated that the film could have a domestic opening weekend of around $175 million and a potential global total of over $1 billion, based on the first full trailer's engagement metrics, while noting its production and marketing costs accounted for a total of around $400 million. Three weeks ahead of the film's release, Superman was projected to earn $125–145 million or approximately $135 million in its domestic opening weekend, which would be higher than the debut of Man of Steel ($116 million). DC Studios and Warner Bros. estimated a more conservative debut of $90–125 million, while the potential $175 million debut remained projected, which would surpass the debut of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ($166 million) as the biggest opening for a DC film. In the week of release, Deadline Hollywood projected the film's domestic opening gross to be around $115–130 million.\nOn July 10, Deadline Hollywood reported the film earned $2.8 million from Tuesday previews for an estimated total $21 million including Thursday previews. Final Thursday previews would see the film make $22.5 million, when counting both theatrical and Tuesday Amazon Prime screenings ($2.8 million). This was, at the time, the best preview box office for any film released in the year 2025 before The Fantastic Four: First Steps surpassed it two weeks later, as well as a record for any film involving James Gunn. This was also higher than the previous preview box office record Warner Bros. achieved with Barbie. The film was now projected to make $115–$121 million at the domestic box office during its opening weekend, and over $210 million worldwide during this time as well. The film made $56.5 million on its first day, the second-highest of 2025, behind A Minecraft Movie. It ended up debuting to $125 million, finishing atop the box office, and becoming the biggest opening weekend for a standalone Superman film ahead of Man of Steel (2013) which opened to $116.6 million, as well as the second-biggest opening weekend for a film featuring Superman, behind Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ($166 million in 2016). It also scored the third-highest opening weekend for a 2025 film, behind A Minecraft Movie and Lilo & Stitch. In its second weekend, the film remained in first place, grossing $57 million. This marked a 54% drop, which was deemed better than other superhero films of 2025 up until that point, such as Captain America: Brave New World (68%) and Thunderbolts* (56%), attributed to positive word-of-mouth, with Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian pointing out that the film's second-weekend drop is \"indicative of a marketplace that's embracing the film\". In its third weekend, the film was dethroned by newcomer The Fantastic Four: First Steps, finishing second, earning $24.9 million, a 57% drop. By the end of July, Superman became the first DC film since The Batman (2022) to earn over $300 million domestically, and in late August, it became the first DC film, also since The Batman, to earn $600 million globally.\nIn its opening weekend, the film made an estimated $95 million from international markets, for a total gross of $220 million. The film's highest-grossing territories include the United Kingdom ($9.8 million), Mexico ($8.8 million), China ($6.6 million), Brazil ($5.9 million), Australia ($5.3 million), France ($4.2 million), Korea ($4.2 million), India ($3.8 million), Spain ($2.9 million) and Japan ($2.5 million). Its perceived underperformance outside of the United States and Canada, particularly in markets like China, where it debuted in fourth place, was partially attributed to the character's American patriotic roots, with David A. Gross from the FranchiseRe movie consulting firm stating \"Superman has always been identified as a quintessentially American character and story, and in some parts of the world, America is currently not enjoying its greatest popularity\".\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 483 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Pulling off the heroic feat of fleshing out a dynamic new world while putting its champion's big, beating heart front and center, this Superman flies high as a Man of Tomorrow grounded in the here and now.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 58 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Critics found the film to be fun, colorful, and earnest, although some felt it was overstuffed with characters and ideas. The performances of Corenswet, Brosnahan, and Hoult were praised. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as Man of Steel. Those surveyed by PostTrak gave it an 86% positive score and 74% said they would definitely recommend it.\nIGN rated the film 8/10, calling it \"wonderfully entertaining and heartfelt\". Scott Phillips of Forbes praised its colorful visuals, humor and lighthearted tone. Trace Sauveur of AwardsWatch welcomed its no‑origin‑story, no‑crossover approach. Jake Cole of Slant Magazine argued the character endures because he transcends passing trends. Cody Dericks of Next Best Picture felt the casting is as pitch‑perfect as Christopher Reeve's was decades ago. Writing for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review, stating that it \"delivers a Superman deeply in touch with his humanity, and perfectly representative of the essence of the character.\"\nLiz Shannon Miller of Consequence called it: \"A movie that doesn't sacrifice its titular character in service to franchise-building. Instead, it focuses on celebrating the values that Superman himself has embodied from the beginning.\" William Bibbiani of TheWrap wrote: \"James Gunn tried to make a great Superman movie, one that embraces the wonder of the character as an action hero and a moral paragon, which derives its drama from how people react to his faith in us. He succeeded.\" Nicholas Barber at BBC Culture gave the film three stars out of five, and wrote: \"It takes some gall to make a zillion-dollar Hollywood blockbuster that feels so much like an eccentric sci-fi B-movie.\" Alissa Wilkinson of The New York Times called it a goofy yet charming take and compared it to Iron Man (2008). Variety's Owen Gleiberman praised the performances and gave it a positive review. David Crow of Den of Geek said the film achieves \"true grace\" when it narrows its focus to Lois and Clark.\nAmong more negative reviews, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two stars out of five, criticizing its \"pointless, cluttered backstory\" and \"yet another CGI city‑leveling finale\". In a 2 out of 5 review for Empire, Sophie Butcher described it as \"bold and bright and full of color and cosmic invention\" but added that \"the final act sinks into CGI chaos, with an unsatisfying climax, an eye-roll-inducing reveal, a restlessly intermittent tone, and an insistence on prioritizing things and people we don't really care about over core characters.\" Erik Kain gave the film two out of five for Forbes, writing that the \"massive\" cast finds itself in an \"overstuffed, badly-paced plot\" and that \"the story moves from one action sequence to the next, racing forward at a breakneck pace that leaves little room for character development.\" Mark Kermode described the film as \"tonally all over the place\" and \"messy\", but that the film was \"unexpectedly good fun\" and overall enjoyable.\nThe film features a war between the fictional nations of Boravia—an aggressor backed by Luthor and the United States—and its neighbor Jarhanpur, which some critics argue mirrors the real-world dynamics of the Israel–Palestine conflict, particularly the Gaza war that began in 2023. Gunn has maintained that the script predated the conflict and was not intended as an allegory.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nSuperman was nominated for Most Anticipated Film at the 8th Astra Midseason Movie Awards. The trailer \"Fight\" was nominated for Best Summer 2025 Blockbuster Trailer at the 2025 Golden Trailer Awards.\n\n\n== Future ==\nIn June 2025, Gunn said he had begun writing a follow-up to Superman that would not be a direct sequel, but would feature Superman in a major role. Corenswet and Brosnahan had options for a potential sequel, but following Superman's release in July, a direct sequel was not expected to be imminently announced. In August, Zaslav confirmed that Gunn was writing and directing the next film in the \"Super-Family\", which Gunn said he had finished writing a script treatment for. He described it as the next story in the \"Superman Saga\" and hoped to begin production soon. In September, Gunn announced that the film was titled Man of Tomorrow and that it was given a release date of July 9, 2027. Corenswet and Hoult were both expected to return.\nAlso in July 2025, Gunn was reported to be considering spin-off television series based on supporting characters from the film, such as Gathegi's Mister Terrific and Gisondo's Jimmy Olsen. Journalist Jeff Sneider reported that Gisondo was expected to star in a Jimmy Olsen series for the streaming service HBO Max, which would introduce the comic book villain Gorilla Grodd to the DCU.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nSuperman at IMDb \n\n]",

        "title": "Fuck",
        "content": "Fuck () is profanity in the English language that often refers to the act of sexual intercourse, but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to convey disdain. While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475. In modern usage, the term fuck and its derivatives (such as fucker and fucking) are used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an infix, an interjection or an adverb. There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as motherfucker and fuck off.\n\n\n== Offensiveness ==\nIt is unclear whether the word has always been considered a pejorative or, if not, when it first came to be used to describe (often in an extremely angry, hostile, or belligerent manner) unpleasant circumstances or people in an intentionally offensive way, such as in the term motherfucker, one of its more common usages in some parts of the English-speaking world. Some English-speaking countries censor it on television and radio. Andrea Millwood Hargrave's 2000 study of the attitudes of the British public found that fuck was considered the third-most-severe profanity, and its derivative motherfucker second. Cunt was considered the most severe.\nNevertheless, the word has increasingly become less of a pejorative and more publicly acceptable, an example of the \"dysphemism treadmill\" or semantic drift known as melioration, wherein former pejoratives become inoffensive and commonplace. Because of its increasing usage in the public forum, in 2005 the word was included for the first time as one of three vulgarities in The Canadian Press's Canadian Press Caps and Spelling guide. Journalists were advised to refrain from censoring the word but use it sparingly and only when its inclusion was essential to the story. According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, \"notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage.\" Hobbs considers users rather than usage of the word and sub-divides users into \"non-users\", for whom \"the word belongs to a set of taboo words, the very utterance of which constitutes an affront, and any use of the word, regardless of its form (verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) or meaning (literal or metaphorical) evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo\"; and \"users\", for whom \"metaphorical uses of the word fuck no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than does a ten-year-old's 'My mom'll kill me if she finds out' evokes images of murder\" so that the \"criteria of taboo are missing.\"\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\n=== Germanic cognates ===\nThe Oxford English Dictionary states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is \"probably cognate\" with a number of Germanic words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the Old French word that meant 'to have sex'.\nThe word has probable cognates in other Germanic languages, such as German ficken ('to fuck'); Dutch fokken ('to breed', 'to beget'); Afrikaans fok ('to fuck'); Icelandic fokka ('to mess around', 'to rush'); dialectal Norwegian fukka ('to copulate'); and dialectal Swedish focka ('to strike', 'to copulate') and fock ('penis'). This points to a possible etymology where Common Germanic *fuk(k)ōn-from the verbal root *fug- ('to blow') comes from an Indo-European root *peuk-, or *peuĝ- ('to strike'), cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin pugno ('I fight') or pugnus ('fist'). By application of Grimm's law, this hypothetical root also has the Pre-Germanic form *pug-néh2- ('to blow'), which is the etymon of, amongst others, Dutch fok(zeil) ('foresail'). There is a theory that fuck is most likely derived from German or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root.\n\n\n=== False etymologies ===\nOne reason that the word fuck is difficult to trace etymologically is that it was used far more extensively in common speech, rather than in easily traceable documents or writings. There exist multiple urban legends that advance false etymologies, including the word allegedly being an acronym. One of these urban legends is that the word fuck originated in Irish law. If a couple was caught committing adultery, the two would be punished \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge In the Nude\", with \"FUCKIN\" written on the stocks above to denote the crime. A variant of this legend alleges church clerks to have recorded the crime of \"Forbidden Use of Carnal Knowledge\". Another legend places the origin on a  royal permission allegedly granted during the Middle Ages. Due to the Black Death and the consequent scarcity of resources, villages and towns supposedly attempted to control population growth by requiring permission to engage in intercourse. Royal permission (usually from a local magistrate or lord) is said to have required placing a sign visible from the road reading: \"Fornicating/Fornication Under Consent of King\", later shortened to FUCK. This story is not supported by written evidence, and has been proven false, but has persisted in oral and literary traditions for many years.\nAnother legendary etymology, first made popular by the American radio show Car Talk, says that the phrase fuck you derives from pluck yew in connection with a misconception regarding the origins of the V sign. This misconception states that English archers believed that those who were captured by the French had their index and middle fingers cut off so that they could no longer operate their longbows, and that the V sign was used by uncaptured and victorious archers in a display of defiance against the French. The addition of the phrase fuck you to the misconception came when it was claimed that the English yelled that they could still pluck yew, (yew wood being the preferred material for longbows at the time), a phrase that evolved into the modern fuck you. In any event, the word fuck has been in use far too long for some of these supposed origins to be possible. Since no such acronym was ever recorded before the 1960s according to the lexicographical work The F-Word, such claims create at best a so-called \"backronym\".\n\n\n== Grammar ==\nIn terms of its parts of speech, fuck has a very flexible role in English grammar, functioning as both a transitive and intransitive verb, and as an adjective, adverb, noun, and interjection.\n\nAlthough the word itself is used in its literal sense to refer to sexual intercourse, its most common usage is figurative—to indicate the speaker's strong sentiment and to offend or shock the listener. Linguist Geoffrey Hughes found eight distinct usages for English curse words, and fuck can apply to each. For example, it fits in the \"curse\" sense (fuck you!), as well as the \"personal\" sense (You fucker). In the Oxford English Dictionary, more than a hundred different senses, usages and collocations (like fuck around, fuck with s.o., fuck you, fuck me, fuck it) are identified for fuck, its derived forms (like fucker, fuckee, fuckability), and compounds with fuck (e.g. fuckfest, fuckhole, fuckface).\n\n\n== Early usage ==\nIn 2015, Paul Booth argued he had found \"(possibly) the earliest known use of the word 'fuck' that clearly has a sexual connotation\": in English court records of 1310–11, a man local to Chester is referred to as \"Roger Fuckebythenavele\", probably a nickname. \"Either this refers to an inexperienced copulator, referring to someone trying to have sex with the navel, or it's a rather extravagant explanation for a dimwit, someone so stupid they think that this is the way to have sex\", says Booth. An earlier name, that of John le Fucker recorded in 1278, has been the subject of debate, but is thought by many philologists to have had some separate and non-sexual origin.\nOtherwise, the usually accepted first known occurrence of the word is found in code in a poem in a mixture of Latin and English composed in the 15th century. The poem, which satirizes the Carmelite friars of Cambridge, England, takes its title, \"Flen flyys\", from the first words of its opening line, Flen, flyys, and freris ('Fleas, flies, and friars'). The line that contains fuck reads Non sunt in coeli, quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk. Deciphering the phrase gxddbou xxkxzt pg ifmk, here by replacing each letter by the previous letter in alphabetical order, as the English alphabet was then, yields the macaronic non sunt in coeli, quia fuccant vvivys of heli, which translated means, 'They are not in heaven, because they fuck the women of Ely'. The phrase was probably encoded because it accused monks of breaking their vows of celibacy; it is uncertain to what extent the word fuck was considered acceptable at the time. The stem of fuccant is an English word used as Latin. In the Middle English of this poem, the term wife was still used generically for 'woman'.\nWilliam Dunbar's 1503 poem \"Brash of Wowing\" includes the lines: \"Yit be his feiris he wald haue fukkit: / Ye brek my hairt, my bony ane\" (ll. 13–14).\nThe oldest known occurrence of the word in adjectival form (which implies use of the verb) in English comes from the margins of a 1528 manuscript copy of Cicero's De Officiis. A monk had scrawled in the margin notes, \"fuckin Abbot\". Whether the monk meant the word literally, to accuse this abbot of \"questionable monastic morals\", or whether he used it \"as an intensifier, to convey his extreme dismay\" is unclear.\nJohn Florio's 1598 Italian–English dictionary, A Worlde of Wordes, included the term, along with several now-archaic, but then-vulgar synonyms, in this definition:\n\nFottere: To jape, to sard, to fucke, to swive, to occupy.\nOf these, \"occupy\" and \"jape\" still survive as verbs, though with less profane meanings, while \"sard\" was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon verb seordan (or seorðan, ON serða), to copulate; and \"swive\" had derived from earlier swīfan, to revolve i.e. to swivel (compare modern-day \"screw\"). As late as the 18th century, the verb occupy was seldom used in print because it carried sexual overtones.\nA 1790 poem by St. George Tucker has a father upset with his bookish son say \"I'd not give [a fuck] for all you've read\". Originally printed as \"I'd not give ------ for all you've read\", scholars agree that the words a fuck were removed, making the poem the first recorded instance of the now-common phrase I don't give a fuck.\nFarmer and Henley's 1893 dictionary of slang notes both the adverbial and adjectival forms of fuck as similar to but \"more violent\" than bloody and indicating extreme insult, respectively.\nAccording to an article in the journal  Science, research shows that when humans switched to processed foods after the spread of agriculture, they put less wear and tear on their teeth, leading to an overbite in adults. This overbite is said to make it easier to produce \"f\" and \"v\" sounds, and humorously, cleared the way for words like \"Fuck\".\n\n\n== Modern usage ==\nThe modern usage and flexibility of fuck was established by the mid-to-late 19th century, and has been fairly stable since. Most literally, to fuck is to have sex, but it is also used as a more general expletive or intensifier.\nInsertion of the trochaic word fucking can also be used as an exercise for diagnosing the cadence of an English-language word. This is the use of fuck or more specifically fucking as an infix, or more properly, a tmesis (see expletive infixation). For example, the word in-fucking-credible sounds acceptable to the English ear, and is in fairly common use, while *incred-fucking-ible would sound very clumsy (though, depending on the context, this might be perceived as a humorous improvisation of the word). Abso-fucking-lutely and motherfucking are also common uses of fuck as an affix. While neither dysphemistic nor connected to the sexual connotations of the word, even the vacuous usages are considered offensive and gratuitous, such as This is fucking awesome! Fuck has colloquial usage as a verb, adverb, adjective, conjunction, interjection, noun, and pronoun.\n\nThe word fuck is a component of many acronyms, some of which—like SNAFU (Situation Normal: All Fucked Up) and FUBAR (Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition)—date as far back as World War II. MILF (Mother I'd Like to Fuck) and variations of the first letter are widely seen in pornographic contexts. Many more recent coinages, such as the shorthand WTF? for 'what the fuck', STFU for 'shut the fuck up', or FML for 'fuck my life', have been widely extant on the Internet, and may count as examples of internet memes. Many acronyms will also have an F or MF added to increase emphasis; for example, OMG ('oh my God') becomes OMFG ('oh my fucking God'). Abbreviations involving fuck can be considered less offensive than fuck itself. Although the word is proclaimed vulgar, several comedians rely on fuck for comedic routines. George Carlin created several literary works based upon the word, including his routine \"seven dirty words\"—words that were bleep censored on US television.\n\"Fuck all\" is a widely recognised expression meaning \"None, or very little\".\n\n\n=== Examples of more recent usage ===\nIn 1928, English writer D. H. Lawrence's novel Lady Chatterley's Lover gained notoriety for its frequent use of the words fuck and fucking. The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger featured the use of fuck you in print. First published in the United States in 1951, the novel remains controversial to this day due in part to its use of the word, standing at number 13 for the most banned books from 1990 to 2000 according to the American Library Association.\nActress Miriam Margolyes has claimed that she was the first to unintentionally say the word on the quiz show University Challenge in 1963; representing Newnham College, Cambridge. She claims to have uttered the word in frustration over an incorrect answer. The word was \"bleeped out\" for transmission. However, the first documented deliberate use of the word fuck on live British television has been attributed to theatre critic Kenneth Tynan in 1965, though it has been claimed Irish playwright Brendan Behan used the word on Panorama in 1956 or the man who painted the railings on Stranmillis Embankment alongside the River Lagan in Belfast, who in 1959 told Ulster TV's teatime magazine programme Roundabout that his job was \"fucking boring\". \nThe Bill Grundy incident was a controversy that ensued in 1976 when Today host Bill Grundy interviewed the Sex Pistols, after guitarist Steve Jones called Grundy a \"dirty fucker\" and a \"fucking rotter\".\nThe word began to break into cinema when it was uttered once in the film Vapor (1963) and in two Andy Warhol films – Poor Little Rich Girl (1965) and My Hustler (1965), and later in each of two 1967 British releases, Ulysses and I'll Never Forget What's'isname. It was used several times in the 1969 British film Bronco Bullfrog. According to director Robert Altman, the first time the word fuck was used in a major American studio film was in 1970's M*A*S*H, spoken by Painless during the football match at the end of the film.\nEarly examples of the word \"fuck\" featuring in music, although adlibbed in the studio rather than being a true part of the lyrics, include drummer Lynn Easton's exclamation 55 seconds into the Kingsmen's \"Louie Louie\" (1963), or the discrete \"fucking hell\" buried in the mix of the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" (1968). MC5 and Jefferson Airplane both used the term \"motherfuckers\" on their respective 1969 songs \"Kick Out the Jams\" (from MC5's live album of the same name) and \"We Can Be Together\" (from Volunteers). Elektra Records created a request clean version of Kick Out the Jams for those offended by the MC5's usage, whereas RCA Records initially refused to release Volunteers uncensored until the band pointed out the label had already released the Hair cast recording with the term. Use of the term \"fuck\" was still a rare occurrence on rock records in 1976 when the band Doctors of Madness used the word in their song \"Out\". The Sex Pistols also notoriously used the term on music a year later.\n\n\n=== Use in politics ===\n\nFuck is not widely used in politics, and the use of the word by politicians often produces controversy. Some events include:\n\nIn 1965, US President Lyndon B. Johnson said to the Greek ambassador Alexandros Matsas when he objected to American plans in Cyprus, \"Fuck your parliament and your constitution. America is an elephant. Cyprus is a flea. Greece is a flea. If these two fellows continue itching the elephant they may just get whacked by the elephant's trunk, whacked good\".\nFormer British Secretary of State for Defence Denis Healey reported that the penultimate High Commissioner of Aden (1965–1967), Sir Richard Turnbull, stated that, \"When the British Empire finally sinks beneath the waves of history, it will leave behind it only two memorials: one is the game of Association Football and the other is the expression 'Fuck Off'.\"\nDuring debate in February 1971 in the House of Commons of Canada, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau mouthed the words \"fuck off\" at Conservative MP John Lundrigan, while Lundrigan made some comments about unemployment. Afterward, when asked by a television reporter what he had been thinking, Trudeau famously replied: \"What is the nature of your thoughts, gentlemen, when you say 'fuddle duddle' or something like that?\". \"Fuddle duddle\" consequently became a catchphrase in Canadian media associated with Trudeau.\nThe first accepted modern use in the British House of Commons came in 1982 when Reg Race, Labour MP for Wood Green, referred to adverts placed in local newsagents by prostitutes which read \"Phone them and fuck them.\" Hansard, the full record of debates, printed \"F*** them\", but even this euphemism was deprecated by the Speaker, George Thomas.\nDuring the George W. Bush presidency, a vehicular bumper sticker with the words Buck Fush (a spoonerism of \"Fuck Bush\") gained some popularity in the US.\nIn June 2004, US Vice President Dick Cheney told Democratic senator Patrick Leahy, \"Go fuck yourself.\" Coincidentally, Cheney's outburst occurred on the same day that the Defense of Decency Act was passed in the Senate.\nIn February 2006 Morris Iemma, Premier of the Australian state of New South Wales, while awaiting the start of a Council of Australian Governments media conference in Canberra, was chatting to Victorian Premier Steve Bracks. Not realizing microphones were recording, he said, \"Today? This fuckwit who's the new CEO of the Cross City Tunnel has ... been saying what controversy? There is no controversy.\" The exchange referred to the newly appointed CEO of the recently opened Cross City Tunnel toll road within Sydney.\nIn 2007, U.S. Senator John Cornyn objected to John McCain's perceived intrusion upon a Senate meeting on immigration, saying, \"Wait a second here. I've been sitting in here for all of these negotiations and you just parachute in here on the last day. You're out of line.\" McCain replied \"Fuck you! I know more about this than anyone else in the room.\"\nIn April 2007, New Zealand Education Minister Steve Maharey said \"fuck you\" to a fellow MP during parliamentary question time. He apologized shortly afterwards.\nIn December 2008, recorded telephone conversations revealed Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich trying to \"sell\" an appointment to the Senate seat that Barack Obama resigned after being elected president. In the phone conversation, Blagojevich said in reference to his power to appoint a new senator, \"I've got this thing and it's fucking golden and I'm just not giving it up for fuckin' nothing.\" In the recorded conversations, Blagojevich also referred to Obama as a \"motherfucker\" and repeatedly said, \"fuck him\". When speaking of the Obama administration's request that Valerie Jarrett be appointed as Obama's replacement, Blagojevich complained, \"They're not willing to give me anything except appreciation. Fuck them.\" Blagojevich also said Tribune Company ownership should be told to \"fire those fuckers\" in reference to Chicago Tribune editors critical of him.\nIn December 2009 in Dáil Éireann (the lower house of the Irish Parliament), Paul Gogarty responded to heckles from Emmet Stagg with the outburst, \"With all due respect, in the most unparliamentary language, fuck you, Deputy Stagg. Fuck you.\" Gogarty immediately withdrew the remarks and later made a personal statement of apology. Reporting of the outburst quickly spread by media and the Internet. A subcommittee of the Dáil's standing committee on procedure and privilege produced a 28-page report on the incident.\nOn March 23, 2010, US Vice President Joe Biden whispered into President Barack Obama's ear, \"This is a big fucking deal\" when referring to the US health care reform bill. His words were picked up by microphones and video.\nOn May 3, 2010, Canadian senator Nancy Ruth advised representatives of women's groups to \"shut the fuck up\" on access to abortion, in the run-up to the 36th G8 summit.\nIn late 2012, the then-US House Speaker John Boehner was visiting the White House, where he saw then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in the lobby. Boehner was under great stress about the impending fiscal cliff, and Reid had also accused him of running a \"dictatorship\" in the house. Boehner saw Harry Reid, pointed his finger at him, and told him, \"Go fuck yourself!\" Reid replied by saying, \"What are you talking about?\" Boehner then repeated what he had told him and left.\nIn late 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte reacted to the European Parliament's criticism over the prevalence of unsolved extrajudicial killings which occurred during his \"War on Drugs\" by lashing out at EU politicians, claiming that they were \"hypocrites\" whose colonial-era ancestors had killed \"thousands\" of Arabs and other peoples during the colonial period. Upon making an obscene hand gesture, Duterte stated that he told EU politicians, \"When I read the EU condemnation I told them 'fuck you.' You are only doing it to atone for your own sins\" and \"They do not want a safe Philippines. They want it to be ruled by criminals. Oh, well, I'm sorry. That is your idiotic view\". Duterte also said, in response to growing international criticism, the \"EU now has the gall to condemn me. I repeat it, fuck you.\"\nOn June 10, 2018, Robert De Niro sparked controversy during the 72nd Tony Awards as he cursed US President Donald Trump with the word during the live broadcast. He started with the sentence: \"I'm gonna say one thing: Fuck Trump.\" He clenched his two fists in the air, and ended his remarks by saying \"It's no longer down with Trump, it's fuck Trump!\" He received a standing ovation from the audience, which was mostly celebrities.\nOn August 5, 2019, Beto O'Rourke after learning of a mass shooting in his home town of El Paso, Texas stated \"He's been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. I don't know, like, members of the press, what the fuck?\" referring to Donald Trump when asked for his reaction to the shooting.\nDuring a virtual live telecast Senate hearing on August 21, 2020, Senator Tom Carper shouted: \"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!\" over a video chat that was being broadcast nationwide.\nDuring his October 9, 2020 appearance on The Rush Limbaugh Show, US President Donald Trump stated in a threat to Iran, \"If you fuck around with us, if you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you that have never been done before.\"\nIn 2021, \"Let's Go Brandon\" became a political slogan and internet meme used as a euphemism for \"Fuck Joe Biden\", the president of the United States.\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden said to the mayor of Fort Myers Beach, Florida, \"No one fucks with a Biden,\" to which Mayor Ray Murphey responded, \"Yeah, you're goddamn right.\"\nOn June 28, 2023, Wisconsin state senator La Tonya Johnson proclaimed mid session on the senate floor, \"Fuck the suburbs, because they don't know a goddamn thing about how life is in the city.\"\nOn June 24, 2025, President Donald Trump said regarding a violation of the Iran–Israel war ceasefire, \"We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing\".\n\n\n=== Use in marketing ===\nIn April 1997, clothing retailer French Connection began branding their clothes with fcuk (usually written in lowercase), stating it was an acronym for \"French Connection United Kingdom\". Its similarity to the word fuck caused controversy. French Connection produced a range of T-shirts with messages such as \"fcuk this\", \"hot as fcuk\", \"cool as fcuk\", \"fcuk fashion\", etc. \nIn 2009, the European Union's OHIM trade marks agency disallowed a German brewery to market a beer called \"Fucking Hell\". The brewery sued, and on March 26, 2010 got permission to market the beer. The company argued that it was actually named after the Austrian village of Fucking (now spelled Fugging) and the German term for light beer, hell (which is simply the word for \"light-coloured\").\nIancu v. Brunetti is a United States Supreme Court case in which the owner of the clothing brand FUCT (supposedly standing for \"Friends U Can't Trust\") sued the Patent and Trademark Office, which refused to trademark the name for being \"scandalous\" under the Lanham Act. The Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that a provision in 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a) of the Act, denying registration to any trademarks seen as consisting of immoral or scandalous matter, was an unconstitutional restriction of applicants' freedom of speech.\n\n\n=== Band names ===\nThe word fuck has been used in a number of band names, such as Fucked Up, generally based on common compounds. Many of these bands fall into the genres of punk and metal, while some fall into the categories of electronic rock and pop, such as Holy Fuck and Fuck Buttons\n\n\n=== F-bomb ===\nThe phrase dropping an F-bomb usually refers to the unanticipated use of the word fuck in an unexpected setting, such as public media, a play on the nickname for the hydrogen bomb (the \"H-bomb\") and the shock value that using the word fuck in discourse carries. The term was first reported in a newspaper (Newsday) in 1988 when Hall of Fame baseball catcher Gary Carter used it. In 2012 it was listed, for the first time, in the mainstream Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.\n\n\n== Censorship ==\nIn the United States, the word is frequently edited out of music and films when broadcast on TV, such as in the film The Big Lebowski, when John Goodman's character repeatedly yells, \"This is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass\". It was censored on television as \"This is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps.\"\nStill, in 1971, the US Supreme Court decided that the public display of fuck is protected under the First and Fourteenth amendments and cannot be made a criminal offense. In 1968, Paul Robert Cohen had been convicted of disturbing the peace for wearing a jacket with the slogan \"Fuck the Draft\" (in a reference to conscription in the Vietnam War). The conviction was upheld by the court of appeals and overturned by the Supreme Court in Cohen v. California.\n\n\n== Common alternatives ==\n\nIn conversation or writing, reference to or use of the word fuck may be replaced by any of many alternative words or phrases, including the F-word or the F-bomb (a play on A-bomb and H-bomb), or simply, eff or f (as in What the eff/F or You effing/f'ing fool). Also, there are many commonly used substitutes, such as flipping, frigging, fricking, freaking, feck, fudge, flaming, forget or any of a number of similar-sounding nonsense words. In print, there are alternatives such as, F***, F––k, etc.; or a string of non-alphanumeric characters, for example, @$#*%! and similar (especially favored in comic books).\nA replacement word that was used mainly on Usenet newsgroups is fsck, derived from the name of the Unix file system checking utility.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArmy creole\nFour-letter word\nHarcourt interpolation\nList of common false etymologies of English words § Profanity\nList of films that most frequently use the word fuck\nMadonna on the Late Show with David Letterman in 1994\nProfanity\nRussian warship, go fuck yourself\nSeven dirty words\nSexual slang\nThe finger (aka the middle finger), a related hand gesture\nThe Pope Song\nShit\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Dictionaries ===\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "title": ".xxx",
        "content": ".xxx (pronounced \"dot triple-ecks\" or \"dot ecks ecks ecks\") is a sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) intended as a voluntary option for pornographic sites on the Internet. The sponsoring organization is the International Foundation for Online Responsibility (IFFOR). The registry is operated by ICM Registry LLC. The ICANN Board voted to approve the sTLD on 18 March 2011. It went into operation on 15 April 2011.\nThe TLD entered its sunrise period on 7 September 2011 at 16:00 UTC; the sunrise period ended 28 October 2011. Landrush period lasted from 8 November through 25 November, and general availability commenced on 6 December 2011.\n\n\n== Background ==\nA gTLD (generic top-level domain) for sexually explicit material was proposed as one tool for dealing with the conflict between those who wish to provide and access such material through the Internet, and those who wish to prevent access to it, either by children and adolescents, or by employees at their workplaces.\nAdvocates of the idea argue that it will be easier for parents and employers to block the entire TLD, rather than using more complex and error-prone content-based filtering, without imposing any restrictions on those who wish to access it. Editors of explicit content sites, however, were afraid that the use of a single TLD like .xxx would also make it easier for search engines to block all of their content.\nCritics of the idea argue that because there is no requirement for providers of explicit content to use the TLD, sexually explicit material will still be commonplace in other domains, making it ineffectual at restricting access, and simply creating a new \"landrush\" as registrants of .com domains hosting explicit material attempt to duplicate their registrations in the .xxx domain, competing with operators who hope to register desirable names unavailable in other TLDs. There is also concern that the existence of .xxx will lead to legislation making its use mandatory for sexually explicit material, leading to legal conflicts over the definition of \"sexually explicit\", free speech rights, and jurisdiction.\nThere were also early indications that .xxx domain names will be registered not with the intent to focus on pornographic content, but to use the adult connotations as a benefit to a marketing strategy. An example is the registration of kite.xxx, which is aimed at the extreme sport of kitesurfing, thus benefiting from sexual connotations and innuendo for humor and promotional purposes.  Another example of a .xxx domain name being registered without a focus on pornographic content was the registration of popebenedict.xxx, which contained pro-Islamic content despite being named after Pope Benedict XVI.\n\n\n== Proposal by ICM Registry ==\nThe .XXX TLD was first proposed in 2000 by ICM Registry and resubmitted in 2004, but it faced strong opposition from politicians and conservative groups.\nICANN announced on 1 June 2005 a preliminary approval of .xxx as an sTLD similar to .aero, .travel, etc. ICM said it would charge $60/year for domains.  In December 2005, discussions about the implementation of .xxx were taken off the agenda of ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), placing its future in doubt. In its March 2006 meeting, the GAC formulated a letter of concern to the ICANN board about .xxx. On 10 May 2006, ICANN reversed the approval. On 6 January 2007, ICANN put up for public comment a revised proposal following changes to the policy of the ICM registry including the policing of any site that signs up to use the .xxx registry. On 30 March 2007, the ICANN board again rejected the .xxx proposal for the third time.\nOn 6 June 2008, in accordance with ICANN bylaws, ICM filed an application with the International Centre for Dispute Resolution for an independent review challenging ICANN's decision.  The filing became ICDR Case No. 50 117 T 00224 08, and in September 2009, a live hearing was held in Washington, DC, where both sides submitted documentary evidence and witness testimony. On 19 February 2010, the ICDR's independent review panel – consisting of Stephen M. Schwebel, Jan Paulsson and Dickran Tevrizian – issued its declaration. The panel found that the application for the \".XXX sTLD met the required sponsorship criteria\", and that \"the Board's reconsideration of that finding was not consistent with the application of neutral, objective and fair documented policy\". At the ICANN meeting in Nairobi in March 2010 the board resolved to consider \"process options\". A 45-day public comment was opened on 26 March 2010. At the Brussels ICANN meeting in June 2010, the ICANN board resolved to restart the process, including renewed due diligence and GAC consultations.\nOn 18 March 2011, ICANN's board approved the execution of the registry agreement with ICM for the .xxx sponsored top level domain. The vote was nine in favor, four against, with three abstentions.\nICM is expected to make over $200 million a year, with 3 to 5 million domain registrations, as companies are anticipated to defensively register their domains.\n\n\n== Opposition ==\n\n\n=== Manwin suits ===\nOn 16 November 2011, Manwin International, a pornography company that operates a large number of popular adult websites including YouPorn, filed a request for a second ICANN Independent Review Proceeding. In the request, Manwin asks that the .xxx delegation be voided, or, if not, put up to competition on renewal.\nOn the same day Manwin, together with adult film studio Digital Playground, filed a suit in the Central District of California against ICM alleging antitrust and competition violations. Among the claims in the suit are that ICANN provided \"no competitive process for the award of the .XXX registry contract\" and that ICM CEO Stuart Lawley \"has announced that he expects to be able (and intends) to prevent the establishment of any other (potentially competing) adult-content TLDs, including through a contractual promise by ICANN not to approve such TLDs\".\nOn 14 August 2012, Judge Philip S. Gutierrez granted in part and denied in part ICANN's motion to dismiss Manwin's claims and allowed the case against ICANN to move forward. On 10 May 2013, the case was voluntarily dismissed by the parties, likely due to private settlement.\n\n\n=== Free Speech Coalition ===\nThe Free Speech Coalition opposed the domain, arguing it would \"harm the adult entertainment business\" by inviting censorship and blocking, while raising money for ICM without considering the \"best interests of the industry\".\n\n\n== Alternative implementations ==\nStarting in 2005, there was an alternative implementation of .xxx by New.net, a private domain registration service unaffiliated with ICANN, via an alternative DNS root.\nAnother unofficial .xxx TLD was previously available through the alternative DNS root system administered by the now-defunct AlterNIC.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRhett Pardon (16 November 2011). \"Manwin, Digital Playground File Suit Against ICM, ICANN\".

        "title": "The Fantastic Four: First Steps",
        "content": "The Fantastic Four: First Steps is a 2025 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Fantastic Four. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 37th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the second reboot of the Fantastic Four film series. The film was directed by Matt Shakman from a screenplay by Josh Friedman, Eric Pearson, and the team of Jeff Kaplan and Ian Springer. It features an ensemble cast including Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn as the titular team, alongside Julia Garner, Sarah Niles, Mark Gatiss, Natasha Lyonne, Paul Walter Hauser, and Ralph Ineson. The film is set in the 1960s of a retro-futuristic world which the Fantastic Four must protect from the planet-devouring cosmic being Galactus (Ineson).\n20th Century Fox began work on a new Fantastic Four film following the failure of Fantastic Four (2015). After the studio was acquired by Disney in March 2019, control of the franchise was transferred to Marvel Studios, and a new film was announced that July. Jon Watts was set to direct in December 2020, but stepped down in April 2022. Shakman replaced him that September when Kaplan and Springer were working on the script. Casting began by early 2023, and Friedman joined in March to rewrite the script. The film is differentiated from previous Fantastic Four films by avoiding the team's origin story. Pearson joined to polish the script by mid-February 2024, when the main cast and the title The Fantastic Four were announced. The subtitle was added in July, when filming began. It took place until November 2024 at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location in England and Spain.\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps premiered at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles on July 21, 2025, and was released in the United States on July 25, as the first film in Phase Six of the MCU. It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $508 million worldwide, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2025 as well as the highest-grossing Fantastic Four film. A sequel is in development.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn Earth-828 in 1964, the world celebrates the fourth anniversary of astronauts Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Ben Grimm, and Johnny Storm becoming the superhero team known as the Fantastic Four after they gained superhuman abilities from exposure to cosmic rays during a space mission. Since then, the team have become celebrities and fought supervillains, while Reed's inventions have progressed technology and Sue's diplomacy via the Future Foundation has led to demilitarization and peace for much of the world. When Reed and Sue reveal that they are expecting a child, the world prepares for the new arrival and questions whether the child will also have superpowers.\nMonths later, the Silver Surfer comes to Earth and declares that it has been marked for destruction by Galactus, a planet-devouring cosmic being. Reed studies the disappearance of other planets and verifies this claim, and the team decides to return to space to stop Galactus from coming to Earth. They track the Silver Surfer's energy signature and, using faster-than-light (FTL) travel, arrive at a new planet just as it is destroyed by Galactus's ship. The team is captured and brought to Galactus, who reveals that he has an insatiable hunger that has driven him to consume planets for eons. Galactus senses that Reed and Sue's unborn child has an immense cosmic power and could take on his hunger, freeing himself from it. He offers to spare Earth in exchange for the child, and induces Sue to go into labor. The team refuses the offer and escapes from the ship. Using the gravity from a neutron star, which destroys their FTL system, the team delays the chasing Silver Surfer and propel themselves back to Earth. Sue gives birth to a boy, Franklin, on the way.\nOn their return to Earth a month later, Reed reveals the details of their encounter during a press conference. Their decision to save one child over the billions of other people on Earth leads to a public outcry, with many calling for Franklin to be sacrificed to Galactus. Johnny begins to decipher the Silver Surfer's native language using his interactions with her and some deep space transmissions Reed intercepted from her planet. They also have transmissions from planets that Galactus destroyed. As Galactus draws near and protests against the Fantastic Four escalate, Sue takes Franklin to meet with protesters. She explains that they will not sacrifice their child, but they will also not give up on the rest of humanity. Using a teleportation system that he has been working on, Reed devises a plan to build large teleportation bridges across Earth so they can transport the entire planet to another solar system where Galactus cannot reach them. Through the Future Foundation, Sue organizes the world's nations to build the bridges and conserve the energy needed to use them.\nAs the bridges are being activated, the Silver Surfer returns and begins destroying them. Johnny stops her from destroying the last bridge in Times Square and reveals what he learned from the transmissions: her name is Shalla-Bal and she became Galactus's herald to spare her world, Zenn-La. Hearing transmissions from planets she helped destroy, Shalla-Bal expresses remorse but refuses to help and flees. Using Franklin as bait, the team plans to lure Galactus to the last bridge and teleport him away. Sue negotiates with Harvey Elder to evacuate New York City's citizens to Subterranea, his underground city. Galactus makes his way through the city and captures Franklin, avoiding the trap. Sue uses all of her power to push him towards the portal with a force field while Reed rescues Franklin. Johnny attempts to sacrifice himself to give Galactus a final push into the portal, but is stopped by Shalla-Bal. She pushes Galactus into the portal herself and it closes behind them. Sue dies from her efforts, but is revived by Franklin. The team later goes on a new mission as the world celebrates their fifth anniversary.\nIn a mid-credits scene set four years later, Sue is reading to Franklin at home and goes to get a different book. She returns to see him interacting with a man in a green cloak who is holding a metal mask.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nPedro Pascal as Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic:A highly intelligent scientist and the leader of the Fantastic Four who can stretch any part of his body to great lengths. Director Matt Shakman described Reed as \"the most scientifically intelligent person\" on the planet, and a combination of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, and Robert Moses. Pascal said it was Reed's mind that was most important to him, rather than the character's physicality, and he considered \"the brilliance of an octopus\" when approaching the character. He also noted that he drew inspiration from many of the iterations of Reed from the comics, as opposed to previous portrayals of the character such as Ioan Gruffudd and Miles Teller in past Fantastic Four films, and John Krasinski in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). Shakman said that, despite the character of Reed being the hardest to cast, he found Pascal to be the best choice, in part due to having a long-standing relationship working together in film; and that it was \"fated in the stars\" to work together on First Steps.\nVanessa Kirby as Sue Storm / Invisible Woman:Reed's pregnant wife, Johnny's older sister, and a member of the Fantastic Four who can generate force fields and turn invisible. She is the founder of the Future Foundation, which has achieved global demilitarization and peace. Shakman described Sue as \"the most emotionally intelligent person\" on the planet. Kirby enjoyed synthesizing the various comic portrayals of Sue into her version of the character, focusing on motherhood as the through-line. The actress said she was obsessed with the comics run where Sue takes on the negative persona \"Malice\", and she included elements of that version in her portrayal so Sue would not be \"the stereotype of a goody, sweet mother\".\nEbon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm / The Thing:Reed's best friend, a former astronaut, and a member of the Fantastic Four whose skin has been transformed into a layer of orange rock, granting him superhuman strength and durability. Moss-Bachrach found comparisons between Ben and his character Richie Jerimovich in the series The Bear (2022–present), noting both were \"deeply loyal people\" and \"fighters with a fierce sense of code, morality, and family\". Moss-Bachrach portrays the Thing through motion capture and computer-generated imagery (CGI) rather than prosthetic makeup, and discussed that process with Mark Ruffalo, who portrays the Hulk in the MCU using the same technology. In addition to Moss-Bachrach performing his scenes in a motion-capture suit, some takes were re-filmed with the actor using different body extensions or a stand-in wearing a life-sized Thing costume to help the other actors reference the space that the character takes up. Shakman consulted scientists and studied desert rocks to find the best reference for the Thing's appearance; a specific desert rock that matched his desired look for the Thing, referred to as \"Jennifer\", was also filmed on set as a lighting reference for the visual effects team.\nJoseph Quinn as Johnny Storm / Human Torch:Sue's younger brother and a member of the Fantastic Four who can control fire and fly. While Quinn was a fan of Chris Evans's portrayal of the character in the 20th Century Fox films Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007), he did not base his portrayal on Evans's. Quinn and producer Kevin Feige discussed Johnny's womanizing in previous portrayals and concluded that this would not be considered \"sexy\" by modern audiences. Quinn wanted his version to be \"less callous with other people's feelings\" and more self-aware of his attention-seeking behavior, while still having a lot of bravado and humor. Shakman noted that Johnny is also smart and heroic, despite undercutting that with jokes.\nJulia Garner as Shalla-Bal / Silver Surfer:An alien from the utopian planet Zenn-La who agreed to become Galactus's metallic-skinned herald in exchange for him sparing her planet. She travels through space on a surfboard-like craft in search of planets for Galactus to feed on. Garner said there was a \"mysterious energy\" to the character and her relationship with Galactus. She portrayed the Silver Surfer through motion capture, combining research on surfing poses with statuesque non-surf poses from the comics to have the character \"[move] elegantly, like a dance\".\nSarah Niles as Lynne Nichols: The Chief of Staff of the Future Foundation\nMark Gatiss as Ted Gilbert: The host of a popular talk show called The Ted Gilbert Show\nNatasha Lyonne as Rachel Rozman:A school teacher and Ben's love interest. Commentators believed the character was named as a tribute to Rosalind \"Roz\" Goldstein, wife of Fantastic Four co-creator Jack Kirby.\nPaul Walter Hauser as Harvey Elder / Mole Man:A former enemy turned ally of the Fantastic Four and the human ruler of Subterranea, an underground society whose inhabitants refer to themselves as Moloids. Shakman compared Elder to a leader of a labor union with humanity and a focus on community and taking care of his people.\nRalph Ineson as Galactus:A gigantic cosmic being who consumes the life force of planets to satiate his endless hunger. Galactus is the sole survivor of a dead universe that existed before the creation of Earth-828. Shakman called him a \"humongous, 14-billion-year-old, planet-devouring cosmic vampire\". Ineson did not think Galactus was evil, calling him a \"god of sorts\" and a \"big, planet-eating guy, simply doing what a big, planet-eating guy does\". The actor spent time \"ruminating\" at the top of tall buildings to prepare for the role. Feige loved the introduction of Galactus in the comics and had long wanted to use him. Ineson stated that Galactus does not care about a planet's life since \"it's his food\", only sparing them if there is something that \"interests\" him there. Feige shared a clip of the character from the video game Fortnite Battle Royale (2017) as a reference for how he should be portrayed. The film uses a comic book-accurate design, in contrast with the cloud-like design in Rise of the Silver Surfer. Galactus's purple and blue armor was built for Ineson to wear, as it was important to Shakman that someone was \"embodying the part\". Ineson had a support crew to keep him cool between takes because of the armor, which was also intended to aid the motion capture process.\nAdditionally, Matthew Wood voices the Fantastic Four's robot companion H.E.R.B.I.E. (Humanoid Experimental Robot B-Type Integrated Electronics), who generally serves as Reed's assistant. Shakman said H.E.R.B.I.E. is charming, adorable, \"slightly put-upon\", and invaluable to the team. Ada Scott and several other babies portray Franklin Richards, the superpowered newborn son of Reed and Sue, while Shakman's daughter Maisie appears as a child Johnny saves. Alex Hyde-White, Rebecca Staab, Jay Underwood, and Michael Bailey Smith, who portrayed the titular team in the unreleased 1994 film The Fantastic Four, make cameo appearances: Hyde-White and Staab play television journalists, Underwood and Smith play power plant workers who salute Johnny, and all four appear together as civilians thanking the Fantastic Four. Martin Dickinson and Greg Haiste appear as Timely Comics employees who are creating comics when the Silver Surfer arrives in Times Square. They are references to Fantastic Four creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Robert Downey Jr. makes an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene as Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom. While his face is not seen, Kirby confirmed that Downey filmed the scene during production of the film Avengers: Doomsday (2026).\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of 20th Century Fox's 2015 film Fantastic Four, co-written and directed by Josh Trank and based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Fantastic Four, Fox began looking at new directions to take the franchise. Having also produced two earlier Fantastic Four films directed by Tim Story a decade prior, the studio did not want to just make another Fantastic Four film. By June 2017, Seth Grahame-Smith was writing a new film that would shift focus to Franklin and Valeria Richards, the children of the original Fantastic Four leaders Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic and Sue Storm / Invisible Woman. Taking inspiration from the comic book series Ultimate Fantastic Four (2004–2009), the screenplay included original Fantastic Four members Ben Grimm / The Thing and Johnny Storm / Human Torch, and was described as kid-centric with a tone closer to the animated film The Incredibles (2004) than Trank's darker film. The basis of Grahame-Smith's screenplay came from a separate script that Carter Blanchard had written as an adaptation of the children's book Kindergarten Heroes by Mark Millar. Millar previously consulted with Fox on their Marvel-based films. In July 2017, Noah Hawley, the creator of the Marvel Television series Legion (2017–2019), was hired to develop a separate film focused on Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom, the Fantastic Four's primary antagonist in the comics and previous films. The Walt Disney Company officially acquired 21st Century Fox in March 2019 and gained the film rights for the Marvel Comics characters that Fox controlled for its subsidiary Marvel Studios, including the Fantastic Four. The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed \"on hold\".\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nMarvel Studios president Kevin Feige confirmed in July 2019 that the company was developing a new Fantastic Four film for their shared universe, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Feige said he was excited about the characters and about \"bringing Marvel's first family up to the sort of platform and level they deserve\". In December 2020, Feige announced that Jon Watts would direct the film after doing so for the first three MCU Spider-Man films (2017–2021). Marvel Studios began meeting with writers by February 2021. That June, Disney CEO Bob Chapek said Feige and Marvel Studios were planning to \"mine\" the Fantastic Four franchise. Watts stepped down as director in April 2022, choosing to take a break from the superhero genre after being \"out of gas\" from dealing with the COVID-19 protocols on Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and its post-production process; he chose to direct the film Wolfs (2024) instead. Grant Curtis and Nick Pepin were producing the new Fantastic Four film after working on the Marvel Studios miniseries Moon Knight (2022).\nJohn Krasinski portrays Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic in the MCU film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). Krasinski had been a popular suggestion for the role among fans for some time, and rumors that he had been cast as Reed had especially circulated since confirmation of the new film's development. The version of the character that he plays in Multiverse of Madness is from Earth-838, an alternate universe to the main MCU, and is a member of the Illuminati. Multiverse of Madness director Sam Raimi said Feige cast Krasinski as the character because it was for an alternate universe cameo appearance that was also an opportunity to deliver on a popular fan casting. This led to speculation about whether Krasinski's role was a one-off or if he would return to star in the new Fantastic Four film. Krasinski later said he appreciated the role, but there had been no discussions about him reprising it.\nMarvel Studios was searching for a new director by June 2022, when the studio was not close to shortening their list of candidates. The list reportedly included high-profile filmmakers, and Feige was said to be looking for a director who could oversee the filming process without him needing to be on set, similar to Raimi. At San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) the next month, Feige announced that the film would be released on November 8, 2024, as the first film in Phase Six of the MCU. Filming was set to begin in 2023. Matt Shakman was in early talks to direct by late August. He and Michael Matthews were considered the finalists in a search that also considered Reid Carolin. Deadline Hollywood felt Shakman was the person to beat given his familiarity with Feige after directing the Marvel Studios miniseries WandaVision (2021). Shakman's pitch to Marvel Studios involved telling a family-centric story of the Fantastic Four, with Reed and Sue becoming parents after they were well-known superheroes; executives were convinced Shakman was the best choice after he showed a picture of him holding his newly born daughter in a meeting while negotiating. Shakman subsequently exited a planned Star Trek film due to the schedule for Fantastic Four, and said he chose to work on the latter because he did not want to pass up the opportunity and was excited by its focus on family, optimism, and technology. Feige confirmed that Shakman would direct at Disney's D23 convention in September. Jeff Kaplan and Ian Springer were writing the script with Feige for some time before Shakman's hiring. The four were set to align their visions for the film while Feige and Shakman began casting. In October, the release date was pushed back to February 14, 2025.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n\n\n==== Casting start and search during the 2023 labor strikes ====\n\nCasting for the Fantastic Four began by February 2023, with a focus on casting the role of Sue Storm / Invisible Woman first. Shakman said the casting process was the biggest challenge because they wanted to find actors who could convey the team's family dynamics. Feige said the group would be a big pillar in the MCU moving forward, and the studio had \"set a very high bar for ourselves\" in wanting to live up to the group's long history in the comics going back to 1961. Josh Friedman was hired to rewrite the script at the end of March. Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter believed Friedman's hiring indicated a possible tonal shift, because he had written many science fiction projects while Kaplan and Springer were known more for comedy. Journalist Jeff Sneider reported that Friedman was hired to bring the film closer to Feige and Shakman's vision to heavily feature cosmic elements from the 1960s comic books, including the characters Galactus and Silver Surfer. Shakman noted that previous Fantastic Four adaptations combined an origin story for the team with Doctor Doom, a character who \"takes up a lot of air\", as the villain. By avoiding a re-telling of the origin story—the film begins four years after the team gains their powers—and using Galactus as the antagonist, he felt they were bringing a fresh perspective to the film. Feige said the decision to avoid re-telling the origin story was similar to how the MCU introduced Peter Parker / Spider-Man without retelling his well-known origin story. Sneider reported that Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom could have a small role such as an appearance in a post-credits scene, and Marvel Studios wanted a major star to play the character.\nBy the start of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike in May, filming was planned to begin in January 2024 in London. Sneider reported that Marvel Studios wanted Adam Driver and Emma Stone to portray Reed and Sue, but they both declined offers in part because the studio did not want to pay the high salaries they asked for; Sneider said Feige wanted to contain the studio's talent spending. In June, the release date was pushed back to May 2, 2025. Before the start of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike in July, Marvel Studios held screen tests for Reed with several actors, including Christopher Abbott and Jamie Dornan, which Sneider said \"did not go very well\". The studio offered the role to Jake Gyllenhaal, who portrayed Quentin Beck / Mysterio in the MCU film Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), but he also asked for a salary that Marvel did not want to pay. They were considering non-white actors for Reed and Pedro Pascal became interested, though he would not engage in conversations during the strike. In August, Ebon Moss-Bachrach was offered the role of Ben Grimm / The Thing, after playing David Lieberman / Micro in the first season of the MCU television series The Punisher (2017). Marvel Studios was committed to casting a Jewish actor like Moss-Bachrach as the Thing, who is depicted as Jewish in the comics but was not portrayed by Jewish actors in the previous Fantastic Four films. David Krumholtz met with Shakman about the role after campaigning for it online, but was unsuccessful. He began campaigning to portray the villain Harvey Elder / Mole Man instead. Sneider reported that Marvel Studios was looking at Vanessa Kirby and Joseph Quinn to portray Sue and her brother Johnny Storm / Human Torch. Nicholas Galitzine was also rumored to be portraying Johnny and had conversations about the role. Marvel approached Matt Smith about portraying Reed, but that was not expected to work out, and they were instead looking for \"a bona fide movie star\". A Latino actor was expected to be hired as Galactus.\nIn October 2023, Shakman said they planned to start filming in early 2024 at Pinewood Studios in England, and the cast would be announced once the SAG-AFTRA strike ended. During the strikes, the crew worked on production design and early tests of the visual effects for the team's abilities. Kasra Farahani returned as production designer from the Marvel Studios series Loki (2021–2023) and Alexandra Byrne returned as costume designer from several MCU films. The team's costumes are pale blue with white necklines, similar to designs introduced in the comics with Fantastic Four vol. 1 #256 (1983) and those worn in Roger Corman's unreleased Fantastic Four film (1994).\n\n\n==== Post-labor strikes and cast announcement ====\nFollowing the conclusion of the actors' strike in November 2023, Pascal entered talks to portray Reed and was negotiating his schedule around other commitments. Marvel Studios was expected to make offers for the other lead roles soon after, having deemed it essential to find the actor for Reed first. According to Shakman, Reed was the most difficult role to cast. Moss-Bachrach was the first actor officially cast in the film. Quinn sought advice on the film from Pascal during the production of their film Gladiator II (2024), not knowing that Pascal was in talks to play Reed. Pascal had not planned to take on such a role and said the film changed his plans \"in a very sudden way\". Javier Bardem was being eyed to portray Galactus after Antonio Banderas was linked to the character, though Bardem had a potential scheduling conflict with the film F1 (2025). Sneider reported that the studio was looking to cast a woman as Silver Surfer, who is usually the male character Norrin Radd. In January 2024, Sneider reported that filming had been delayed to a start between July and September, and this caused Pascal to exit his role in the film Weapons (2025).\n\nOn February 14, 2024, Marvel Studios released a Valentine's Day–themed announcement that confirmed the casting of Pascal as Reed, Kirby as Sue, Quinn as Johnny, and Moss-Bachrach as the Thing. The film, officially titled The Fantastic Four, was delayed to July 25, 2025, swapping places with the MCU film Thunderbolts*. Feige said \"90 percent of the work was done\" by confirming the main cast. The announcement's promotional art included the December 13, 1963, issue of Life magazine with Lyndon B. Johnson on the cover, indicating a 1960s setting, and Pascal referenced 1960s songs from the Beatles when sharing the promotional art on social media. The announcement also revealed the inclusion of the comic book character H.E.R.B.I.E., a robot companion to the Fantastic Four. Feige later confirmed that the film would be a 1960s period piece, but indicated that it would be set in an alternate universe from the main MCU within the multiverse; it is set on Earth-828. Shakman called it a \"retro-future '60s\" aesthetic, \"part what you know from the '60s, but part what you've never seen\". He looked to the optimism of the Space Race and ideas of future space travelers that people had in the 1960s when the comics were first written. Shakman stated, \"I really wanted to take all of that great stuff from Apollo 11 and just imagine that instead of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, it was the Storms and Ben Grimm and Reed Richards heading off into space\". He studied all of the Fantastic Four comics, from their original creation up to present day, and took particular inspiration from Jonathan Hickman's 2009–2011 run for how to approach the main characters. The film includes the Future Foundation philanthropic organization from Hickman's run. Shakman was also inspired by Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and the works of industrial designer and artist Syd Mead. He said his work on the television series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005–present) helped inform his approach to the film's playfulness, collaboration, and improvisation.\nAlso in February 2024, Sneider reported that Bardem was the studio's top choice for Galactus; they had begun meeting with actors for Silver Surfer; and Doctor Doom would be cast during filming. Eric Pearson, who had a reputation for \"taking projects over the finish line\" for Marvel Studios, had been \"quietly hired\" to polish the script. In April, Julia Garner was cast as Shalla-Bal / Silver Surfer. In the comics, Shalla-Bal is the love interest of Norrin Radd and she becomes the Silver Surfer herself in the 1999–2000 Earth-X limited series by Jim Krueger and John Paul Leon. Justin Kroll of Deadline Hollywood reported that no actors held an offer or were in talks for Galactus at that time. WandaVision writer Peter Cameron had contributed to the script by the following month. Several actors joined the cast in May, including Paul Walter Hauser who was cast as Harvey Elder / Mole Man reportedly for a sequence at the beginning of the film. Hauser worked with Shakman on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and met with him to discuss joining The Fantastic Four. He was initially reluctant due to the poor reception of the previous Fantastic Four films, but was won over by the script, cast, and crew. John Malkovich was cast as Ivan Kragoff / Red Ghost, after declining offers for previous Marvel films because he felt the proposed pay was not equal to the work involved. He chose to accept a role in this film to work with Shakman again after the film Cut Bank (2014). Ralph Ineson was cast as Galactus, after appearing as a Ravager pilot in the MCU film Guardians of the Galaxy (2014); Sneider posited that Marvel chose Ineson for his voice acting proficiency, not wanting for another A-list actor after failing to pull Bardem due to the scheduling difficulties. Natasha Lyonne also joined the cast, after voicing the original MCU character Byrdie the Duck in the third season of the Marvel Studios animated series What If...? (2024).\nThree weeks of rehearsals were held with the actors to work through the script with Shakman and Friedman to help define their relationships to one another and how they would exist in their 1960s retro-futuristic setting. Discussing these rehearsals, Pascal explained that it allowed the actors to approach the script \"dramaturgically as you would a play\" while Moss-Bachrach, who believed the script was not completed yet, said it allowed them to share research and consult with astronauts and scientists. At the end of June 2024, Feige said filming would begin at the end of July. A few days of pre-filming occurred before SDCC in late July, capturing footage of an astronaut preparation area, the Thing as a contestant on a dating game show titled Let's Make a Match, and a children's science show hosted by Reed titled Fantastic Science with Mister Fantastic. At the convention, the film's new title was announced to be The Fantastic Four: First Steps. The subtitle references the film's ideas of optimism and space exploration, but Shakman said it also has additional meanings. This led to speculation about what those meanings could be. Also at SDCC, the main cast were revealed to be reprising their roles in the MCU crossover films Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027), and Robert Downey Jr. was announced to be portraying Doctor Doom in those two films. Feige wanted Downey to return to the MCU, after he portrayed Tony Stark / Iron Man in the franchise from 2008 to 2019, and had discussed the actor taking on the role of Doom around a year before the SDCC announcement. Sneider reported that Doom would be introduced in a post-credits scene at the end of First Steps ahead of Downey's appearances in the Avengers films. Shakman said he knew about Downey's casting for a while before the announcement, but he later said Doctor Doom was \"not a part of [his] film, and therefore not a part of [his] purview\". Feige later added that the events of First Steps would lead directly into the story of Doomsday.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began on July 30, 2024, at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England, under the working title Blue Moon. The film was shot for IMAX, with Jess Hall returning from WandaVision as cinematographer. Filming was originally reported to be starting in 2023, and then early 2024, before the strikes.\nShakman wanted the film to look as if it were made by Kubrick in 1965, including with its camera lens choices and general \"approach to filmmaking\". Second unit director of photography Tim Wooster used his father's 16 mm film camera for some sequences. Practical sets and props were employed where possible. The team's Baxter Building penthouse was a two-story contiguous set inspired by \"cozy\" mid-century modern California homes. Reed's lab, inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey, is divided into three sections: a red room for research and inventions, a yellow room with blackboards for thinking, and a blue room with communications equipment for monitoring. A fictionalized version of New York's Yancy Street was built based on how the city's Jewish areas looked during the childhood of Fantastic Four co-creator Jack Kirby, including kosher grocery stores and a synagogue. Pinewood's entire backlot was used for the film's Times Square set. Practical props included a 14-foot (4.3 m) scale model of the Fantastic Four's spaceship, the Excelsior, to create a miniature effect; H.E.R.B.I.E., realized through a combination of a wooden puppet, a remote-controlled animatronic that had a functioning head and arms, and visual effects; and two models of the team's Fantasticar, one that allowed for interior filming with the actors and another that was \"stripped down\" for use in effects shots. Farahani said the Fantasticar was based on \"mid-'60s American concept cars that were actually referencing European cars\". Its accent features, such as its turbine intakes and interface controls, have a 1950s \"retrofuture\" look.\nLocation shooting occurred at Durdle Door in Dorset, England, in mid-October. Lyonne finished filming her scenes later that month. In mid-November, Sarah Niles was revealed to have been cast. Filming took place from November 19–22 at the Palace of Congresses in Oviedo, Spain, for scenes set at the headquarters of the United Nations. Filming also took place in the Middleton mine in Derbyshire Dales, England, and wrapped at the end of November.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nNona Khodai and Tim Roche edited the film. In April 2025, Mark Gatiss was revealed to be appearing as Ted Gilbert, the talk show host of The Ted Gilbert Show. A month later, sound designer Matthew Wood was revealed to be the voice of H.E.R.B.I.E. Additional photography occurred by then, including to add a sequence where Shalla-Bal's backstory is shown. Shakman said the character's role had evolved throughout the writing process, and he came to feel during post-production that her backstory—in which she chooses to give herself to Galactus to save her planet and family—was reflective of the film's themes and the Fantastic Four's choices. Shakman decided that the backstory should be seen by the audience. The film's final screenwriting credits were determined through arbitration with the Writers Guild of America, with the screenplay attributed to Friedman, Pearson, Kaplan, and Springer from a story by Pearson, Kaplan, Springer, and Kat Wood. Pearson's work on the film included moving the birth of Reed and Sue's son, Franklin Richards, from the beginning of the film to during the team's space escape from Galactus in the middle of the film, along with moving the final fight against Galactus from space to Earth to highlight Galactus' scale. He also worked on Johnny researching and unlocking Shalla-Bal's language, with his drafts having more \"flirtatious\" moments between the two than what was in the final film.\nIn July 2025, Shakman revealed that Malkovich's role had been cut from the film and said this was a \"heartbreaking\" decision to make. He explained that Malkovich's role as Red Ghost was originally planned to be part of a sequence at the beginning of the film that chronicles the Fantastic Four's early years as superheroes; this would have included a battle against Red Ghost and his Super-Apes. Shakman praised Malkovich's performance in the role but said the sequence was one of many that were cut to help balance the introduction of the Fantastic Four as a group and individually, their world, and the various other villains in the film. Although Malkovich was cut, the film retains a brief cameo appearance by a cartoon version of Red Ghost in the post-credits scene as part of an in-universe Fantastic Four animated series, which also features the villains Diablo, Dragon Man, Mad Thinker, Puppet Master, and Wizard. Additional characters appearing in the film include the Super-Apes orangutan member Peotor and the ginormous Subterranean creature Giganto. Leading up to the film's release, several actors' roles were revealed, including infant actor Ada Scott as Franklin Richards, Hauser as Mole Man, Niles as Lynne Nichols, and Lyonne as Rachel Rozman. The stars of the unreleased 1994 film The Fantastic Four–Alex Hyde-White, Rebecca Staab, Jay Underwood, and Michael Bailey Smith–were also revealed to be appearing, making cameo appearances throughout the film.\nThe film's mid-credits scene introduces Downey as Doctor Doom and was filmed by Doomsday directors Anthony and Joe Russo during the production of that film. Shakman said the Russos visited the sets for First Steps during its production and watched scenes from the film, as they wanted to familiarize themselves with the Fantastic Four and the other characters \"so they could treat them well, do right by them\" in Doomsday. The film ends with a quote from Jack Kirby, and the reveal that the universe designation of 828 was based on his birthday: August 28, 1917. The film is dedicated to producer Jamie Christopher, who died during pre-production, and Shakman's mother Inez. Scott Stokdyk was the visual effects supervisor, with visual effects provided by Industrial Light & Magic, Framestore, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Digital Domain, Rise FX, and Wētā FX.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nMichael Giacchino was announced to be composing the score in July 2024, after scoring various MCU projects, and his music for the Fantastic Four and Galactus was previewed during a drone show at SDCC that month. His main Fantastic Four theme was played in full at the D23 convention in August during a \"Music of Marvel Studios\" panel that Giacchino moderated, and at the Hollywood Bowl later that month as part of Marvel Studios' Infinity Saga Concert Experience. Mike Roe of TheWrap called the theme \"a jaunty vibe\" that \"blends a dreamy sense with future-looking heroic optimism, along with elements that echo the sounds you might expect from a film featuring, say, a space launch\". He likened it to the score of the MCU film Ant-Man (2015). The theme was released as a digital download single from Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on June 5, 2025, and was made available as a 7-inch vinyl along with \"Let Us Be Devoured\", written and performed by Andrea Datzman, on July 25. Giacchino's full score was released digitally on July 18, 2025.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn April 4, 2024—known as \"4–4 Day\"—Marvel Studios released a teaser poster featuring the Human Torch creating the Fantastic Four symbol. A link was included that led to a 404 error page featuring H.E.R.B.I.E., with an embedded QR code leading to a Future Foundation–themed page with a list of Fantastic Four comics to read on Marvel Unlimited: Fantastic Four vol. 1 #1 (1961), the team's first appearance; Fantastic Four vol. 1 #48–50 (1966), known as \"The Galactus Trilogy\" and featuring the first appearances of Galactus and Silver Surfer; and Fantastic Four: Life Story #1 (2021), which is set in the 1960s. Following a screening of the MCU film Deadpool & Wolverine at SDCC on July 25, a drone show over Petco Park included images of Galactus and the Fantastic Four logo, teasing announcements at Marvel Studios's Hall H panel two nights later. That panel featured Shakman and the main cast, revealed the full title, showed a teaser reel, and had the film's futuristic Fantasticar float across the stage. Shakman explained that the teaser reel featured pre-filming footage combined with pre-visualizations and animatics that were created during development. The footage was presented in an \"old-timey 4:3 aspect ratio\". Further footage was shown at D23 Brazil in November.\nThe first teaser trailer was released on February 4, 2025. Pascal, Kirby, Quinn, and Moss-Bachrach appeared at a fan event at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, which is known as \"Rocket City\", to launch the teaser. Leading up to this, a short \"teaser for the first teaser\" was released featuring children running to a television that displays Fantastic Four imagery. Vulture's Jesse David Fox noted a stock sound effect used for the children's laughter, wondering if it was an intentional indication of something or if the footage had just been rushed. Kotaku's Zack Zwiezen likened the widely used sound effect, which had originally been recorded for the film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), to the Wilhelm scream sound effect. He was confused why it was used twice in such a short clip. Discussing the full teaser, Ben Travis at Empire felt the film was \"on the right track\", appreciating the tone and style as well as different references to the comics. Several commentators noted that all of the Fantastic Four's powers are seen except for Reed's stretching abilities. A scene of the Thing cooking with H.E.R.B.I.E. was highlighted by commentators who compared it to Moss-Bachrach's role as chef Richie Jerimovich in the series The Bear (2022–present). The teaser was viewed 202 million times in its first 24 hours, the third-best for a Marvel Studios trailer after those for Deadpool & Wolverine (365M) and 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home (355M). It became the top trending video on YouTube, and a livestream of the teaser's launch became Marvel's most-viewed ever. Alongside the teaser, Marvel also released several posters featuring the tagline \"Prepare 4 Launch\". One of these was criticized by some who believed it was created with artificial intelligence (AI), pointing to a woman's face seemingly being used multiple times and hands that appear to have the wrong number of fingers. Marvel denied that AI was used, and other commentators suggested these issues could be the result of poor photoshopping. IMAX screenings for the MCU film Captain America: Brave New World, released later in February, featured a First Steps–themed countdown.\nFootage was shown at the 2025 CinemaCon, which gave a first look at Garner's Silver Surfer and revealed that Sue and Reed are expecting a child in the film. Sydney Bucksbaum at Entertainment Weekly said Sue being pregnant gave \"new meaning\" to the film's title. When the subtitle was originally announced, Jenna Anderson at ComicBook.com theorized \"First Steps\" could refer to the first steps of a child, indicating the film would see the introduction of either of Reed and Sue's children, Franklin and Valeria Richards; both were not seen in the previous Fantastic Four films. The CinemaCon footage was not released online, despite speculation that a full trailer could be released on April 4, 2025. Instead, a new \"retro-styled\" poster featuring silhouettes of the Fantastic Four was released on that day alongside an Empire feature that revealed new details about the film. The CinemaCon footage was subsequently released as a trailer on April 17. Michael Cripe at IGN said the trailer had more action than the teaser, including a first look at Reed's stretching abilities. Commentators also noted the focus on Garner's Silver Surfer. At the end of April, Marvel Comics and Marvel Studios announced a tie-in one-shot comic titled Fantastic Four: First Steps, which was released on July 9. It was written by Matt Fraction and drawn by Mark Buckingham, with cover art by Phil Noto. Marvel Comics worked with the film's creative team to ensure the comic matched the film's style and tone, and the comics team visited the set during filming. It is presented as an in-universe comic published by the Future Foundation on the fourth anniversary of the Fantastic Four gaining their powers, serving as an \"authorized retelling\" of the team's early adventures.\nA commercial for the Little Caesars pizza chain, directed by Farahani and released in June, features an homage to the first Fantastic Four comic book issue in which the team fights Giganto. Also in June, Feige promoted the film at CineEurope as part of a wider Disney presentation. A new trailer for the film was shown. Fantastic Four-themed games were added to Topgolf locations in conjunction with the film's release. AMC Theaters released a limited-edition popcorn bucket of Galactus to promote the film. The container can hold 9 liters (2.37 gallons) of popcorn and earned a Guinness World Record for the largest popcorn container commercially available.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps had its world premiere at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles on July 21, 2025. The premiere was live-streamed on Disney+ – a first for a Disney premiere – featuring interviews with the cast and creatives along with an exclusive sneak peek at the film, with a replay available following the live-stream. The premiere also featured a performance of Michael Giacchino's Marvel Studios logo fanfare and an orchestral suite of selections from the score by a large orchestra and chorus live on stage preceding the film. The film was released in the United States on July 25, in IMAX, ScreenX, and 4DX. It was previously scheduled for November 8, 2024, February 14, 2025, and May 2, 2025. It is the first film, and start, of Phase Six of the MCU.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of September 2, 2025, The Fantastic Four: First Steps has grossed $266.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $241.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $508.2 million.\nOn July 22, 2025, the film was projected to make $100–110 million at the domestic box office, with an additional $90–100 million overseas for a total of $190–210 million during its opening weekend. The film made $24.4 million in Thursday night previews, the biggest preview box office of 2025, surpassing that of Superman, which had been released two weeks earlier. It collected $57 million on its first day, ranking below A Minecraft Movie as the second-highest opening day for a 2025 film. The film would end up debuting to $117.6 million at the domestic box office, and a total of $216.7 million globally. The film made $11.7 million on its second Friday, a drastic 80% drop. This is the second biggest Friday-to-Friday drop for any comic book movie in 2025, behind Captain America: Brave New World. The Fantastic Four: First Steps retained the top spot at the box office in its second weekend, but it declined by 66% with a gross of $38.7 million. Likewise, the film remained at number one for two consecutive weekends in the United Kingdom and Ireland, grossing £3 million ($4.1 million) in its second week and bringing its cumulative total to £15.3 million ($20.4 million) in those markets. During its third weekend, the film fell to third place, grossing $15.8 million.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 87% of 388 critics gave the film a positive review. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Benefitting from rock-solid cast chemistry and clad in appealingly retro 1960s design, this crack at The Fantastic Four does Marvel's First Family justice.\" Metacritic summarized the critical response as \"generally favorable\", based on a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 from 54 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\nVariety felt that the film foregoing the origin story and taking place in the midst of the team as active heroes was a strong suit. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw wrote it \"hangs together as an entertaining spectacle in its own innocent self-enclosed universe of fantasy wackiness\", writing the production design was \"hallucinatory\" in its 1960s aesthetic, and said it kept the superhero genre \"aloft\". The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney similarly praised the 60s vibe, feeling Giacchino's orchestral score, the production design and costuming were complementary. Rooney felt that Moss-Bachrach portrayed \"warmth and sensitivity\" behind his motion-capture character and wrote of Garner's commanding portrayal of an \"icy\" to \"sorrowful\" character arc.\nRobbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph said the film \"makes you wish that Marvel had reached this point years ago – imagine if 2019's Avengers: Endgame had been followed by this. Yet at least they're here now, and the result is a very unusual sort of franchise instalment: one that feels every inch a one-off.\" Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote, \"The action is as spectacular as you would expect, which doesn't mean that it's particularly suspenseful, but the film's success lies in the fact it puts the fun back into the franchise.\"\nEsther Zuckerman of Bloomberg News was more critical, writing, \"While Superman felt bracingly modern with the political sentiments to boot, The Fantastic Four has a halo of cobwebs it can't quite shake off.\" Livemint's Udita Jhunjhunwala praised the cast performances, but said the film was \"competent at best—a reboot with cosmic ambition that barely attains lift-off.\" The Australian's Stephen Romei praised the opening sequence but criticized the film's dialogue, concluding, \"The superhero movie franchise has its ups and downs. This one is definitely on the downside.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nFirst Steps was nominated for Most Anticipated Film at the 8th Astra Midseason Movie Awards.\n\n\n== Future ==\nA sequel to First Steps was reported to be in development in June 2025. In August, Sneider reported that Shakman was expected to return to direct the sequel, which Marvel Studios believed would perform better financially than First Steps once the Fantastic Four had been seen in Doomsday and Secret Wars.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website  at Marvel.com\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps at IMDb \nFuture Foundation viral marketing website",

        "title": "Sydney Sweeney",
        "content": "Sydney Bernice Sweeney (born September 12, 1997) is an American actress. She gained early recognition for her roles in Everything Sucks!, The Handmaid's Tale, and Sharp Objects. She received wider acclaim for her performances in the drama series Euphoria (2019–present) and the first season of the anthology series The White Lotus (2021), both of which earned her nominations for Primetime Emmy Awards.\nIn film, Sweeney appeared in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) and later had leading roles in the drama film Reality and the romantic comedy Anyone but You. In 2024, she starred in the superhero film Madame Web and produced and starred in the horror film Immaculate.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSydney Bernice Sweeney was born on September 12, 1997, in Spokane, Washington. Her mother is a former criminal defense lawyer, and her father works in the hospitality industry. She has one brother. Sweeney was raised in the Idaho panhandle along the Washington border, at a rural lakeside home that her family has inhabited for five generations. She has said her family is religious.\nSweeney attended school at Saint George's School in Spokane. She was active in numerous sports: \"I was in every single sport possible\", she said. \"I was on the soccer team, the baseball team, the snow slalom ski team, I was wakeboarding.\" Sweeney said she had a wakeboarding accident as a child when the edge of her board propelled backward and sliced the area next to her eye, leaving a permanent scar.\nSweeney became interested in acting after auditioning to be an extra in an independent film that was shooting in the Spokane area. To convince her parents to allow her to pursue acting, she presented them with a five-year business plan. Sweeney began to audition and book commercial acting jobs in Seattle and Portland, Oregon, where the family temporarily resided, until choosing to move to Los Angeles when she was 13 years old.\nIn high school, Sweeney was on the robotics team and in the mathematics club. She was valedictorian of her graduating class at Brighton Hall School in Burbank, California. In 2016, Sweeney briefly worked at Universal Studios Hollywood, but left after she had been hired for an acting job. She also briefly attended the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early work (2009–2019) ===\n\nBeginning her career as a child actress, Sweeney debuted on television in 2009 with a bit part in an episode of the series Heroes.  Her first film role was in the 2010 horror comedy ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction.  She played supporting roles in television shows such as 90210, Criminal Minds, Grey's Anatomy and Pretty Little Liars. In 2018, she starred as Emaline Addario in the Netflix series Everything Sucks!, which revolved around two groups of high school students in Oregon in 1996. She then appeared in the HBO miniseries Sharp Objects, recurring as Alice, a roommate whom Amy Adams's character meets at a psychiatric facility. Her character originally had a smaller role, but the director kept bringing her in for more scenes. For the role, Sweeney studied stories of girls who experience mental illness and self-harming, and visited hospitals with patients who self-harmed. She filmed Everything Sucks! and Sharp Objects concurrently, the former during the week and latter on weekends.\nSweeney had a role in the 2018 film Under the Silver Lake. She had a recurring role in the second season of the dystopian drama series The Handmaid's Tale as Eden Spencer, a pious and obedient girl from the totalitarian and theocratic Republic of Gilead. She also starred as the heroine of the horror film Along Came the Devil. In 2019, Sweeney appeared in the drama film Clementine, the coming-of-age film Big Time Adolescence, and Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\n\n=== Breakthrough (2019–present) ===\nIn June 2019, Sweeney began portraying Cassie Howard, a teenager with a promiscuous reputation, in the HBO drama series Euphoria. The show was a breakout hit, becoming the second most watched HBO series. Her performance was praised, earning a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2022. Variety wrote that her performance \"proves that Sweeney's one hell of a shapeshifter between her deft turns in this, The Handmaid's Tale, Everything Sucks and Sharp Objects.\" Her many nude scenes in the series received significant attention, generating discussions about nudity in film and the male gaze. Sweeney has said she does not consider on-screen nudity a boundary.\n\nIn 2020, Sweeney founded the production company Fifty-Fifty Films. The same year, she starred in the television film Nocturne and Webtoon’s live-action advertisement for the online comic Lore Olympus, appearing as Persephone. In 2021, Sweeney appeared in the first season of Mike White's anthology series The White Lotus as a sardonic college sophomore. For that performance, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie in 2022. She appeared on the Time 100 Next list for 2022. \nIn 2023, Sweeney starred as U.S. Air Force veteran Reality Winner in Tina Satter's thriller drama Reality, which premiered in February at the 73rd Berlin Film Festival. Steph Green of IndieWire called the film \"inventively mounted and extraordinarily tense\" and Sweeney \"the real deal\". Jessica Kiang of Variety wrote that she played Winner \"so convincingly that it's hard to remember her as the sardonic, pampered teen in The White Lotus, or the nice-girl-turned-nasty in Euphoria\". Sweeney next had a role in the crime thriller Americana, which premiered at the South by Southwest Festival in March 2023.\nSweeney starred in the video for the Rolling Stones' single \"Angry\", from their 2023 album Hackney Diamonds. In response to criticism that the video objectified her, she defended it as \"empowerment through embracing my body\". At age 25, Sweeney was selected as one of Forbes's 2023 30 Under 30 in the celebrity category. She and Glen Powell starred in the romantic comedy Anyone but You, which premiered in December 2023. It became a commercial sleeper hit. Sweeney was an executive producer for the film and was instrumental in hiring Powell and director Will Gluck. She also contributed to the script.\nIn 2024, Sweeney had a supporting role in the superhero film Madame Web, set in Sony's Spider-Man Universe franchise. It was released in February and received negative reviews, bombing at the box office. Of the film's commercial and critical failure, Sweeney said, \"I was just hired as an actress in it, so I was just along for the ride for whatever was going to happen.\" \nIn March 2024, Sweeney hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live. Following her appearance, conservative Canadian newspaper National Post ran an article asking \"Are Sydney Sweeney's breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\", and right-wing academic Richard Hanania tweeted \"Wokeness is dead\" alongside a clip of Sweeney centered on her bust. Sweeney called the obsession with her appearance \"this weird relationship that people have with me that I have no control over\".\nSweeney then produced and starred in the psychological horror film Immaculate. Sweeney originally auditioned for the project in 2014. Years later, she purchased the rights to the screenplay and hired frequent collaborator Michael Mohan to direct. Sweeney has said that she considered producing a way to create opportunities for herself. Later in 2024, she co-starred in Eden, directed by Ron Howard. Reviewing the film for TheWrap, critic Chase Hutchinson wrote that Sweeney \"runs away with the whole thing ... it's her subtle looks and a growing agency that turns Eden into something more ... every moment with her at the forefront is Eden at its best.\" \nIn June 2025, Sweeney starred alongside Julianne Moore in Echo Valley. She learned how to ride horses for the role. In August, Americana was released in theaters to low box office. Several medias labeled it a flop, though Deadline argued that it would be profitable in terms of an indie film.\n\n\n==== Upcoming ====\nSweeney is set to star in Christy, a biopic about boxer Christy Martin which she has also produced. Of taking the role, Sweeney said: \"I was blown away and inspired by [Martin's] strength, her perseverance, and who she is as a woman. Having a character that has so many layers and depths, that's a dream as an actor... Then, on the physical side, I grew up kickboxing and grappling. I'm a very outdoorsy, athletic person, so to play a character that [required me] to transform myself was a dream. I loved every part of it.\" As of 2025, Sweeney is set to co-star in The Housemaid, an adaptation of the bestselling novel of the same name.\nSweeney is attached to play Kim Novak in Scandalous, a romantic drama to be directed by Colman Domingo. It will shoot in early 2026.\n\n\n== Brand endorsements ==\n\nIn January 2023, Sweeney became a brand ambassador for Armani Beauty and Laneige. \nIn May 2025, she received widespread attention on social media after partnering with personal care brand Dr. Squatch to launch a limited-edition soap line containing her bathwater.\nIn July 2025, Sweeney appeared in an advertising campaign for American Eagle Outfitters called \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\", which became a subject of controversy. Some social media users claimed that the pun on \"jeans\" and \"genes\", associated with an attractive white woman, promoted eugenic thinking and white supremacy. The extent of the initial backlash was exaggerated by conservative media and commentators. This, in turn, increased left-wing criticism of the campaign. Mainstream media widely reported on the controversy. Even the Trump administration commented on it. The Hollywood Reporter was unsure whether this \"media firestorm\" had negatively impacted the box office returns of Americana.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSweeney started dating businessman Jonathan Davino in 2018, and they became engaged in 2022. They produced films together (including Anyone but You and Immaculate), and Sweeney considered Davino her \"producing partner\". The couple separated in 2025.\nSweeney is an automobile enthusiast. She has restored a 1969 Ford Bronco and a 1965 Ford Mustang, and also owns a 1956 Ford F100 with original patina, gifted by her grandfather. In partnership with Ford, Sweeney designed a custom 2024 Mustang.\nIn 2021, Sweeney made her first significant real estate purchase, a 3,200-square-foot (300 m2) Tudor-style home in Los Angeles, for $3 million. In 2023, she bought a $9.9 million \"fixer-upper mansion\" in Los Angeles's Bel Air neighborhood, and in 2024 she bought a $13.5 million home in the Florida Keys.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Podcasts ===\n\n\n=== Web ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSydney Sweeney at IMDb",

        "title": "KPop Demon Hunters",
        "content": "KPop Demon Hunters is a 2025 American animated musical urban fantasy film directed by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans from a screenplay they co-wrote with the writing team of Danya Jimenez and Hannah McMechan, based on a story conceived by Kang. Produced by Sony Pictures Animation for Netflix, the film stars the voices of Arden Cho, Ahn Hyo-seop, May Hong, Ji-young Yoo, Yunjin Kim, Daniel Dae Kim, Ken Jeong, and Lee Byung-hun. It follows a K-pop girl group, Huntr/x, who lead double lives as demon hunters; they face off against a rival boy band, the Saja Boys, whose members are secretly demons.\nKPop Demon Hunters originated from Kang's desire to create a story inspired by her Korean heritage, drawing on elements of mythology, demonology, and K-pop to craft a visually distinct and culturally rooted film. The film was reported to be in production at Sony Pictures Animation by March 2021, with the full creative team attached. The film was animated by Sony Pictures Imageworks and was stylistically influenced by concert lighting, editorial photography, and music videos as well as anime and Korean dramas. The soundtrack features original songs by several talents, and a score composed by Marcelo Zarvos.\nKPop Demon Hunters began streaming on Netflix on June 20, 2025, while a sing-along version of the film received a two-day limited theatrical release from August 23 to 24, 2025. The film drew acclaim for its animation, visual style, voice acting, writing, and music, and was named a cultural phenomenon by several publications. It surpassed Red Notice (2021) to become the most-watched film in Netflix history with 236 million views, and its sing-along theatrical release was both the widest for a Netflix film and the first to top the box office in the United States, surpassing Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022). The film's soundtrack also saw significant success, reaching number one and top-ten positions on multiple music and streaming charts, as well as becoming the first film soundtrack on the Billboard Hot 100 to have four of its songs in the top ten. A sequel is in development.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nLong ago, demons preyed on humans, feeding their souls to their ruler Gwi-Ma. Eventually, three women became demon hunters and sealed the demons away with a magical barrier called the Honmoon. Their legacy continued across the generations, with each new trio using their singing voices to maintain the Honmoon, working to eventually strengthen it into the Golden Honmoon – a final seal that would banish demons from the human world permanently.\nIn the present, the K-pop girl group Huntr/x – comprised of Rumi, Mira, and Zoey – is the latest demon-hunting trio under the guidance of Celine, a previous hunter who raised Rumi. After completing their world tour, Huntr/x release and prepare for the first live performance of a new single, \"Golden\", until Rumi begins losing her voice due to her secret demon heritage, which only Celine knows about. As a child, Rumi was told by Celine that turning the Honmoon gold would erase her demon marks.\nIn the demon world, Gwi-Ma grows enraged at his minions' failures. Five demons, led by former human Jinu, form a K-pop boy band called the Saja Boys to steal Huntr/x's fans and weaken the Honmoon, in exchange for Gwi-Ma erasing Jinu's human memories. Huntr/x quickly discovers the Saja Boys' demonic nature while encountering them during their debut. Jinu discovers Rumi's demon marks as they fight, but helps hide it from her bandmates.\nMeeting her privately, Jinu tells Rumi that feelings of shame enslave demons through voices from Gwi-Ma. He reveals that around 400 years earlier, Gwi-Ma granted him a beautiful voice that helped him and his family emerge from poverty, but then condemned him to the demon world. Jinu now lives with guilt over his family's subsequent downfall.\nAs the Idol Awards approach, Huntr/x rush to produce a new song, \"Takedown\", to expose the Saja Boys while their popularity skyrockets. Mira grows suspicious when Rumi questions if \"Takedown\" is too hateful toward demons. Torn between her identities, Rumi proposes a plan to Jinu: if he helps Huntr/x win the Idol Awards and strengthen the Honmoon, he could freely stay in the human world. Later, Rumi confides in Jinu that her shame over her heritage weakened her voice, but talking with him healed it. Jinu states that he no longer hears voices thanks to Rumi, and agrees to sabotage the Saja Boys. Gwi-Ma summons Jinu, reminding him of their deal and the truth that he abandoned his family for a life of wealth and comfort, before threatening to return the tormenting voices unless he obeys him.\nAt the Idol Awards, the Saja Boys fail to appear, and Huntr/x perform \"Golden\", having chosen to shelve \"Takedown\" due to the contention it caused within the group. However, impostor demons sent by Jinu split Mira and Zoey from Rumi, then pose as them to trick Rumi into performing \"Takedown\", during which they publicly reveal her demon marks. She flees the stage and runs into the real Mira and Zoey, who feel betrayed upon learning of her heritage and collusion with Jinu. Rumi confronts Jinu for tricking her, and he admits to lying about his past. Gwi-Ma casts a trance over Mira, Zoey, and the public, drawing them to the Saja Boys' final performance designed to shatter the weakened Honmoon and unleash him. Rumi meets with Celine and desperately asks her to end her life. Celine refuses and offers to conceal the events, but Rumi lashes out at Celine for never fully loving her before leaving.\nRumi interrupts the Saja Boys' performance with a new song addressing shame and self-acceptance, breaking Gwi-Ma's trance. Reunited, Huntr/x fight back and free the crowd. A repentant Jinu sacrifices himself to save Rumi from Gwi-Ma, giving his restored soul to her; the empowered Huntr/x defeat Gwi-Ma and the Saja Boys, re-sealing the demons and creating a new Honmoon.\nAfterward, Rumi, no longer ashamed of her marks, reconciles with Mira and Zoey, and they later meet with their fans in public.\n\n\n== Voice cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn March 2021, a film with the working title K-Pop: Demon Hunters was announced to be underway at Sony Pictures Animation. Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans would direct with writing duo Hannah McMechan and Danya Jimenez writing the script and Aron Warner and Michelle L. M. Wong serving as producers. Mingjue Helen Chen and Ami Thompson were also announced as production designer and art director, respectively.\nIt was conceived by Kang who wanted to make a film \"set in Korean culture\"; she \"delved into mythology and demonology for something that could be visually unique\" compared to \"mainstream media\". She also called the film her \"love letter to K-pop\" and her \"Korean roots\". On character design, Kang highlighted wanting to differentiate from \"Marvel female superheroes that were just sexy and cool and badass\" and instead have \"girls who had potbellies and burped and were crass and silly and fun\" leading to the creation of \"something that encompassed all of those elements\". She was also influenced by \"how Bong Joon Ho juggles so many different tones in his films to where they feel very animated\". Appelhans came on board later on after Kang told him her initial ideas for the film; he planned to take a long break after having directed Wish Dragon (2021). He stated that he \"always wanted to do a film about the power of music – to unite, bring joy, build community.\" Kang explained that when developing the history of the demon hunters they decided to play into \"the shaman women from Korean culture\" as historically these women would \"sing and dance to protect their village and their communities\".\nThe three members of Huntr/x were modeled after K-pop girl groups like Itzy, Blackpink, and Twice. Kang commented that 2NE1 and Blackpink provided an early reference. The character of Mira was inspired by Korean model Ahn So-yeon. The Saja Boys were inspired by Korean boy bands such as Tomorrow X Together, BTS, Stray Kids, Ateez, BigBang, and Monsta X. Korean actor and singer Cha Eun-woo was a key influence for Jinu, the group's leader. Jinu is the only Saja Boy who \"has a real name\" while \"the rest of the band members have names that are more descriptive of K-pop archetypes\". Baek Byung-yeul of The Korea Times stated the styling of both groups connects to \"the past and the present of Korea\" – the members of Huntr/x \"wear 'norigae' pendants integrated into modern K-pop fashion, while Saja Boys perform in black hanbok and traditional horsehair hats for their song 'Your Idol,' evoking the image of the jeoseung saja, the Korean equivalent of the grim reaper\". Additionally, the weapons Huntr/x wields are rooted in \"traditional Korean objects\". Max Kim of the Los Angeles Times noted the historical nods to Korean artists \"who are seen today as the progenitors of contemporary K-pop\" such as the Jeogori Sisters, The Kim Sisters and S.E.S.. Kang highlighted the visual journey in the character design such as the Saja Boys starting in a \"bubble gum pop, very saccharine, super sweet look\" and shifting darker until they \"look like the iconic Grim Reaper with the hat\". Appelhans commented that one of the design challenges were the costumes since they also acted as \"plot points\", noting that the gold outfits worn during the \"Golden\" song symbolize \"their kind of MacGuffin of a dream\" where Huntr/x aspire for perfection and being \"beyond reproach\". However, at the second act's end, the ideal is visually represented as broken as \"Rumi is standing there\" with the dream \"literally and physically in tatters\".\n\nHanh Nguyen, for Salon, highlighted that Jinu's pet tiger and magpie – which the creative team call Derpy and Sussy respectively – are based on minhwa, \"a style of Korean folk art popular during the [Joseon period], with the Hojak-do genre specializing in images of tigers, magpies, and pine trees\"; the depiction of these animals together changed over time \"to become more satirical by the 17th century\". Park Han-sol of The Korea Times wrote that minhwa was often \"whimsical\" with \"mischievous details\" and depictions of tiger and magpie delivered \"a playful jab at those in power\". She commented that the film's gag of the magpie stealing the tiger's hat \"feels like an affectionate nod to the long-running visual joke\". Story artist Radford Sechrist explained that \"Derpy's bright blue hue\" possibly originated with production designer Helen Mingjue Chen wanting to give \"the tiger a more magical feel\" and confirmed that Sussy has \"six eyes total, three on each side\". Kang commented that Derpy was initially conceived as a \"fun character\" without a clear role, however, they did not want him to be just \"a sidekick\". The team was inspired by a painting by Chen of \"a statue of a tiger turning into a real tiger\" next to an open shirt Jinu which led to the idea of Derpy being Jinu's pet, eventually becoming \"a mailbox basically\" to help the characters communicate \"and then the bird tagged along\". Kang also stated that while the animals \"live between these two worlds\", they are not demons and it is left mysterious.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nThe castings for the characters' voice actors and singing voices were done at separate times, with the singers being cast earlier. Ejae was originally brought onto the production as a songwriter, before later being offered the role of Rumi's singing voice; in an interview with Genius Korea, Ejae attributed her casting to \"the directors [getting] used to hearing [her] voice in the demos\". Arden Cho, the voice actress for Rumi, initially auditioned for the role of Celine, only subsequently trying out for the role of Rumi due to the encouragement of co-director Maggie Kang. Park Jin-young was initially envisioned for the role of Gwi-Ma, due to the character originally being conceptualized with a more flamboyant and comedic personality. However, this was dropped as the character was developed into a more menacing and traditionally antagonistic figure, leading instead to the casting of Lee Byung-hun. In April 2025, Ji-young Yoo was revealed to star in the film as Zoey. The rest of the cast was announced later that month.\n\n\n=== Animation ===\nThe film was animated by Sony Pictures Imageworks in both its Vancouver and Montreal facilities with Josh Beveridge as the head of character animation. Appelhans highlighted inspiration was drawn from \"music videos, editorial photography, K-dramas, concert lighting, a touch of anime\". Kang explained that after watching Sony's Spider-Verse films, which are animated in a \"hybrid 2D-3D style\", it was decided to \"pull away from every 2D element in our movie\" and \"[take] a lot of inspiration from faces and the look and feel of anime\" with the aim of doing \"a CG version of it\". Beveridge similarly noted the inspiration of \"2D aesthetics but with three-dimensional language\" and that the film should have a \"very bold graphic look\". Beveridge also highlighted shifting the characters' faces to reflect the film's tone, from \"high-glamour moments\" where \"they need to feel like pop stars in an animated world\", to \"animated aggro\" which has \"faces with a lot more line work, a lot more angularity\", to \"hyper-ridiculous\" moments referred to as \"Chibi, or demi-Chibi\", with characters having \"super-cute and exaggerated features\". Kang emphasized the crew's effort to authentically represent Korean identity through character animation, such as \"mouth shapes and eye shapes that were very Korean\". Although the characters speak English, Kang explained that the animators designed \"mouth shapes that you would only make as a Korean person, with our Korean language\".\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nWhen comparing the songs of Huntr/x and the Saja Boys, Appelhans explained they \"wanted the Saja Boys' songs to be super catchy, but slightly hollow, like there's no real soul underneath\" which contrasts with the \"emotionally vulnerable and honest\" Huntr/x songs – \"the idea was that the surface-level part of your heart might be obsessed with the boys, but the deeper part is moved by the girls\". The film's original songs were written by Danny Chung, Ido, Vince, Kush, Ejae, Jenna Andrews, Stephen Kirk, Lindgren, Mark Sonnenblick, and Daniel Rojas; and produced by Teddy Park, 24, Ido, Dominsuk, Andrews, Kirk, Lindgren, and Ian Eisendrath. Marcelo Zarvos composed the score. The soundtrack also features the voices of Ejae, Audrey Nuna, Rei Ami, Andrew Choi, Kevin Woo, samUIL Lee, Neckwav, and Lea Salonga. The soundtrack was released on June 20, 2025; the lead single \"Takedown\" is performed by Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Chaeyoung of Twice.\nIn the United States, the soundtrack album holds the highest debut on the Billboard 200 chart for soundtracks released in 2025, debuting at number eight, and is the first soundtrack of 2025 to reach the top ten. The album is also the highest-charting animated film's soundtrack album on the chart since Metro Boomin's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023) at number seven, as well as the first Netflix soundtrack to reach number one on the Top Soundtracks since Stranger Things: Soundtrack from the Netflix Series, Season 4 (2022). The BBC highlighted that Huntr/x and the Saja Boys – with \"Golden\" and \"Your Idol\" respectively – topped the US Spotify chart with Huntr/x hitting \"number two on the chart, surpassing Blackpink as the highest-charting female K-pop group\", and the Saja Boys becoming \"the highest charting male K-pop group in US Spotify history\", surpassing BTS. \"Golden\", the album's second single, eventually reached number one on the Billboard Global 200, number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, and in South Korea became the third song in 2025 to achieve a perfect all-kill on the charts, as well as breaking the record for most number of hourly perfect all-kills of all time. Additionally, the film's soundtrack became the first in the history of the Billboard Top 100 to feature four of its songs in the top 10, which include \"Golden\", \"Your Idol\", \"Soda Pop\", and \"How It's Done\". It is the first film soundtrack since Waiting to Exhale (1995) to feature at least three of its songs in the top 10.\n\n\n== Release ==\nWhen the film was first announced in March 2021, a release timetable was not set. Later on that same month, the film was listed to have a release type of theatrical. In April 2022, it was reported that Netflix registered a filing for the film. The film was confirmed to be coming to the streamer in February 2023, in a Business Insider interview with Sony Pictures film CEO Tom Rothman. In 2021, Sony entered into concurrent agreements with Netflix. According to Matthew Belloni of Puck, this included both \"an output deal with Netflix for its theatrical films\" and \"a separate 'direct-to-platform' arrangement\". Under the latter, Sony agreed to give Netflix \"a first look at certain live-action and animated film projects\", with Netflix guaranteeing to \"greenlight a minimum number\" for joint development which \"Netflix would release and control\". KPop Demon Hunters is among the titles produced under this direct-to-platform deal. Belloni reported that, under the terms of the arrangement, \"Sony would be paid a pre-negotiated premium on top of the budgets for the films\", with sources indicating that the premium \"was 25 percent of the budgets, capped at $20 million per film\", and that \"Netflix would keep all the rights and pay no profit participation\". Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter highlighted that Netflix covered the \"entire $100 million budget in addition to paying Sony a fee of $25 million\"; \"Sony also receives a piece of soundtrack sales\", \"music publishing fees for certain songs\" and \"a portion of the money Netflix is paying Sony's animation company\".\nIn June 2024, the film was announced to be released in 2025. In April 2025, it was revealed by an animator that the film would be released in June, while later that month, it was announced for a release date of June 20, 2025. In addition to streaming on Netflix, KPop Demon Hunters had a limited theatrical release at select cinemas in California and New York. Billboard noted this release was \"just enough to satisfy the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences' highly specific eligibility requirements\". A sing-along version of the film was released theatrically in select theaters in North America, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand from August 23–24, 2025. This version was subsequently released on Netflix.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Audience viewership ===\nOn July 29, 2025, Netflix announced that KPop Demon Hunters had become the platform's \"most watched original animated film of all time\". It was then reported on August 26 that KPop Demon Hunters had surpassed Red Notice (2021) as the platform's most-watched film, being viewed 236 million times in the ten weeks following its premiere.\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe sing-along version of KPop Demon Hunters debuted in theaters on August 23, 2025 and was initially projected to gross between $18–20 million from 1,700 theatres during its opening weekend. It was the widest ever theatrical release for a Netflix release, beating out the 698 theatres that Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022) opened in, and became the first Netflix film to finish in first place over the weekend. It also became the best-performing theatrical release for the platform, beating out Glass Onion ($13.1 million in 2022). However, Netflix opted out of reporting grosses. \nIn the United States and Canada, KPop Demon Hunters made $19.2 million at the box office during its two days from 1,700 theaters, ahead of Weapons, which was expected to remain in first during its third weekend. Jeremy Fuster of TheWrap highlighted that despite KPop Demon Hunters being released on streaming in June 2025, its short theatrical release was set to open higher than the three-day opening weekends of The Bad Guys 2 ($22 million) and Elio ($20.8 million). With the 2025 summer season seeing no animated films gross over $100 million domestically, Fuster opined that KPop Demon Hunters would have crossed that mark despite its rapid popularity being attributed to its release on Netflix.\nMatt Schimkowitz of The A.V. Club commented that while Netflix generally avoided general theatrical releases, the limited release window showed high demand from audiences who most likely have already seen the film on Netflix. Ben Fritz of The Wall Street Journal similarly noted such, stating that Netflix generally avoided theatrical releases for their films outside of limited releases for awards eligibility \"and to satisfy A-list filmmakers\". The decision to release KPop Demon Hunters theatrically was brought on due to the acclaim it has attained.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nKPop Demon Hunters received widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences, who praised its animation, music, voice acting, and story. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 71 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Animated with infectious energy and vibrant colors, KPop Demon Hunters is jaunty family entertainment with a terrific soundtrack to boot.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. The film has been widely noted as a cultural phenomenon by a variety of media outlets, many highlighting the film's soundtrack, characters, and story, as well as homages to anime and representation of \"fandom\" and Asian cultures being considered significant to its success. The film's popularity was described as \"unexpected\" and \"break-out\", with several pointing out its streaming success similar to that of Disney's Encanto (2021). \nBrandon Yu, for The New York Times, stated KPop Demon Hunters \"is an original universe that is charming, funny and artfully punchy\", commenting that it \"is funniest when it pokes at pop culture that is highly manufactured, from K-pop to K-dramas to mass-produced singing competitions\". Matt Goldberg of TheWrap commented that the plot would \"be painfully overwrought if not for the terrific thread of comedy\" throughout the film, noting it \"knows when to poke fun at K-pop and K-drama tropes\". David Tizzard of The Korea Times called the film \"outrageously good\" and praised its representation of Korean culture, saying that it \"quietly captures the texture of everyday life with an intimacy rarely seen in global content\". Tizzard also commented that it is not only \"a love letter to K-pop\" but it is \"also a sharply observed, sometimes unflinching look at the culture that surrounds it\". Yu noted that it \"shares a kind of lineage\" with Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Verse and while it shares a \"similar visual style\", what the film \"borrows mostly is a more holistic and technical sense of the cinematic\" with \"fluid\" action, \"striking\" art, and music that serves as a \"dynamic storytelling tool\". Isaiah Colbert of Io9 similarly commented that \"the animation team at Sony Pictures Animation didn't skimp, delivering yet another visual treat with decadent and vibrant animation\" after their success with Spider-Verse; he highlighted the \"bold and expressive\" character designs which allows Huntr/x to shift from idol protagonists to \"the kind of approachable girls with gremlin-like tendencies\". Toussaint Egan of IGN opined that the film \"knows how to tackle serious subject matter without taking itself too seriously which, along with its stunning production value and exciting action sequences, makes for a wholly entertaining experience\". Goldberg praised Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans \"for understanding that even though their setting may be outlandish, they still have to treat the stakes as real\". Jeff Ewing, for Collider, stated that the film lands \"a beautifully bonkers fantasy premise\" and has \"interesting lore around demons, music, and hunters, which is novel yet feels rich\". Peter Debruge, for Variety, called the film \"fast and efficient\", and while the \"human-demon rom-com plot might be predictable\", he thought KPop Demon Hunters was \"more entertaining\" than Pixar's Elio (2025).\nOn the voice cast, Ewing commented that the actresses for the members of Huntr/x \"have clearly distinct personalities and a strong collective dynamic\", noting that \"May Hong and Ji-young Yoo land Mira and Zoey\" respectively and \"Arden Cho gives a complex and emotional vocal performance as lead Rumi\"; additionally, \"Ahn Hyo-seop is great as the clever, charismatic demon/boy band lead Jinu\". Colbert also praised \"the phenomenal voice work of its main cast\" along with film's authentic \"musicality\" which \"ensures that the songs are so catchy that even the most reluctant K-pop critic would find themselves bobbing their head and humming along to the chorus\". He also commented that the film \"explores music as both a haven and a form of emotional expression\", which is similar to both \"Turning Red and, surprisingly, Sinners\", but noted it stands out by embracing \"the magical girl anime aesthetic\". Wilson Chapman of IndieWire thought the most \"impressive\" aspect of the film's music was how the directors Kang and Appelhans found \"smart, varied ways to stage the songs\" such as a demon fight for \"How It's Done\", a music video \"emulating the high-budget endeavors of real-world groups\" for \"Golden\", a creation montage for \"Takedown\", and a \"spirited dance number\" for \"Soda Pop\". Chapman stated that \"versatility with how it flexes its musical muscles makes the K-pop trappings more than just a goofy gimmick but a central and vital component of its storytelling\". Debruge noted that \"because the nimble, genre-hopping movie is set in the world of K-pop\" the audience might not be aware they are \"watching a musical\". He also highlighted the \"adorable animal sidekicks, which come in the form of a grinning tiger demon and a black bird in a tiny gat (hat), both designed to look like they've stepped straight out of Korean folklore\". Tizzard stated that including the magpie and tiger is not an \"arbitrary flourish\", but are instead \"direct citations from Korea's folk art tradition\" which the film \"reinterprets ... with affection\". Egan highlighted that \"the fight sequences, with their flashy choreography and anime-inflected verve, lean heavily on musical numbers featuring originals songs penned by a who's who list of popular Western artists and Kpop mainstays\" and that it is a \"visually sumptuous action fantasy with the kind of heartfelt chest belters that are sure to make ardent converts of fans of animated musicals\". Tizzard highlighted that the music is \"produced by real industry heavyweights\", stating that \"the music slaps\", it \"is laced with lyrical nuance, and integrates seamlessly with the narrative\". Similarly, Goldberg noted that the \"catchy\" songs have plot stakes which \"helps keep the tension going throughout the film\".\nAngela Garcia of SLUG Magazine opined that due to the short runtime, KPop Demon Hunters \"leaves you feeling like it's only scratched the surface of both the world and characters\". Garcia explained that \"in some ways this is a testament to the enticing world building and likable characters, because the audience wants to know more and spend more time with this story and characters\", however, \"it also shows just how many ideas were here that were ultimately left underdeveloped\". Chapman also highlighted the short runtime, which he felt was both a \"boon at points\" and the film's \"fatal flaw\" – by moving quickly, the film lacks depth at points, such as Mira and Zoey receiving the \"short shrift storyline wise\", \"not digging nearly enough into the resentment Rumi feels towards ... Celine\", and a \"rushed climax\" which is \"slightly underwhelming\" and is \"an overly easy resolution that doesn't give these lovable girls the ending they deserve\". Similarly, Colbert's main criticism was an \"overly convenient\" resolution as the ending was \"so neatly tied up that it loses some of the depth that its setup promised\". Ewing felt the film could have spent more time building \"up the other characters' emotional lives\" and highlighted that the audience is \"a bit shortchanged on Rumi's actually-very-important background\". Goldberg also noted an occasional tonal \"whiplash\" and explained it is \"not so much that the movie needs to discard the emotional elements, but if they were going to head in that direction, then they needed to provide stronger arcs for Zoey and Mira, who largely play as comic relief until the film's climax\". Matthew Belloni of Puck noted that while \"Sony Pictures did make one of the biggest movie sensations of the summer – a project from its animation division that cost more than $100 million to produce and will likely become a billion-dollar franchise\" – the majority of the film's \"value has and will accrue to Netflix\" since \"Sony offloaded it rather than develop it solo and release it in theaters\". Belloni opined that \"this is arguably Netflix's first animated megahit after many, many attempts\" and for \"film chief Dan Lin, this is a studio chairman's dream: a relatively cheap superhit with a clear runway for exploitation across many businesses\", while Sony's film chief Tom Rothman \"gotta be kicking himself over this one\".\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe film's plot explores the power of community and friendship in overcoming cultural pressures. Arden Cho, who voices Rumi, said that \"without Mira and Zoey, she wouldn't have made it\". According to the filmmakers, Rumi's arc parallels the experience of coming out, especially in terms of parental and societal expectations. Co-director Maggie Kang noted that the character's journey was deliberately written to mirror the process of revealing one's true self: \"Rumi's story [is] like she's coming out of the closet and coming clean to her parents who [want] her to be something that she's not\". The final song, \"What It Sounds Like\", serves as a conclusion to the battle between the two fictional bands; while being an \"inspirational pop song\", it also dwells on Rumi's journey on battling her inner demons. Kang commented that when developing the song and Rumi's story they \"talked a lot about mixed heritage\" as well as \"queer identity, and addiction and falling back into addiction. We kind of described the demon part of you\" where someone is hiding part of themselves \"from the world\". Sulman Aziz Mirza, in Psychiatric News, highlighted the focus on \"shame, identity, and healing\" in the film – in particular, Rumi hiding her demonic heritage and patterns \"isolates Rumi in shame, forcing her to skip bonding rituals like bathhouse visits and ultimately silencing her voice\". However, \"Rumi and Jinu, both burdened by shame, begin to heal through music\". Mirza called shame a \"universal\" experience so \"Rumi's patterns could symbolize anything: depression, queerness, trauma, neurodivergence, or being biracial\".\n\n\n== Sequel ==\nIn an interview with Screen Rant, director Maggie Kang expressed interest in a potential sequel and side stories to flesh out the universe of the film. She said that many questions that were raised remain unanswered fully and that \"there are a lot of pockets that we can explore\", such as potential backstories for Mira and Zoey. Director Chris Appelhans told People that \"there are so many unanswered questions, in a good way, and so many avenues that could be their own story.\" Matthew Belloni of Puck noted that, under the 2021 agreement between Sony and Netflix, Sony holds \"the contractual right to produce\" future installments of KPop Demon Hunters; however, \"the follow-up movies will go directly to Netflix, barring the unlikely event of [Netflix] co-C.E.O. Ted Sarandos suddenly coming around on theaters.\"\nIn July 2025, TheWrap reported that, following the success of the film, Netflix has begun considering several potential follow-up projects, including two sequels, a television series, a short film, and a stage musical. In a statement to Newsweek, Netflix Films chairman Dan Lin commented that the company was \"excited to explore what could be the next adventure for Huntrix. KPDH's success comes from its original, fresh story so if we do embark on a sequel, we would want to take our time to make sure that any future stories we tell with our favorite demon hunters retains the flair and uniqueness of the first film\". In August 2025, Belloni reported that Sony had \"just started\" negotiations with Kang and Appelhans \"to return for a follow-up\". On August 26, Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter stated that \"Sony Pictures is in talks with Netflix to make an animated sequel\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nKPop Demon Hunters on Netflix \nKPop Demon Hunters at IMDb",

        "title": "1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre",
        "content": "The Tiananmen Square protests, known within China as the June Fourth Incident, were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, lasting from 15 April to 4 June 1989. After weeks of unsuccessful attempts between the demonstrators and the Chinese government to find a peaceful resolution, the Chinese government deployed troops to occupy the square on the night of 3 June in what is referred to as the Tiananmen Square massacre. The events are sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement, the Tiananmen Square Incident, or the Tiananmen uprising.\nThe protests were precipitated by the death of pro-reform Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989 amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social change in post-Mao China, reflecting anxieties among the people and political elite about the country's future. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation. Although they were highly disorganised and their goals varied, the students called for things like rollback of the removal of iron rice bowl jobs, greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. Workers' protests were generally focused on inflation and the erosion of welfare. These groups united around anti-corruption demands, adjusting economic policies, and protecting social security. At the height of the protests, about one million people assembled in the square.\nAs the protests developed, the authorities responded with both conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership. By May, a student-led hunger strike galvanised support around the country for the demonstrators, and the protests spread to some 400 cities. On 20 May, the State Council declared martial law, and as many as 300,000 troops were mobilised to Beijing. After several weeks of standoffs and violent confrontations between the army and demonstrators left many on both sides severely injured, a meeting held among the CCP's top leadership on 1 June concluded with a decision to clear the square. The troops advanced into central parts of Beijing on the city's major thoroughfares in the early morning hours of 4 June and engaged in bloody clashes with demonstrators attempting to block them, in which many people – demonstrators, bystanders, and soldiers – were killed. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.\nThe event had both short and long term consequences. Western countries imposed arms embargoes on China, and various Western media outlets labeled the crackdown a \"massacre\". In the aftermath of the protests, the Chinese government suppressed other protests around China, carried out mass arrests of protesters which catalysed Operation Yellowbird, strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic and foreign affiliated press, and demoted or purged officials it deemed sympathetic to the protests. The government also invested heavily into creating more effective police riot control units. More broadly, the suppression ended the political reforms begun in 1986 as well as the New Enlightenment movement, and halted the policies of liberalisation of the 1980s, which were only partly resumed after Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour in 1992. Considered a watershed event, reaction to the protests set limits on political expression in China that have lasted up to the present day. The events remain one of the most sensitive and most widely censored topics in China.\n\n\n== Naming ==\n\nThe Chinese government has used numerous names for the event since 1989. As the events unfolded, it was labeled a \"counter revolutionary rebellion\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political turmoil\" and \"1989 storm\".\nOutside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, the crackdown is commonly referred to in Chinese as \"June Fourth Massacre\" (六四屠殺; liù-sì túshā) and \"June Fourth Crackdown\" (六四鎮壓; liù-sì zhènyā). To bypass censorship by the Great Firewall, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May 35th, VIIV (Roman numerals for 6 and 4), Eight Squared (since 82=64) and 8964 (in yymd format).\nIn English, the terms \"Tiananmen Square Massacre\", \"Tiananmen Square Protests\", and \"Tiananmen Square Crackdown\" are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence in Beijing did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square along a stretch of Chang'an Avenue only a few miles long, and especially near the Muxidi area. The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact, they occurred in many cities throughout China.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Boluan Fanzheng and economic reforms ===\n\nThe Cultural Revolution ended with chairman Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the arrest of the Gang of Four. That movement, spearheaded by Mao, had caused severe damage to the country's initially diverse economic and social fabric. As a result, the country was now mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. \nDeng Xiaoping proposed the idea of Boluan Fanzheng (\"bringing order out of chaos\") to correct the mistakes of the Cultural Revolution. He launched a comprehensive programme to reform the Chinese economy (Reforms and Opening-up). Within several years, the country's focus on ideological purity was replaced by a concerted attempt to achieve material prosperity. To oversee his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. Zhao Ziyang was named Premier, the head of government, in September 1980, and Hu Yaobang became CCP General Secretary in 1982.\n\n\n=== Challenges to Reforms and Opening-up ===\nDeng's reforms aimed to decrease the state's role in the economy and gradually allow private production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had been de-collectivized, and 80% of state-owned enterprises were permitted to retain their profits.\nWhile the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems which the changes brought about, including corruption and nepotism on the part of elite party bureaucrats. The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices fixed at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, price fluctuation allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices. Party bureaucrats in charge of economic management had enormous incentives to engage in such arbitrage. Discontent over corruption reached a fever pitch with the public; and many, particularly intellectuals, began to believe that only democratic reform and the rule of law could cure the country's ills.\nFollowing the 1988 meeting at their summer retreat of Beidaihe, the party leadership under Deng agreed to implement a transition to a market-based pricing system. News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying, and hoarding all over China. The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but there was a pronounced impact for much longer. Inflation soared; official indices reported that the Consumer Price Index increased by 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods. Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable state-owned enterprises were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population that relied on the \"iron rice bowl\", i.e., social benefits such as job security, medical care, and subsidised housing.\n\n\n=== Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis ===\n\nIn 1978, reformist leaders had envisioned that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned. On one hand, the massive New Enlightenment movement led by intellectuals promoted a variety of liberal philosophies and values that challenged the socialist ideology, ranging from democracy, humanism, universal values such as freedom and human rights, to Total Westernisation; in response, since the beginning of the reforms, Deng Xiaoping in 1979 proposed the Four Cardinal Principles to limit the political liberalisation. On the other hand, despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment, the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment. The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities. Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered based on nepotism and favoritism. Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in areas under their jurisdiction. Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" (Chinese: 民主沙龙; pinyin: Mínzhǔ Shālóng) and the \"Lawn Salon\" (草地沙龙; Cǎodì Shālóng), began appearing on Beijing university campuses. These organisations motivated the students to get involved politically.\nSimultaneously, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices. Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off. Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor in success. There was widespread public disillusionment concerning the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define \"the correct path\" continued to rest solely in the unelected government's hands.\nThe comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of marketisation and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (\"the right\", led by Hu Yaobang) favored political liberalisation and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (\"the left\", led by Chen Yun) said that the reforms had gone too far and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. Both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.\n\n\n=== 1986 student demonstrations ===\n\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor Fang Lizhi returned from a position at Princeton University and began a personal tour of universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and the separation of powers. Fang was part of a wide undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of China's authoritarian political system and rigid command economy. The view that political reform was the only answer to China's ongoing problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated throughout the country. In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.\nIn December 1986, inspired by Fang and other \"people-power\" movements worldwide, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging and included demands for economic liberalisation, democracy, and the rule of law. While the protests were initially contained in Hefei, where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing, and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.\nGeneral Secretary Hu Yaobang was blamed for showing a \"soft\" attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives and was forced to resign as general secretary on 16 January 1987. The party began the \"Anti-bourgeois liberalisation campaign\", aiming at Hu, political liberalisation, and Western-inspired ideas in general. The campaign stopped student protests and restricted political activity, but Hu remained popular among intellectuals, students, and Communist Party progressives.\n\n\n=== Political reforms ===\n\nOn 18 August 1980, Deng Xiaoping gave a speech titled \"On the Reform of the Party and State Leadership System\" (\"党和国家领导制度改革\") at a full meeting of the CCP Politburo in Beijing, launching political reforms in China. He called for a systematic revision of China's constitution, criticizing bureaucracy, centralistion of power, and patriarchy, while proposing term limits for the leading positions in China and advocating democratic centralism and collective leadership. In December 1982, the fourth and current Constitution of China, known as the 1982 Constitution, was passed by the 5th National People's Congress.\nIn the first half of 1986, Deng repeatedly called for the revival of political reforms, as further economic reforms were hindered by the original political system with an increasing trend of corruption and economic inequality. A five-man committee to study the feasibility of political reform was established in September 1986; the members included Zhao Ziyang, Hu Qili, Tian Jiyun, Bo Yibo and Peng Chong. Deng's intention was to boost administrative efficiency, further separate responsibilities of the Party and the government, and eliminate bureaucracy. Although he spoke in terms of the rule of law and democracy, Deng delimited the reforms within the one-party system and opposed the implementation of Western-style constitutionalism.\nIn October 1987, at the 13th National Congress of the CCP, Zhao Ziyang gave a report drafted by Bao Tong on the political reforms. In his speech titled \"Advance Along the Road of Socialism with Chinese characteristics\" (\"沿着有中国特色的社会主义道路前进\"), Zhao argued that socialism in China was still in its primary stage and, taking Deng's speech in 1980 as a guideline, detailed steps to be taken for political reform, including promoting the rule of law and the separation of powers, imposing de-centralisation, and improving the election system. At this Congress, Zhao was elected to be the CCP General Secretary.\n\n\n== Funding and support ==\n\nDuring the demonstrations, protesters received a significant amount of support from domestic and outside sources. The Chinese University in Hong Kong donated HK$10,000 by early May, and groups such as the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China were founded in support of the protests. Funding also came from the United States, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and countries across Europe.\n\n\n== Beginning of the 1989 protests ==\n\n\n=== Death of Hu Yaobang ===\n\nWhen Hu Yaobang suddenly died of a heart attack on 15 April 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his forced resignation. Hu's death provided the initial impetus for students to gather in large numbers. On university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for honouring Hu's legacy. Within days, most posters were about broader political issues, such as corruption, democracy, and freedom of the press. Small, spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on 15 April around the Monument to the People's Heroes at Tiananmen Square. On the same day, many students at Peking University (PKU) and Tsinghua University erected shrines and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Small, organised student gatherings also took place in Xi'an and Shanghai on 16 April. On 17 April, students at the China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL) made a large wreath to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its wreath-laying ceremony was on 17 April, and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled. At 5 pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the Great Hall of the People, near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds who gave public orations commemorating Hu and discussed social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the Great Hall's operation, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\nStarting on the night of 17 April, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (the Seven Demands) for the government:\n\nAffirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.\nAdmit that the campaigns against spiritual pollution and bourgeois liberalisation had been wrong.\nPublish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.\nAllow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship.\nIncrease funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.\nEnd restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.\nProvide objective coverage of students in official media.\nOn the morning of 18 April, students remained in the square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes, singing patriotic songs and listening to student organizers' impromptu speeches. Others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at Xinhua Gate, the entrance to Zhongnanhai, the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the administration. After police restrained the students from entering the compound, they staged a sit-in. On 19 April, students held aloft a banner that read \"Freedom & Democracy Enlightenment\" on the Monument, under a giant portrait of Hu Yaobang.\nOn 20 April, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumors about police brutality spread quickly. The incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests. Additionally, a group of workers calling themselves the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.\nHu's state funeral took place on 22 April. On the evening of 21 April, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the square was to be closed for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and was attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General Secretary Zhao Ziyang delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, lasting only 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the square.\nSecurity cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall of the People, but several students pressed forward. A few were allowed to cross the police line. Three of these students, Zhou Yongjun, Guo Haifeng, and Zhang Zhiyong, knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier Li Peng. Standing beside them, a fourth student (Wu'erkaixi) made a brief, emotional speech begging for Li Peng to come out and speak with them. The larger number of students still in the square but outside the cordon were at times emotional, shouting demands or slogans and rushing toward police. Wu'erkaixi calmed the crowd as they waited for the Premier to emerge. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a classroom boycott.\nOn 21 April, students began organizing under the banners of formal organisations. On 23 April, in a meeting of around 40 students from 21 universities, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student Zhou Yongjun as chair. Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi also emerged as leaders. The Union then called for a general classroom boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organisation operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.\n\n\n=== Rioting on 22 April ===\nOn 22 April, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in Changsha and Xi'an. In Xi'an, arson by rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities for looting. In Wuhan, university students organised protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government. Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to North Korea on 23 April.\n\n\n=== 26 April Editorial ===\n\nZhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On 24 April, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing and mayor Chen Xitong to gauge the situation at the square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and prominent party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed to take firm action against the protesters. On the morning of 25 April, President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate warning must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations. The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests, and highlighted Deng's having \"final say\" on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\nOn 26 April, the party's official newspaper People's Daily issued a front-page editorial titled \"It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances\". The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt. The editorial invoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric that had been used during the 1976 Tiananmen Incident—an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as \"patriotic\" under Deng's leadership. The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment of the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired: instead of scaring students into submission, it antagonised the students and put them squarely against the government. The editorial's polarizing nature made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.\n\n\n=== 27 April demonstrations ===\n\nOrganized by the Union on 27 April, some 50,000–100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers. The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption\" and \"anti-cronyism\", but \"pro-party\". In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction due to the 26 April editorial.\nThe stunning success of the march forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On 29 April, State Council spokesman Yuan Mu met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident, and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wu'erkaixi refused to attend.\nThe government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory when Zhao Ziyang returned from Pyongyang on 30 April and reasserted his authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and the concession was the only alternative. Zhao asked that the press be allowed to positively report the movement and delivered two sympathetic speeches on 3–4 May. In the speeches, Zhao said that the students' concerns about corruption were legitimate and that the student movement was patriotic in nature. The speeches essentially negated the message presented by 26 April Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on 4 May to commemorate the May Fourth Movement and repeated demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On 4 May, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the classroom boycott. Subsequently, most students began to lose interest in the movement.\n\n\n== Escalation of the protests ==\n\n\n=== Preparing for dialogue ===\n\nThe government was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, tensions between the progressive camp and the conservative camp intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrode all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.\nIn preparation for dialogue, the Union elected representatives to a formal delegation. However, there was some friction as the Union leaders were reluctant to let the delegation unilaterally take control of the movement. The movement was slowed by a change to a more deliberate approach, fractured by internal discord, and increasingly diluted by declining engagement from the student body at large. In this context, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, desired to regain momentum. They also distrusted the government's offers of dialogue, dismissing them as merely a ploy designed to play for time and pacify the students. To break from the moderate and incremental approach now adopted by other major student leaders, these few began calling for a return to more confrontational tactics. They settled on a plan of mobilizing students for a hunger strike that would begin on 13 May. Early attempts to mobilize others to join them met with only modest success until Chai Ling made an emotional appeal on the night before the strike was scheduled to begin.\n\n\n=== Hunger strikes begin ===\n\nStudents began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicised state visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Knowing that Gorbachev's welcoming ceremony was scheduled to be held on the square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought. By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the square.\nInspired by the events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students travelling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the Tiananmen Square demonstration was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their support of the classroom boycott and the protesters' demands. The students sang The Internationale, the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and while at, the square.\nAfraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping ordered the square to be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately. Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism. The students understood that signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation and not just the government. On the morning of 13 May, Yan Mingfu, head of the Communist Party's United Front, called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including Liu Xiaobo, Chen Ziming, and Wang Juntao. Yan said that the government was prepared to hold an immediate dialogue with student representatives. The Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be canceled whether or not the students withdrew—in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.\n\n\n=== Mikhail Gorbachev's visit ===\n\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly from early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by Dai Qing gained permission from Hu Qili to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals in the Guangming Daily. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict. However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by Shen Tong and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the student movement's patriotic nature and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the square. While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally, as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart. Yan then personally went to the square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage. Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the 26 April Editorial and rebranding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused.\nThe students remained in the square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in some 30 years, marked the normalisation of Sino-Soviet relations and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings were derailed by the student movement; this created a major embarrassment (\"loss of face\") for the leadership on the global stage and drove many moderates in government onto a more hardline path. The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the Great Hall of the People amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the square. When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the \"paramount authority\" in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. Zhao's defence against this accusation was that privately informing world leaders that Deng was the true centre of power was standard operating procedure; Li Peng had made nearly identical private statements to US president George H. W. Bush in February 1989. Nevertheless, the statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.\n\n\n=== Gathering momentum ===\nThe hunger strikes galvanised support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17 to 18 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials. Many grassroots Party and Youth League organisations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate. In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng to support the students. The Chinese Red Cross issued a special notice and sent in many personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the square. After the departure of Mikhail Gorbachev, many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, shining an international spotlight on the movement. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.\nThe movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of various sizes occurred in some 400 Chinese cities. Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each having its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy. These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as an appropriate response.\nThe situation seemed intractable, and the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Matters came to a head on 17 May during a Politburo Standing Committee meeting at Deng's residence. At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the 26 April Editorial, was thoroughly criticised. Li Peng, Yao Yilin, and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech to the Asian Development Bank, on 4 May, Zhao had exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students. Deng warned that \"there is no way to back down now without the situation spiraling out of control\", and so \"the decision is to move troops into Beijing to declare martial law\" as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance. To justify martial law, the demonstrators were described as tools of \"bourgeois liberalism\" advocates who were pulling strings behind the scenes, as well as tools of elements within the party who wished to further their personal ambitions. For the rest of his life, Zhao Ziyang maintained that the decision was ultimately in Deng's hands: among the five PSC members present at the meeting, he and Hu Qili opposed the imposition of martial law, Li Peng and Yao Yilin firmly supported it, and Qiao Shi remained carefully neutral and noncommittal. Deng appointed the latter three to carry out the decision.\nOn the evening of 17 May, the PSC met at Zhongnanhai to finalize plans for martial law. At the meeting, Zhao announced that he was ready to \"take leave\", citing he could not bring himself to carry out martial law. The elders in attendance at the meeting, Bo Yibo and Yang Shangkun, urged the PSC to follow Deng's orders. Zhao did not consider the inconclusive PSC vote to have legally binding implications for martial law; Yang Shangkun, in his capacity as Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, mobilised the military to move into the capital.\nLi Peng met with students for the first time on 18 May in an attempt to placate public concern over the hunger strike. During the talks, student leaders again demanded that the government rescind the 26 April Editorial and affirm the student movement as \"patriotic\". Li Peng said the government's main concern was sending the hunger strikers to hospitals. The discussions were confrontational and yielded little substantive progress, but gained student leaders prominent airtime on national television. By this point, those calling for the overthrow of the party and Li Peng and Deng became prominent both in Beijing and in other cities.\n\nIn the early morning of 19 May, Zhao Ziyang went to Tiananmen in what became his political swan song. He was accompanied by Wen Jiabao. Li Peng also went to the square but left shortly thereafter. At 4:50 am Zhao made a speech with a bullhorn to a crowd of students, urging them to end the hunger strike. He told the students that they were still young and urged them to stay healthy and not to sacrifice themselves without due concern for their futures. Zhao's emotional speech was applauded by some students. It would be his last public appearance.\n\n\n=== Surveillance of protesters ===\nStudent leaders were put under close surveillance by the authorities; traffic cameras were used to perform surveillance on the square; and nearby restaurants, and wherever students gathered, were wiretapped. This surveillance led to the identification, capture, and punishment of protest participants. After the massacre, the government did thorough interrogations at work units, institutions, and schools to identify who had been at the protest.\n\n\n=== Outside Beijing ===\n\nOn 19 April, the editors of the World Economic Herald, a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by Yan Jiaqi, which commented favorably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, Jiang Zemin demanded that the article be censored, and many newspapers were printed with a blank page. Jiang then suspended lead editor Qin Benli, his decisive action earning the trust of conservative party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.\nOn 27 May, over 300,000 people in Hong Kong gathered at Happy Valley Racecourse for a gathering called the Concert for Democracy in China (Chinese: 民主歌聲獻中華). Many Hong Kong celebrities sang songs and expressed their support for the students in Beijing. The following day, a procession of 1.5 million people, one fourth of Hong Kong's population, led by Martin Lee, Szeto Wah, and other organisation leaders, paraded through Hong Kong Island. Across the world, especially where ethnic Chinese lived, people gathered and protested. Many governments, including those of the United States and Japan, issued travel warnings against travelling to China.\n\n\n== Military action ==\n\n\n=== Martial law ===\nThe Chinese government declared martial law on 20 May and mobilised at least 30 divisions from five of the country's seven military regions. At least 14 of the PLA's 24 army corps contributed troops. Guangzhou's civil aviation authorities suspended civil airline travel to prepare for transporting military units.\nThe army's initial entry into the capital was blocked in the suburbs by throngs of protesters. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces then retreated to bases outside the city.\nDefying martial law, students entertained themselves with music, drinking, and smoking on the square. At the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganised with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. Hou Dejian suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement but was met with opposition. Meanwhile, Wang Dan moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and its consequences. He advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by hardline student factions who wanted to hold the square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of \"mini-coups\": whoever controlled the loudspeakers was \"in charge\" of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support. Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives, such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement. Some students even tried to oust Chai Ling and Feng Congde from their leadership positions in an attempted kidnapping, an action Chai called a \"well-organised and premeditated plot\".\nUnlike more moderate student leaders, Chai seemed willing to allow the student movement to end in a violent confrontation. In an interview given in late May, Chai stated:\n\nWhat we actually are hoping for is bloodshed, the moment when the government is ready to brazenly butcher the people. Only when the Square is awash with blood will the people of China open their eyes.\nHowever, she felt that she was unable to convince her fellow students of this. She also claimed that her expectation of a violent crackdown was something she had heard from Li Lu and not an idea of her own.\n\n\n=== 1 June ===\n\n\n==== Li Peng's Report ====\nOn 1 June, Li Peng issued a report titled \"On the True Nature of the Turmoil\", which was circulated to every member of the Politburo. The report concludes that the demonstrators' leadership, referred to as a \"tiny minority\", had \"organised and plotted the turmoil\", and that they were using the square as a base to provoke conflict in order to create an international impact. It also maintains that they had formed connections with criminal elements and used funding from foreign and domestic sources to improve their communications equipment and procure weapons.\n\n\n==== MSS Report ====\nOn the same day, another report, issued by Ministry of State Security chief Jia Chunwang, was submitted to the party leadership, and likewise sent to every member of the Politburo, as well as to senior Party elders, including Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian and Chen Yun.\nThe report emphasized the danger of infiltration of bourgeois liberalism into China and the negative effect that Western ideological influence, particularly from the United States, had on the students. The MSS had determined that the United States had infiltrated the student movement by various means, including the use of the U.S. government-owned VOA radio station as an instrument of psychological warfare, as well as the cultivation of pro-American ideologies among Chinese students studying abroad as a long-term strategy. Furthermore, the report also resolved that U.S. intelligence had made efforts to get close to leaders of several Chinese institutions; according to the report, a CIA agent from the U.S. Embassy had nearly fifty contacts between 1981 and 1988, fifteen of whom were associated with the Economic Restructuring Commission. The report advocated for immediate military action, and was viewed as providing one of the best justifications for it.\n\n\n=== 2–3 June ===\nIn conjunction with the plan to clear the square by force, the Politburo received word from army headquarters stating that troops were ready to help stabilize the capital and that they understood the necessity and legality of martial law to overcome the turmoil.\nOn 2 June, with increasing action on the part of protesters, the government saw that it was time to act. Protests broke out as newspapers published articles that called for the students to leave Tiananmen Square and end the movement. Many of the students in the square were not willing to leave and were outraged by the articles. They were also outraged by the Beijing Daily's 1 June article \"Tiananmen, I Cry for You\", which was written by a fellow student who had become disillusioned with the movement, as he thought it was chaotic and disorganised. In response to the articles, thousands of students lined the streets of Beijing to protest against leaving the square.\nThree intellectuals—Liu Xiaobo, Zhou Duo, and Gao Xin—and Taiwanese singer Hou Dejian declared a second hunger strike to revive the movement. After weeks of occupying the square, the students were tired, and internal rifts opened between moderate and hardline student groups. In their declaration speech, the hunger strikers openly criticised the government's suppression of the movement, to remind the students that their cause was worth fighting for and pushing them to continue their occupation of the square.\nOn 2 June, Deng Xiaoping and several party elders met with the three PSC members—Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Yao Yilin—who remained after Zhao Ziyang and Hu Qili had been ousted. The committee members agreed to clear the square so \"the riot can be halted and order be restored to the Capital\". They also agreed that the square needed to be cleared as peacefully as possible; but if protesters did not cooperate, the troops would be authorised to use force to complete the job. That day, state-run newspapers reported that troops were positioned in ten key areas in the city. Units of the 27th, 65th, and 24th armies were secretly moved into the Great Hall of the People on the west side of the square and the Ministry of Public Security compound east of the square.\nOn the evening of 2 June, an accident occurred in which a PAP jeep ran onto a sidewalk, killing three civilian pedestrians and injuring a fourth. This incident sparked fear that the army and the police were trying to advance into Tiananmen Square. Student leaders issued emergency orders to set up roadblocks at major intersections to prevent the entry of troops into the centre of the city.\nOn the morning of 3 June, students and citizens intercepted and questioned a busload of plainclothed soldiers at Xinjiekou. Isolated pockets of soldiers were similarly surrounded and interrogated.\nThe soldiers were beaten by the crowd, as were Beijing security personnel who attempted to aid the soldiers. Some of the soldiers were kidnapped when they attempted to head for the hospital. Several other buses carrying weapons, gear, and supplies were intercepted and boarded around Tiananmen.\nAt 1 pm, a crowd intercepted one of these buses at Liubukou, and several men raised military helmets on bayonets to show the rest of the crowd. \nAt 2:30 pm, a clash broke out between protesters and police. The police attempted to disperse the crowd with tear gas, but demonstrators counterattacked and threw rocks, forcing them to retreat inside the Zhongnanhai compound through the west gate.\nAt 5:30 pm, several thousand troops awaiting orders began to retreat from the Great Hall of the People. That evening, the government leaders continued to monitor the situation.\n\n\n=== 3–4 June ===\nIn the evening on 3 June, the government issued an emergency announcement urging citizens to \"stay off the streets and away from Tiananmen Square\". Meanwhile, protesters made their own broadcasts across various university campuses in Beijing to call for students and citizens to arm themselves and assemble at intersections and the Square.\n\n\n==== Chang'an Avenue ====\n\nOn 3 June, at 8:00 p.m., the 38th Army, led by interim commander Zhang Meiyuan, began to advance from military office compounds in Shijingshan and Fentai District in western Beijing along the western extension of Chang'an Avenue toward the square to the east.  At 9:30 p.m, this army encountered a blockade set up by protesters at Gongzhufen in Haidian District, and made an attempt to break through. Troops armed with anti-riot gear clashed with the protesters and began firing rubber bullets and tear gas, while the protesters in return threw rocks and soda bottles at them. Other troops fired warning shots into the air, which was ineffective. At 10:10 pm, an army officer picked up a megaphone and urged the protesters to disperse.\nAt about 10:30 p.m., still being pummeled by rocks thrown by protesters, the 38th Army troops opened fire with live ammunition. The crowds were stunned that the army was using live ammunition and fell back towards Muxidi Bridge. The troops used expanding bullets, prohibited by international law for use in warfare between countries but not for other uses.\nThe advance of the army was again halted by another blockade at Muxidi, about 5 km west of the square. After protesters repelled an attempt by an anti-riot brigade to storm the bridge, regular troops advanced on the crowd and turned their weapons on them. Soldiers alternated between shooting into the air and firing directly at protesters.  Soldiers raked apartment buildings with gunfire, and some people inside or on their balconies were shot. As the army advanced, fatalities were recorded along Chang'an Avenue. By far, the largest number occurred in the two-mile stretch of road running from Muxidi to Xidan, where \"65 PLA trucks and 47 APCs ... were totally destroyed, and 485 other military vehicles were damaged.\"\nDemonstrators attacked troops with poles, rocks, and molotov cocktails; Jeff Widener reported witnessing rioters setting fire to military vehicles and beating the soldiers inside them to death. On one avenue in western Beijing, anti-government protestors torched a military convoy of more than 100 trucks and armored vehicles. They also hijacked an armored personnel carrier, taking it on a joy ride. These scenes were captured on camera and broadcast by Chinese state television.\nIn the evening, a firefight broke out between soldiers and demonstrators at Shuangjing.\nOn 5 June 1989, The Wall Street Journal reported on the fighting: \"As columns of tanks and tens of thousands of soldiers approached Tiananmen, many troops were set on by angry mobs who screamed, 'Fascists'. Dozens of soldiers were pulled from trucks, severely beaten, and left for dead. At an intersection west of the square, the body of a young soldier, who had been beaten to death, was stripped naked and hung from the side of a bus. Another soldier's corpse was strung up at an intersection east of the square.\"\n\n\n==== Clearing the square ====\nAt the Square, soldiers and students initially attempted to show restraint, but residents refused to follow student orders. Soldiers did not fight back at first after some citizens threw rocks at them.\nIn the early morning on 4 June, the first APC entered Tiananmen Square from Chang'an West Boulevard. Demonstrators attacked the APC with molotov cocktails and immobilised it with a traffic divider, before covering it with gasoline-doused blankets and setting it on fire. Wu Renhua claims that after the three occupants were forced out of the vehicle by the heat, students escorted the three men to a medic station. However, according to other accounts, including an eyewitness account of a Chinese-American reporter, the soldiers were attacked by the crowd: Two soldiers were burned alive inside the APC, and a third was beaten to death in full view of other soldiers. Larry Wortzel, a military intelligence officer at the U.S. Embassy at the time, noted that the demonstrators' swarming tactics were clearly rehearsed and practiced, having been used similarly in other places around the city.\nThe reporter noted that APC incident \"appeared to have sparked the shooting that followed\".\nTroops from the west arrived at the square at about 1:30 am, and troops from other directions gradually arrived as well, blocking main roads to the square to prevent entry. A second emergency announcement from the government was broadcast on loudspeakers:\n\nA severe counterrevolutionary riot has broken out in the capital tonight. Rioters have savagely attacked soldiers of the PLA, have stolen their weapons and burned their vehicles, have erected roadblocks, and have kidnapped officers and soldiers [...] Citizens and students must\nevacuate the Square immediately so that martial law troops can successfully carry out their mission. We cannot guarantee the safety of violators, who will be solely responsible for any consequences.\nAfter the announcement, most people in the square began to leave, and by 2:00 am, there were only a few thousand demonstrators in the square. North of the square, a dozen students and citizens attempted to torch army trucks with cans of gasoline but were arrested.\nAt 3:00 am, Hou Dejian, Liu Xiaobo, Zhou\nDuo, and Gao Xin decided to convince the students to evacuate the square; Chai Ling, however, insisted that \"those who wish to leave may leave, and those who don't may stay.\" The group asked Chai Ling and other student leaders to negotiate a peaceful evacuation. Hou Dejian addressed the students by loudspeaker, urging them to leave the square and surrender their rifles and other weapons, before leaving with Zhou Duo in an ambulance to meet the government troops.\nBetween 3:30 and 3:45 am, the ambulance arrived at the Museum of Chinese History in the northeast corner of the square, and Hou Dejian and Zhou Duo met with Ji Xinguo, a regimental political commissar. They requested that the army give them time to evacuate, and to open a path for them to leave. Ji Xinguo relayed their request to Martial Law Headquarters, who agreed to the students' request. Ji Xinguo informed them of this and told them to exit to the south. After Hou and Zhou returned to the square, they called for an immediate evacuation, and the Martial Law Headquarters announced, \"Students, we appreciate that you will leave the Square voluntarily. Students, please leave in the southeastern direction.\"\nThere was initial reluctance among the students to leave, but as the deadline approached, Feng Congde asked students for a voice vote on whether to stay or leave. Although the vote's results were inconclusive, Feng said the vote to leave was louder. The demonstrators began to evacuate, with students leaving under their school banners, heading southeast. At about 4:35 am, a few minutes after the demonstrators started to retreat, the lights in the square were turned on, and troops began to advance. A squad of commandos charged up the monument and shot out the students' loudspeaker. According to Hou Dejian, tear gas was used during the operation to clear the square.\nAt 5:23 am, a Chinese unit crushed the Goddess of Democracy statue, removing its severed torch first as a memento.\nHaving removed the students from the square, soldiers were ordered to relinquish their ammunition, after which they were allowed a short reprieve, from 7 am to 9 am. The debris left over from the student occupation was either piled and burnt on the square or placed in large plastic bags that were then airlifted away by military helicopters. After the cleanup, the troops stationed at The Great Hall of the People remained confined within for the next nine days. During this time, the soldiers were apparently left to sleep on the floors and were daily supplied a single packet of instant noodles shared between three men.\n\n\n==== In the city ====\nJust past 6 am on 4 June, as a convoy of students who had vacated the square were walking westward in the bicycle lane along Chang'an Avenue back to campus, three tanks pursued them from the square, firing tear gas. One tank was said to have driven through the crowd, killing 11 students and injuring scores of others.\nBy dawn, the sky was enveloped with smoke rising from the centre of the city, and the streets were filled with burned-out vehicles. Skirmishes between protesters and troops continued sporadically in the city. Some demonstrators regrouped and attempted to re-enter the square from the northeast on East Chang'an Avenue, but were driven off by gunfire. The square remained closed to the public for two weeks.\nAt 17:00, a sitrep from the U.S. State Department to the U.S. Embassy indicated that the PLA was \"mopping up isolated resistance\".\n\n\n=== 5 June and the Tank Man ===\n\nOn June 5, having secured the square, the military began to reassert control over thoroughfares through the city, especially Chang'an Avenue. A column of tanks of the 1st Armored Division left the square and, heading east on Chang'an Avenue, came upon a lone protester standing in the middle of the avenue. The brief standoff between the man and the tanks was captured by Western media atop the Beijing Hotel. After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people. Charlie Cole, who was there for Newsweek, claimed that the men were Chinese government agents, while Jan Wong, who was there for The Globe and Mail, thought that they were concerned bystanders.\n\nAlthough the fate of Tank Man following the demonstration is not known, paramount Chinese leader Jiang Zemin stated in 1990 that he did not think the man was killed. Time later named him one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.\nA stopped convoy of 37 APCs on Changan Boulevard at Muxidi was forced to abandon their vehicles after becoming stuck among an assortment of burned-out buses and military vehicles. In addition to occasional incidents of soldiers opening fire on civilians in Beijing, Western news outlets reported clashes between units of the PLA. Late in the afternoon, 26 tanks, three armored personnel carriers, and supporting infantry took up defensive positions facing east at Jianguomen and Fuxingmen overpasses. Shellfire was heard throughout the night, and the next morning a United States Marine in the eastern part of the city reported spotting a damaged armored vehicle that an armor-piercing shell had disabled. The ongoing turmoil in the capital disrupted everyday life flow. No editions of the People's Daily were available in Beijing on 5 June, despite assurances that they had been printed. Many shops, offices, and factories were not able to open, as workers remained in their homes, and public transit services were limited to the subway and suburban bus routes.\nBy and large, the government regained control in the week following the square's military seizure. A political purge followed in which officials responsible for organizing or condoning the protests were removed, and protest leaders were jailed.\n\n\n=== Protests outside Beijing ===\nAfter order was restored in Beijing on 4 June, protests of various sizes continued in some 80 other Chinese cities outside the international press's spotlight. In the British colony of Hong Kong, people again took to wearing black in solidarity with the demonstrators in Beijing. There were also protests in other countries, where many adopted the wearing of black armbands as well.\nIn Shanghai, students marched on the streets on 5 June and erected roadblocks on major thoroughfares. Public transport including railway traffic was blocked. On 6 June, the municipal government tried to clear the rail blockade, but it was met with fierce resistance from the crowds. Several people were killed from being run over by a train. On 7 June, students from major Shanghai universities stormed various campus facilities to erect biers. Although there were rumors of possible martial law in the city, the situation was gradually brought under control without deadly force. The municipal government gained recognition from the top leadership in Beijing for averting a major upheaval.\nIn the interior cities of Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Chengdu, many students continued protests after 4 June, often erecting roadblocks. In Xi'an, students stopped workers from entering factories. In Wuhan, students blocked the Yangtze River Railway bridge and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station. About one thousand students staged a railroad \"sit-in\", and rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike. In Wuhan, the situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a bank run and resorted to panic buying.\n\n\n=== Government's pronouncements ===\n\nAt a news conference on 6 June, State Council spokesperson Yuan Mu announced that based on \"preliminary statistics\", \"nearly 300 people died ... includ[ing] soldiers\", 23 students, \"bad elements who deserve[d] this because of their crimes, and people who were killed by mistake.\" He said the wounded included \"5,000 [police] officers and [soldiers]\" and over \"2,000 civilians, including the handful of lawless ruffians and the onlooking masses who do understand the situation.\" Military spokesperson Zhang Gong stated that no one was killed in Tiananmen Square and no one was run over by tanks in the square.\nOn 9 June, Deng Xiaoping, appearing in public for the first time since the protests began, delivered a speech praising the \"martyrs\" (PLA soldiers who had died). Deng stated that the goal of the student movement was to overthrow the party and the state. Of the protesters, Deng said: \"Their goal is to establish a totally Western-dependent bourgeois republic.\" Deng argued that protesters had complained about corruption to cover their real motive, replacing the socialist system. He said that \"the entire imperialist Western world plans to make all socialist countries discard the socialist road and then bring them under the monopoly of international capital and onto the capitalist road.\"\n\n\n== Death toll ==\n\nFrom the end of the events on, the number of people who died in the square itself has been in dispute. The government actively suppressed discussion of casualty figures immediately after the events, and estimates rely heavily on eyewitness testimony, hospital records, and organised efforts by victims' relatives. As a result, large discrepancies exist among various casualty estimates. Initial estimates ranged from the official figure of a few hundred to several thousand.\n\n\n=== Official figures ===\nOfficial government announcements shortly after the event put the number who died at around 300. At the State Council press conference on 6 June, spokesman Yuan Mu said that \"preliminary tallies\" by the government showed that about 300 civilians and soldiers died, including 23 students from universities in Beijing, along with some people he described as \"ruffians\". Yuan also said some 5,000 soldiers and police were wounded, along with 2,000 civilians. On 19 June, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing reported to the Politburo that the government's confirmed death toll was 241, including 218 civilians (of which 36 were students), 10 PLA soldiers, and 13 People's Armed Police, along with 7,000 wounded. On 30 June, Mayor Chen Xitong said that the number of injured was around 6,000.\n\n\n=== Other estimates ===\n\nOn the morning of 4 June, many estimates of deaths were reported, including from government-affiliated sources. Peking University leaflets circulated on campus suggested a death toll of between two and three thousand. The Chinese Red Cross had given a figure of 2,600 deaths but later denied having given such a figure. The Swiss Ambassador had estimated 2,700. Nicholas D. Kristof of The New York Times wrote on 21 June that \"it seems plausible that about a dozen soldiers and policemen were killed, along with 400 to 800 civilians.\" United States ambassador James Lilley said that, based on visits to hospitals around Beijing, a minimum of several hundred had been killed. A declassified National Security Agency cable filed on the same day estimated 180–500 deaths up to the morning of 4 June. Beijing hospital records compiled shortly after the events recorded at least 478 dead and 920 wounded. Amnesty International's estimates put the number of deaths at between several hundred and close to 1,000, while a Western diplomat who compiled estimates put the number at 300 to 1,000.\nIn a disputed cable sent in the aftermath of the events at Tiananmen, British Ambassador Alan Donald initially claimed, based on information from a \"good friend\" in the State Council of China, that a minimum of 10,000 civilians died, claims which were repeated in a speech by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, but which is an estimated number much higher than other sources provided. After the declassification, former student protest leader Feng Congde pointed out that Donald later revised his estimate to 2,700–3,400 deaths, a number closer to, but still much higher than, other estimates.\n\n\n=== Identifying the dead ===\nThe Tiananmen Mothers, a victims' advocacy group co-founded by Ding Zilin and Zhang Xianling, whose children were killed by the government during the crackdown, have identified 202 victims as of August 2011. In the face of government interference, the group has worked painstakingly to locate victims' families and collect information about the victims. Their tally had grown from 155 in 1999 to 202 in 2011. The list includes four individuals who committed suicide on or after 4 June for reasons related to their involvement in the demonstrations.\nFormer protester Wu Renhua of the Chinese Alliance for Democracy, an overseas group agitating for democratic reform in China, said that he was only able to identify and verify 15 military deaths. Wu asserts that if deaths from events unrelated to demonstrators were removed from the count, only seven deaths among military personnel might be counted as from being \"killed in action\" by rioters.\n\n\n=== Deaths around and in Tiananmen Square itself ===\nGovernment officials have long asserted that no one died in the square in the early morning hours of 4 June, during the \"hold-out\" of students' last batch in the south part of the square. Initially, foreign media reports of a \"massacre\" on the square were prevalent, though subsequently, journalists have acknowledged that most of the deaths occurred outside of the square in western Beijing. Several people who were situated around the square that night, including former Beijing bureau chief of The Washington Post Jay Mathews and CBS correspondent Richard Roth reported that while they had heard sporadic gunfire, they could not find enough evidence to suggest that a massacre took place on the square.\nStudent leader Chai Ling claimed in a speech broadcast on Hong Kong television that she witnessed tanks arrive at the square and crush students who were sleeping in their tents, and added that between 200 and 4000 students died at the square. Ling was joined by fellow student leader Wu'er Kaixi who said he had witnessed 200 students being cut down by gunfire; however, according to Mathews, it was later proven that he had already left the square several hours before the events he claimed to have happened. Taiwan-born Hou Dejian was present in the square to show solidarity with the students and said that he did not see any massacre occurring in the square. He was quoted by Xiaoping Li, a former China dissident to have stated: \"Some people said 200 died in the square, and others claimed that as many as 2,000 died. There were also stories of tanks running over students who were trying to leave. I have to say I did not see any of that. I was in the square until 6:30 in the morning.\"\nIn 2011, three secret cables from the United States embassy in Beijing agreed there was no bloodshed inside Tiananmen Square. Instead, they said Chinese soldiers opened fire on protesters outside the square as they fought their way from the west towards the centre. A Chilean diplomat who had been positioned next to a Red Cross station inside the square told his US counterparts that he did not observe any mass firing of weapons into the crowds in the square itself, although sporadic gunfire was heard. He said that most of the troops who entered the square were armed only with anti-riot gear.\n\n\n== Immediate aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Arrests, punishments, and evacuations ===\n\nOn 13 June 1989, the Beijing Public Security Bureau released an order for the arrest of 21 students they identified as the protest leaders. These 21 most-wanted student leaders were part of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation, which had been instrumental in the Tiananmen Square protests. Though decades have passed, this most-wanted list has never been retracted by the Chinese government.\nOn 17 June, two individuals were captured after exchanging gunfire with soldiers. The same day, a woman who had been visiting a Western diplomat at Jianguomenwai diplomatic compound was observed being arrested by plainclothes policemen.\nThe 21 most-wanted student leaders' faces and descriptions were often broadcast on television. Photographs with biographies of the leaders followed in this order: Wang Dan,\nWuer Kaixi, Liu Gang, Chai Ling, Zhou Fengsuo, Zhai Weimin, Liang Qingdun, Wang Zhengyun, Zheng Xuguang, Ma Shaofang, Yang Tao, Wang Zhixing, Feng Congde, Wang Chaohua, Wang Youcai, Zhang Zhiqing, Zhang Boli, Li Lu, Zhang Ming, Xiong Wei, and Xiong Yan.\nEach of the 21 students faced diverse experiences after their arrests or escapes; while some remain abroad with no intent to return, others have chosen to stay indefinitely, such as Zhang Ming. Only 7 of the 21 were able to escape. Some student leaders, such as Chai Ling and Wuer Kaixi, were able to escape to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other Western nations under Operation Yellowbird, which was organised by Western intelligence agencies such as MI6 and CIA from Hong Kong, a British territory at the time. According to The Washington Post, the operation involved more than 40 people and had its roots in the Alliance in Support of Democratic Movements in China formed in May 1989. After the Beijing protest crackdown, this group drew up an initial list of 40 dissidents they believed could form the nucleus of a \"Chinese democracy movement in exile\".\nThe remaining student leaders were apprehended and incarcerated. Those who escaped, whether in 1989 or after, generally have had difficulty re-entering China up to this day. The Chinese government has preferred to leave the dissidents in exile. Those who attempt to re-enter, such as Wu'er Kaixi, have been simply sent back but not arrested.\nChen Ziming and Wang Juntao were arrested in late 1989 for their involvement in the protests. Chinese authorities alleged they were the \"black hands\" behind the movement. Both Chen and Wang rejected the allegations made against them. They were put on trial in 1990 and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Others, such as Zhang Zhiqing, have essentially disappeared. After his initial arrest in January 1991 and subsequent release, nothing further is known about his situation and where he lives now. Zhang Zhiqing's role and reason for being listed on the 21 most wanted is generally unknown; this is the case for many others on the list, such as Wang Chaohua.\nAccording to the Dui Hua Foundation, citing a provincial government, 1,602 individuals were imprisoned for protest-related activities in early 1989. As of May 2012, at least two remain incarcerated in Beijing, and five others remain unaccounted for. In June 2014, it was reported that Miao Deshun was believed to be the last known prisoner incarcerated for their participation in the protests; he was last heard from a decade ago. All are reported to have mental illnesses.\n\n\n=== Leadership changes ===\n\nThe party leadership expelled Zhao Ziyang from the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). Hu Qili, another PSC member who opposed martial law but abstained from voting, was also removed from the committee. However, he was able to retain his party membership, and after \"changing his opinion\", he was reassigned as deputy minister in the Ministry for Machinery and Electronics Industry. Another reform-minded Chinese leader, Wan Li, was also put under house arrest immediately after he stepped out of his plane at Beijing Capital Airport upon returning from a shortened trip abroad; the authorities declared his detention to be on health grounds. When Wan Li was released from his house arrest after he finally \"changed his opinion\", he, like Qiao Shi, was transferred to a different position with equal rank but a mostly ceremonial role. Several Chinese ambassadors abroad claimed political asylum.\nJiang Zemin, the Party Secretary of Shanghai, was promoted to General Secretary of the Communist Party. Jiang's decisive actions in Shanghai involving the World Economic Herald and his having prevented deadly violence in the city won him support from party elders in Beijing. Having put the new leadership team in place and recognizing his weakened position, Deng Xiaoping himself also bowed out of the party leadership—at least officially—by resigning his last leadership position as Chairman of the Central Military Commission later that year. He kept a low profile until 1992. According to diplomatic cables de-classified by Canada, the Swiss ambassador informed Canadian diplomats in confidence that over several months following the massacre, \"every member of the Politburo Standing Committee has approached him about transferring very significant amounts of money to Swiss bank accounts.\"\nBao Tong, Zhao Ziyang's aide, was the highest-ranking official to be formally charged with a crime connected with 1989 demonstrations. He was convicted in 1992 of \"revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing\" and served seven years in prison. To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators from among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification programme to \"deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalisation\". Four million people were reportedly investigated for their role in the protests. More than 30,000 Communist officers were deployed to assess the \"political reliability\" of more than one million government officials. The authorities arrested tens if not hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Some were seized in broad daylight while they walked in the street; others were arrested at night. Many were jailed or sent to labour camps. They were often denied access to see their families and often put in cells so crowded that not everyone had space to sleep. Dissidents shared cells with murderers and rapists, and torture was not uncommon.\n\n\n=== Media coverage ===\n\n\n==== Official narrative ====\nThe official narrative constructed by the Chinese Communist Party on 4 June Incident states that the use of force was necessary to control \"political turmoil\", and this also ensures the stable society that is necessary for successful economic development. Chinese leaders—including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, who were general secretaries of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party—consistently reiterated the official narrative of the Chinese Communist Party when being asked about the protests by foreign journalists.\nPrint media were required to be consistent with the Chinese government's account of the 4 June Incident. The Chinese government prepared a white paper to explain the government's views on the protests. Later, anonymous people within the Chinese government shipped the files overseas and published the \"Tiananmen Papers\" in 2001. At the 30th anniversary of the 4 June Incident, Wei Fenghe, a general of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said in the Shangri-La Dialogue: \"The 4 June Incident was a turmoil and unrest. The Central Government took decisive measures to calm the unrest and stop the turmoil, and it is because of this decision that the stability within the country can be established. For the past three decades, China has undergone tremendous changes under the leadership of the Communist Party.\"\n\n\n==== Chinese media ====\n\nThe suppression of 4 June marked the end of a period of relative press freedom in China, and media workers—both foreign and domestic—faced heightened restrictions and punishment in the aftermath of the crackdown. State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students. As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts. Two news anchors, Du Xian and Xue Fei, who reported this event on 4 and 5 June, respectively in the daily Xinwen Lianbo broadcast on China Central Television, were fired because they openly emoted in sympathy with the protesters. Wu Xiaoyong, the son of the former foreign minister Wu Xueqian, was removed from the English Programme Department of Chinese Radio International, ostensibly for his sympathies towards protesters. Editors and other staff at the People's Daily, including director Qian Liren and Editor-in-Chief Tan Wenrui, were also sacked because of reports in the paper that were sympathetic towards the protesters.\nThe restrictions were loosened after a few years had passed, especially after Deng Xiaoping's southern tour. Privately run print media then again flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially-run, satellite TV stations sprang up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV. The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organisations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared. This state-sanctioned plurality also created an environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow. To reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were often used by the state as \"approved\" denominations to \"fight against cults\" such as Falun Gong, playing the sects against each other.\n\n\n==== Foreign media ====\n\nWith the imposition of martial law, the Chinese government cut off Western broadcasters' satellite transmissions such as CNN and CBS. Broadcasters tried to defy these orders by reporting via telephone. Video footage was smuggled out of the country, although the only network that was able to record video during the night of 4 June was Televisión Española of Spain (TVE). During the military action, some foreign journalists faced harassment from authorities. CBS correspondent Richard Roth and his cameraman were taken into custody while filing a report from the square via mobile phone.\nSeveral foreign journalists who had covered the crackdown were expelled in the weeks that followed, while others were harassed by authorities or blacklisted from reentering the country. Some were reportedly beaten.\nSome Western outlets withheld certain images from viewers; Graham Earnshaw, a Reuters correspondent at the time, stated that a \"disgusting\" photo depicting the burned body of a soldier hanging from a bus was not sent to subscribers.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\nThe Chinese government's response was widely denounced by Western governments and media.\nAccording to Suisheng Zhao, Asian countries generally remained silent throughout the protests. India's government under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi responded to the massacre by ordering the state television to offer only the absolute minimum coverage of the incident so as not to jeopardize a thawing in relations with China and to empathize with the Chinese government. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) was the only political party in the world to pass a resolution supporting the crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests, calling them \"an imperialist attempt to internally subvert socialism, [which] was successfully thwarted by the CPC and the PLA.\" South Korea was in the midst of efforts to develop relations with the People's Republic of China and President Roh Tae-woo remained quiet in the aftermath of the crackdown.\nFormer United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar expressed great sadness over the event. In 1992, he however stated that the crackdown had been exaggerated, and that he received no convincing evidence of widespread killing.\nCuba, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany, under the Soviet sphere of influence at the time, supported the Chinese government and denounced the protests.\n\n\n== Longer-term impact ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology. This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favor.\nSupport of liberal reform and liberal democracy among intellectuals decreased, and support for conservative cultural politics increased.\nThe protests highlighted severe inadequacies in riot control equipment and training among both the Chinese military and police. The PLA was not trained or equipped to handle riots, and the few PAP riot control units that were dispatched were insufficient in crowd control. Since 1989, efforts have been made to create effective riot control units in Chinese cities increased spending on internal security and to an expanded role for the People's Armed Police in handling protests.\n\n\n=== Economy ===\n\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, many business analysts downgraded their outlook for China's economic future. The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance in the World Trade Organization, which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001. Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4 billion in 1988 to $700 million in 1990. Loans to China were suspended by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and foreign governments; China's credit rating was lowered; tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2 billion to US$1.8 billion; and foreign direct investment commitments were canceled. However, there was a rise in government defence spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline.\nIn the aftermath of the protests, the government sought again to centralize control over the economy, though the changes were short-lived. Sensing that conservative policies had again taken a foothold within the party, Deng, now retired from all of his official positions, launched his southern tour in 1992, visiting various cities in the country's most prosperous regions while advocating for further economic reforms. Partly in response to Deng, by the mid-1990s the country was again pursuing market liberalisation on a scale even greater than those seen in the initial stages of the reforms in the 1980s. Although political liberals were purged from within the party, many of those who were economically liberal remained. The economic shocks caused by the events of 1989, in retrospect, had only a minor and temporary effect on China's economic growth. Indeed, with many previously aggrieved groups now regarding political liberalisation as a lost cause, more of their energy was spent on economic activities. The economy would quickly regain momentum into the 1990s.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen Square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under one country, two systems, following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor Chris Patten tried to expand the franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hongkongers, Tiananmen served as the turning point when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to a sizable exodus of Hong Kongers to Western countries such as Canada and Australia before 1997.\nThere have been large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989, even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. Despite that, the June 4th Museum closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the Hong Kong Alliance, has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location. A virtual version of the museum released online in August 2021 has also been blocked by Chinese telecom companies.\n\nThe events continue to strongly impact perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as \"Chinese\". The events of 4 June are seen as representative of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism, and they are often invoked by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong, especially in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the Tiananmen Square movement's rehabilitation had a tendency to support democratisation in the territory and the election of pro-democracy parties.\nIn memory of the events among other monuments at 1997 Pillar of Shame with height of 8 meters performed by sculptor Jens Galschiøt was placed in the University of Hong Kong. On 22 December 2021, it was removed by the university authorities, a move that was condemned by survivors of the massacre.\n\n\n=== China's image internationally ===\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In the immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a pariah state, increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s, as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution; however, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalisation policies after 1989. From there on, China would work domestically and internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to that of a benign global economic and military partner.\nAlthough the crackdown hurt relations with Western countries, it had relatively little impact on China's relations with its Asian neighbors. Professor Suisheng Zhao, Director of the Centre for China-US Cooperation at the University of Denver, attributes the slight impact to the fact that \"the human rights records in most of these countries were not better than China's. To a certain extent, they were sympathetic to China's struggle against pressures from Western countries.\" Even in the wake of the crackdown, China's foreign relations with its neighbors generally improved.\n\nThe government signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992, the Convention on Chemical Weapons in 1993, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996. Whereas China had been a member of only 30 international organisations in 1986, it was a member of over 50 by 1997. China also sought to diversify its external partnerships, establishing good diplomatic relations with post-Soviet Russia, and welcoming Taiwanese business in lieu of Western investment. China expedited negotiations with the World Trade Organisation and established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea, and others in 1992.\nFurthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing its skilled workers, comparatively low wages, established infrastructure, and sizable consumer base. At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favor of focusing on business interests. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have sometimes paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen in bilateral meetings, but the substance of discussions revolved around business and trade interests.\n\n\n=== European Union and the United States arms embargo ===\n\nThe European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place due to the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\" and damaging to China–European Union relations. In early 2004, French President Jacques Chirac spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, his efforts being supported by German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. However, the passing of the Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China, in March 2005, increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban; and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schröder's successor Angela Merkel opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the embargo lifting when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.\nThe European Parliament has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options in seeking military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former Soviet bloc that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the Sino-Soviet split. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.\n\n\n== Contemporary issues ==\n\n\n=== Censorship in China ===\n\nThe Chinese government continues to forbid discussions about the Tiananmen Square protests and has taken measures to block or censor related information, in an attempt to suppress the public's memory of the Tiananmen Square protests. Textbooks contain little, if any, information about the protests. After the protests, officials banned controversial films and books and shut down many newspapers. Within a year, 12% of all newspapers, 8% of all publishing companies, 13% of all social science periodicals, and more than 150 films were either banned or shut down. The government also announced that it had seized 32 million contraband books and 2.4 million video and audio cassettes. Access to media and Internet resources about the subject are either restricted or blocked by censors. Banned literature and films include Summer Palace, Forbidden City, Collection of June Fourth Poems, The Critical Moment: Li Peng diaries and any writings of Zhao Ziyang or his aide Bao Tong, including Zhao's memoirs.\nPrint media that contain references to the protests must be consistent with the government's version of events. Domestic and foreign journalists are detained, harassed, or threatened, as are their Chinese colleagues and any Chinese citizens who they interview. Thus, Chinese citizens are typically reluctant to speak about the protests because of potentially negative repercussions. Many young people who were born after 1980 are unfamiliar with the events and are therefore apathetic about politics. Youth in China are sometimes unaware of the events, the symbols which are associated with them such as the Tank Man, or the significance of the date of the massacre 4 June itself. Some older intellectuals no longer aspire to implement political change. Instead, they focus on economic issues. Some political prisoners have refused to talk to their children about their involvement in the protests out of fear of putting them at risk.\nWhile public discussions about the events have become socially taboo, private discussions about them continue to occur despite frequent interference and harassment by the authorities. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo remained in China in order to speak out about Tiananmen in the 1990s despite the fact that he received offers of asylum; he faced constant surveillance. Zhang Xianling and Ding Zilin, the mothers of victims who died in 1989, founded the Tiananmen Mothers organisation and were particularly outspoken about the humanitarian aspects of the protests. The authorities mobilize security forces, including members of the People's Armed Police, every year on 4 June in order to prevent public displays of remembrance, with an especially heavy security presence on the anniversaries of major events such as the 20th anniversary of the protests in 2009 and the 25th anniversary of the protests in 2014. On the 30th anniversary of the protests in 2019, the well-known Chinese artist Ai Weiwei wrote that \"autocratic and totalitarian regimes fear facts because they have built their power on unjust foundations\" and he also wrote that memory is important: \"without it there is no such thing as a civilised society or nation\" because \"our past is all we have.\"\nJournalists have frequently been denied entry to the square on the anniversaries of the massacre. Also, the authorities are known to have detained foreign journalists and increase surveillance of prominent human rights activists during this time of year. Internet searches on \"4 June Tiananmen Square\" made within China return censored results or result in temporarily severed server connections. Specific web pages with select keywords are censored while other websites, such as those which support the overseas Chinese democracy movement, are blocked wholesale. The policy is much more stringent with regard to Chinese-language sites than it is with regard to foreign-language ones. Social media censorship is more stringent in the weeks leading up to the anniversaries of the massacre; even oblique references to the protests and seemingly unrelated terms are usually very aggressively patrolled and censored. In January 2006, Google agreed to censor their mainland China site to remove information about Tiananmen and other subjects which are considered sensitive by the authorities. Google withdrew its cooperation on censorship in January 2010.\n\n\n=== Calls for the government to reassess ===\nZhang Shijun, a former soldier who was involved in the military crackdown, published an open letter to President Hu Jintao that sought to have the government reevaluate its position on the protests. He was subsequently arrested.\nAlthough the Chinese government never officially acknowledged relevant accusations when it came to the incident, in 2005 a payment was made to one of the victims' mothers, the first publicised case of the government offering redress to a Tiananmen-related victim's family. The payment was termed a \"hardship assistance\" and was given to Tang Deying (唐德英), whose son Zhou Guocong (simplified Chinese: 周国聪; traditional Chinese: 周國聰) died at age 15 while in police custody in Chengdu on 6 June 1989, two days after the Chinese Army dispersed the Tiananmen protesters. She was reportedly paid CNY70,000 (approximately US$10,250). This has been welcomed by various Chinese activists.\n\n\n=== Chinese leaders voicing regret ===\nBefore his death in 1998, Yang Shangkun told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that 4 June was the most serious mistake committed by the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang himself could not correct, but one that certainly will eventually be corrected. Zhao Ziyang remained under house arrest until his death in 2005. Zhao's aide Bao Tong has repeatedly called on the government to reverse its verdict on the demonstrations. Chen Xitong, the mayor of Beijing, who read the martial law order and was later disgraced by a political scandal, expressed regret in 2012, a year before his death, for the death of innocent civilians. Premier Wen Jiabao reportedly suggested reversing the government's position on Tiananmen in party meetings before he departed from politics in 2013, only to be rebuffed by his colleagues.\n\n\n=== United Nations report ===\nIn 2008, the UN Committee Against Torture expressed concern over the lack of investigations into the reports of people \"killed, arrested or disappeared on or following the 4 June 1989 Beijing suppression.\" It stated that the Chinese government had also failed to inform relatives of those individuals' fate, despite relatives' numerous requests. Meanwhile, those responsible for the use of excessive force had not \"faced any sanction, administrative or criminal.\" The Committee recommended that the Chinese government should take all of those steps, plus \"offer apologies and reparation as appropriate and prosecute those found responsible for excessive use of force, torture and other ill-treatment.\"\nIn December 2009, the Chinese government responded to the committee's recommendations by saying that the government had closed the case concerning the \"political turmoil in the spring and summer of 1989\". It also stated that the \"practice of the past 20 years has made it clear that the timely and decisive measures taken by the Chinese Government at the time were necessary and correct\". It said that the labeling of the \"incident as 'the Democracy Movement'\" is a \"distortion in the nature of the incident\". According to the Chinese government, such observations were \"inconsistent with the Committee's responsibilities\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n1981 Inner Mongolia student protest\n1987–1989 Tibetan unrest\nDecember 9th Movement\nChinese Student Protection Act of 1992\nDemocracy in China\nExecutive Order 12711\nHuman rights in China\nList of massacres in China\nMass incidents in China\nMass killings under communist regimes\nMass surveillance in China\nMoving the Mountain (1994 film)\nProtest and dissent in China\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nLibrary resources in your library and in other libraries about 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre\n\"Assignment: China – Tiananmen Square – US-China Institute\". china.usc.edu.

        "title": "Wednesday (TV series)",
        "content": "Wednesday is an American supernatural mystery comedy television series based on the character Wednesday Addams by Charles Addams. Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, it stars Jenna Ortega as the titular character, with Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan, Percy Hynes White, Emma Myers, Joy Sunday, Georgie Farmer, Naomi J. Ogawa, Christina Ricci, Moosa Mostafa, Steve Buscemi, Isaac Ordonez, Owen Painter, Billie Piper, Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo, Victor Dorobantu, Noah B. Taylor, Evie Templeton, Luis Guzmán, and Catherine Zeta-Jones appearing in supporting roles. Four out of the eight episodes of the first season were directed by Tim Burton, who also was executive producer. The first season revolves around Wednesday Addams, who attempts to solve a murder mystery at her new school.\nBurton was previously approached to direct the 1991 film The Addams Family and was later involved in a canceled stop-motion animated film featuring the Addams Family. In October 2020, he was reported to be helming a television series, which was later given a series order by Netflix. Ortega was cast in part to represent the character's Latina heritage. Ricci, who had played Wednesday in the 1991 film and its 1993 sequel Addams Family Values, was asked by Burton to join the series in a supporting role.\n\nWednesday premiered on November 16, 2022, and was released on Netflix on November 23 to positive reviews from critics; Ortega's performance received critical acclaim. Within three weeks of release, it became the second-most watched English-language Netflix series. It received two Golden Globe nominations: Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy for Ortega. It also won four Primetime Emmy Awards, while receiving nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Ortega. In January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on August 6, 2025; the second half was released on September 3. In July 2025, the series was renewed for a third season. \n\n\n== Premise ==\nWednesday Addams is expelled from her school after dumping live piranhas into the school's pool in retaliation for the boys' water polo team bullying her brother Pugsley. Consequently, her parents Gomez and Morticia Addams transfer her to their high school alma mater Nevermore Academy, a private school that was established for outcasts and monsters, in the town of Jericho, Vermont. Wednesday's cold, emotionless personality and her defiant nature make it difficult for her to connect with her schoolmates and cause her to run afoul of the school's principal, Larissa Weems. However, she discovers she has inherited her mother's psychic abilities, which allow her to solve a local murder mystery.\nIn the second season, Wednesday returns to Nevermore and, while developing her psychic abilities, must face a new tormentor and prevent her roommate's death. In addition, Pugsley enrolls at Nevermore as Weems' successor Barry Dort wants Morticia to take on a fundraising role.\n\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n\n=== Main ===\n\nJenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams, a teenager who possesses psychic powers\nOrtega also plays Goody Addams, Wednesday's deceased ancestor from the 1600s, who appears in her visions\nKarina Váradi (season 1) and Emily Ring (season 2) portray a young Wednesday\nGwendoline Christie as Larissa Weems (season 1; recurring season 2), the shapeshifting principal of Nevermore Academy and a former student who was Morticia's roommate.

In March 2010, it was announced that Illumination Entertainment had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings. The film was planned to be a stop-motion animated film based on Charles Addams's original drawings. Burton was set to co-write, co-produce and possibly direct the film. In July 2013, it was reported that the film was canceled, which, according to Burton, was due to the studio favoring a computer-animated approach over the stop-motion technique.\nShowrunners Miles Millar and Alfred Gough started developing story ideas in 2019. They subsequently acquired the rights to the intellectual property before writing a television pilot script, which they sent to Burton. To their surprise, Burton immediately became interested upon receiving the script. Commenting about his decision to join the project, Burton stated that he could relate to the titular character's worldview and that the script \"spoke to me about how I felt in school and how you feel about your parents, how you feel as a person. It gave the Addams Family a different kind of reality. It was an interesting combination\". Feeling creatively drained after Dumbo (2019), Burton considered retiring from the industry, being left to his own \"feelings and things\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the offer to make Wednesday reconnected his love to filmmaking and served him as a \"health camp\". Millar stated that it was \"very important\" to the creative team not to emulate the prior films and 1964 television series. Millar and Gough decided to make the juxtaposition of \"outcasts\" and \"normies\", as well as criticism of colonial Americans, major themes in the series.\nIn October 2020, Wednesday was initially announced as an unnamed Addams Family project being helmed by Burton. The show's production would be handled by MGM Television, with Burton as director. Gough and Millar would serve as showrunners, while Gough, Millar and Burton would also be executive producers alongside Gail Berman, Jon Glickman and Andrew Mittman. In February 2021, Netflix gave the production a series order consisting of eight episodes. In August 2021, Kayla Alpert was added as an executive producer and 1.21, Tee and Charles Addams Foundation and Glickmania were also producing the series. Deemed his \"first real foray into television\", Burton directed four out of the eight episodes, with Gandja Monteiro and James Marshall directing the remaining episodes. Burton brought on regular collaborator Colleen Atwood as costume designer.\nOn possible future seasons, Gough and Millar commented in an interview with Variety, \"when we sit down to create a show, it's looking at multiple seasons, ideally. That's never expected, but that's the anticipation that hopefully the show is successful.\" They further stated that they had \"a pretty clear runway\" of how future seasons could unfold. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Gough and Millar stated that the second season would expand upon the friendship between Wednesday Addams and Enid Sinclair while also evolving Wednesday's relationship with her mother, Morticia. Ortega stated that the season would \"lean into the horror aspect\" while \"ditching any romantic love interest for Wednesday\". Preparations for a second season commenced in December 2022, following Amazon's acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season, with Ortega now also serving as producer. In July 2025, the series was renewed for a third season.\nA spin-off series centered around Uncle Fester has been in early development on Netflix as of December 2023. As of August 2025, the creators were not treating it as a priority as they were focused instead on production of seasons 2 and 3 of Wednesday.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nThe creative team sought a Latina to play the role of Wednesday Addams to align with character Gomez Addams's heritage, an aspect of the character that was already worked into the series' script. In May 2021, Jenna Ortega, who is of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, was cast in the role. Millar stated that, upon their first Zoom call together, the creative team knew that \"nobody else on this planet\" was better suited to portray the character. Ortega said that she was initially hesitant about joining the project due to her past work in teen-oriented Disney Channel shows and her plans to prioritize film over television work, but decided to join in after meeting Burton through Zoom. In the beginning of August of that year, Luis Guzmán was cast to guest-star as Gomez Addams, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was cast as Morticia Addams in an undisclosed capacity. Later that month, Thora Birch, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan, Georgie Farmer, Moosa Mostafa, Emma Myers, Naomi J. Ogawa, Joy Sunday, and Percy Hynes White were announced to be cast as series regulars. Myers initially auditioned for the titular role before she was cast as Wednesday's roommate Enid Sinclair.\nIn September, Gwendoline Christie and Victor Dorobantu were added to the cast in starring roles while Isaac Ordonez, George Burcea, Tommie Earl Jenkins, Iman Marson, William Houston, Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo, Oliver Watson, Calum Ross and Johnna Dias Watson were cast in recurring roles. In December 2021, Birch left the series, leaving the status of her character, dorm mother Tamara Novak, unclear. In March 2022, it was announced that Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday Addams in the film The Addams Family and its sequel Addams Family Values (1993), was cast as a series regular, replacing Birch in a similar role. Commenting on her casting, Ricci stated, \"I was really flattered to be asked and to be asked by Tim [Burton]\", with whom she had previously collaborated on Sleepy Hollow (1999). Ricci was almost unable to accept the role due to possible scheduling conflicts with Showtime series Yellowjackets. In October, a trailer revealed Fred Armisen to be portraying Uncle Fester and Ricci's role was confirmed as Marilyn Thornhill.\nIn April 2024, Steve Buscemi joined the cast of the second season as the new principal of Nevermore Academy, after previously working with Ortega in Klara and the Sun and with Burton in Big Fish (2003) respectively, alongside Thandiwe Newton in an undisclosed role. In May, the cast for the season was announced, with Buscemi playing Barry Dort, Billie Piper as Isadora Capri, Joanna Lumley as Grandmama, Newton as Dr. Rachael Fairburn, alongside Evie Templeton, Owen Painter, Noah Taylor, Christopher Lloyd, Frances O'Connor, Haley Joel Osment, Heather Matarazzo and Joonas Suotamo in undisclosed roles, while Zeta-Jones, Guzmán, Ordonez and Lewis-Nyawo were promoted to the main cast. In addition, it was announced that Hynes White would not return as Xavier for the second season, due to anonymous sexual assault allegations against the actor which surfaced on Twitter in January 2023. In November, Lady Gaga was cast in an undisclosed role, later disclosed to be the portrayal of Rosaline Rotwood in the second part of Season 2.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPrincipal photography for the first season took place between September 2021 and March 2022 in the Southern Carpathian town of Bușteni, Romania. Filming locations included Cantacuzino Castle, serving as the setting for the fictional Nevermore Academy, Politehnica University of Bucharest, Sinaia railway station, the Bucharest Botanical Garden, Monteoru House and the historic Olga Greceanu Mansion in Dâmbovița County, standing in for the Gates mansion. Exterior shots of Cantacuzino Castle were supplemented with computer-generated imagery. Other settings, including the entire town of Jericho, were constructed at Buftea Studios. Production designer Mark Scruton based his set design primarily on Charles Addams's original cartoons and drew inspiration from Burton-directed films such as Beetlejuice (1988) and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005).\nOrtega called her work on the series \"very stressful and confusing\" and \"the most overwhelming job I've ever had\" due to the production's fast-tracked shooting schedule. To prepare for her role, Ortega learned to play cello and took canoeing, fencing, archery and German lessons. According to actress Joy Sunday, the canoeing lessons were especially strenuous, involving the entire cast and some dozen stuntmen racing each other for an hour daily, with days starting as early as 5:30 am. Ortega avoided talking to Ricci about playing the character during filming to achieve her own unique rendition of the role. She choreographed her dance to the Cramps' \"Goo Goo Muck\" herself, taking inspiration from Siouxsie Sioux, Bob Fosse and goth dance club footage from the 1980s. Ortega sought to make Wednesday's characterization consistent, down to changing lines that she felt were unfitting of the character and with more depth. She stated \"you can't lead a story and have no emotional arc because then it's boring and nobody likes you.\" Scenes featuring Thing, played by Romanian magician Victor Dorobantu, were achieved using a mixture of practical and special effects; Dorobantu wore a blue chroma-key bodysuit that would be edited out in post-production, leaving only his hand exposed. To create the illusion of a severed hand, a prosthetic stump was applied to Dorobantu's hand.\nThe second season began filming in May 2024 in Ireland. Ortega's schedule for the show was discussed with the filmmakers of the Scream franchise prior to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, leading to Ortega's departure from the upcoming Scream 7 (2026) due to the scheduling conflict. Ortega denied this report in April 2025, claiming she instead left because of the departures of Melissa Barrera, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett from that project. By August 2024, they had completed four episodes. Filming wrapped by early December 2024. According to Tourism Ireland, some of the locations used to shoot the new series include Charleville Castle in Co Offaly, Dean's Grange Cemetery in Co Dublin and Ashford Studios in Co Wicklow. The third season is scheduled to begin filming in November 2025.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn December 2021, it was reported that longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman joined the series to compose the original theme and co-compose its score with Chris Bacon. The score features a selection of the series's original score composed by Elfman and Bacon as well as several pop songs, including cello renditions of \"Paint It Black\" by the Rolling Stones, \"Nothing Else Matters\" by Metallica (covered by Apocalyptica) and \"Physical\" by Dua Lipa. The score also incorporates a number of classical works, including The Four Seasons by Antonio Vivaldi, Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto, The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns, Gnossienne No. 1 by Erik Satie and \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.\nLed by two singles, Wednesday's 48-track soundtrack was released by Lakeshore Records on November 23, 2022, and a four-track extended play featuring covers of classical and pop songs was released on November 30. In his review of the series, Tony Sokol of Den of Geek called the score \"a major character, not only thematically, but as an emotional delivery system\", making \"the chills creepier, the jokes funnier and the tingles tangible\". Linda Codega of Gizmodo called the cello segments \"memorable\" and the score \"occasionally-magnificent\". Writing for IGN, Amelia Emberwing described the combination of Elfman's score with Burton's material as \"[going] together like peanut butter and jelly\" and the score overall as \"a stunner\".\nThe second season continued to use a large number of popular hits mixed with classical compositions in the soundtrack. The soundtrack includes \"My Favorite Things\" by the Lennon Sisters, \"Un Mundo Raro\" by Chavela Vargas, \"Tropical Island\" by Barry Lipman Singers, \"Kiss Me\" by Sixpence None the Richer, “Um Oh Ah Yey” by Mamamoo, Prokofiev’s Romeo and Juliet Op. 64, Act 1: Dance of the Knights, \"No Time to Cry\" by the Sisters of Mercy, \"Nevermore Alma Mater\" by Pitch Slaps, and \"Dancing in the Dark\" by Bruce Springsteen. Ortega was portrayed as performing Dance of the Knights on cello for an episode of season two. Lady Gaga released a new song for the second part of season two, titled \"The Dead Dance\", in September 2025.\n\n\n== Release ==\nA first teaser trailer for Wednesday was released on August 17, 2022, followed by a full trailer on October 9 and the unveiling of the series' opening sequence on November 8. Wednesday premiered on November 16, 2022, at Hollywood Legion Theater in Los Angeles. Its eight episodes were released on Netflix on November 23, 2022. In December 2022, Netflix released a promotional video to its Twitter account depicting Thing, a sentient disembodied hand appearing in the series, roaming the streets of New York City and capturing the reactions of passersby. The first season was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment (via Studio Distribution Services joint-venture unit) in March 2024.\nIn April 2025, a trailer for the second season was released. The second season was set to be released in two parts. The first part, consisting of four episodes, premiered on August 6, 2025, while the second part, also consisting of four episodes, premiered on September 3, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Audience viewership ===\nAccording to data from users of TV Time collected by Whip Media, Wednesday had the second-most pre-release followers of any Netflix original series on the platform, behind only The Witcher; it ultimately debuted at number one on Netflix in 83 countries. The series holds the record of most hours viewed in a week for an English-language Netflix series with a total 341 million hours watched in its first week of release, amounting to more than 50 million households, and passing prior record holder Stranger Things 4's 335 million hours. Nielsen Media Research reported a combined watch time of 6 billion minutes within its first week of release, making it the second-biggest streaming week ever recorded by the firm. Three weeks after its release, it became the second-most watched English-language Netflix series in the history of the platform, reaching an estimated 150 million households and totaling 1 billion viewing hours by December 2022. Jacob Stolworthy of The Independent called the series's popularity \"unprecedented\" and suggested that it could jumpstart development of several other spin-off television series.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\n\n==== Season 1 ====\nFor the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 73% approval rating, based on 105 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Wednesday isn't exactly full of woe for viewers, but without Jenna Ortega in the lead, this Addams Family-adjacent series might as well be another CW drama.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 66 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\".\nEd Power of The Daily Telegraph gave Wednesday four out of five stars and called it \"an addictively rococo romp that unfolds like a cross between Euphoria and Hotel Transylvania\". John Anderson of The Wall Street Journal commended Ortega's \"charismatic performance\" and called the series \"often delightful, despite its deliberate darkness\". In his \"B\"-review for The Detroit News, Tom Long deemed the series visually appealing and described Ortega's deadpan as \"just as elastic as it needed to be\" and her performance overall as \"consistently [pushing] outside the caricature enough to keep things lively\". Writing for RogerEbert.com, Cristina Escobar similarly praised Ortega's deadpan humor and commended the series' \"satisfactory\" ending. While finding that the series would not be \"what real fans of Charles Addams and his characters are looking for\", Mike Hale of The New York Times called the series \"tolerable\" despite \"satisfying only on the level of formulaic teenage romance and mystery\" and compared it to the Harry Potter franchise. Commenting on its tone, Jesse Hassenger of TheWrap described the four episodes directed by Burton as feeling more like Veronica Mars than Sleepy Hollow. Nick Hilton of The Independent gave the series two out of five stars and criticized the series's tone as \"relentlessly quippy Gen Z\" and its performances as \"more two-dimensional than the New Yorker comic strip in which the characters first appeared\".\n\n\n==== Season 2 ====\nFor the second season, Rotten Tomatoes gave an 84% approval rating, based on 89 reviews. The website's critics consensus states, \"Wednesday's second season smartly opens up to include more of the whole Addams clan, backing up Jenna Ortega's lovably heartless teenager with an ookier and spookier ensemble.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\".\nLili Loofbourow of The Washington Post said Wednesday's second season is \"tonally darker than its predecessors, and that sometimes feels like a drag on the show, especially when it veers away from the silly high school antics (such as the notorious dance sequence in Season 1). The spin-off suffers from some of the same conceptual instability that plagued the original films, but the latter, being comedies, managed their contradictions with hand-wavy humor.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nFollowing the release of Wednesday, Wednesday Addams's dance from the series and its fan recreations to Lady Gaga's song \"Bloody Mary\" went viral on video sharing service TikTok, with Kim Kardashian, Amelia Dimoldenberg, Marina Diamandis, Madonna and Gaga herself also participating in the trend. This resulted in a large increase in plays of the song on Spotify and on-demand streams in the United States, surging by 415 percent in the week after the series's release. Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva recreated the dance during a December 2022 competition. Earlier that same month, \"Bloody Mary\" was sent to French radio as a single, 11 years after the release of Born This Way, the album it was featured on. The 1981 song \"Goo Goo Muck\" by the Cramps, which plays during the original dance scene, also saw a surge in popularity. According to Billboard, on-demand streams of the song in the United States increased from 2,500 to over 134,000, and Spotify streams increased by 9,500 percent since the series was released. Janelle Zara of The Guardian stated that the viral dance trend \"may have single-handedly revived Gothic subculture for Gen Z\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWednesday on Netflix \nWednesday at IMDb \nWednesday at Metacritic \nWednesday at Rotten Tomatoes \nWednesday at AlloCiné (in French)\nWednesday at Filmfront (in Norwegian)",

        "content": "Alien: Earth is an American science fiction horror television series created by Noah Hawley. It is the first television series in the Alien franchise and is set two years before the events of the 1979 film Alien. The series stars Sydney Chandler, Alex Lawther, Essie Davis, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay, Adarsh Gourav, and Timothy Olyphant in main roles.\nDevelopment for the series was reported to have begun in early 2019, with Ridley Scott attached to executive produce for FX on Hulu. It had started pre-production by April 2023, with Chandler cast in the lead role the following month, and further casting taking place from July to November that year. After principal photography was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production began in July 2023 but was halted in August due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Filming resumed in April 2024 and ended in July that year.\nAlien: Earth premiered on FX and FX on Hulu in the United States and on Disney+ internationally on August 12, 2025.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nThe opening of the first episode introduces the premise of the series as involving three separate destinies for the immortality of mankind.

In December 2020, as part of Disney's Investor Day presentation, the latter television series project was officially announced to be in development for the network, with Noah Hawley as showrunner and Scott as executive producer, being set on Earth in the near future.\nOn February 17, 2022, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that the series is a prequel taking place before the events of Alien (1979). Hawley himself confirmed that the series will be tied more into the style and mythology of the original 1979 film rather than the prequel films Prometheus (2012), and Alien: Covenant (2017). In April 2023, chairman of FX Productions John Landgraf stated that the series was in active pre-production. According to FX Entertainment president Gina Balian, the scale of the production of Alien: Earth was much bigger than that of the 2024 FX series Shōgun, whose budget has been reported as $250 million.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn May 2023, Sydney Chandler was cast in the lead role, followed by Alex Lawther, Samuel Blenkin, Essie Davis, and Adarsh Gourav in July. Timothy Olyphant and David Rysdahl would be among those added to the cast in November 2023.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography was scheduled to begin in March 2022, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production on the series began on July 19, 2023, in Thailand. Filming (without the American cast including Sydney Chandler, Timothy Olyphant, and David Rysdahl) was allowed to occur during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike due to the series' British cast working under an Equity contract. In late August, the production was halted due to the strike with most of the first episode completed. Filming resumed in April 2024, and wrapped in mid-July. Dana Gonzales, Bella Gonzales and Colin Watkinson serve as cinematographers.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe score for the series was composed by Jeff Russo. The soundtrack was released on Hollywood Records on August 12, 2025. The episodes end on famous heavy metal music songs because Hawley decided to highlight the cliffhanger endings by \"mak[ing] an arena show, something that feels bigger than a small theater\", featuring tracks by Black Sabbath, Tool, Metallica and Queens of the Stone Age. The soundtrack from the fifth episode In Space, No One…, released as a stand-alone album on September 2, 2025.\n\n\n== Release ==\nAlien: Earth premiered on FX and FX on Hulu with the first two episodes on August 12, 2025. Subsequent episodes of the eight-episode season will be released weekly. Prior to the series' release, the first episode was shown early to attendees of the series' panel at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 25.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Viewership ===\nThe Walt Disney Company announced that the first episode of Alien: Earth garnered 9.2 million views worldwide within its first six days of streaming. This total was calculated by dividing the total hours watched by the episode's runtime, reflecting viewership on FX, Hulu, and Disney+. Analytics company Samba TV, which gathers viewership data from certain smart TVs and content providers, reported that Alien: Earth was watched by 1.8 million U.S. households during its live-plus-five-day period. Boomer households (ages 65–74) over-indexed in viewership by 8% compared to other demographic groups.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 140 critics' reviews are positive, with a critics consensus of: \"Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 85 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nJames Dyer of Empire gave the first season five out of five stars, praising its exploration of \"the nature of consciousness, mortality, [and] humanity\", concluding that \"Hawley's series is a rare prequel that serves to enrich its source material, breathing new life into a once-tired franchise\". For RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico wrote, \"Tony Gilroy's work on Andor feels like a logical comparison, and that's the quality tier on which this show resides as well. ... [Hawley] delivers an 8-episode first season that somehow marries the philosophical depth that fans of Prometheus admired with the intense action and bone-chilling imagery of James Cameron's Aliens.\" Angie Han of The Hollywood Reporter described it as a \"heady, sprawling, occasionally unwieldy but eventually thrilling epic about personhood, hubris, and of course, the primal pleasure of watching people get absolutely rocked by space monsters\", noting its production design and \"new beasts with their own deliciously horrible ways of killing\".\nNot all reviews were positive. Dominic Baez of The Seattle Times criticized the show's pace and uneven story, writing, \"Its examination of identity ... is less insightful than it wants to be, buckling under the weight of its own unanswered questions. And far too often it feels like two separate plots stitched together, a Frankenstein's monster of existentialism and aliens ripping people apart.\" Nicholas Quah of Vulture called the feeling of the show \"tedious\" and wrote that it \"struggles to resolve the tension between replicating the core Alien appeal and building a broader narrative suited for long-form television,\" at the same time questioning if Hawley is fit for the genre versus his previous neo-noir stylings.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nAlien: Earth at IMDb",

        "content": "Saiyaara (lit. 'Planet'  or 'Wanderer') is a 2025 Indian Hindi-language musical romantic drama film directed by Mohit Suri. Produced by Yash Raj Films, it is loosely based on the 2004 Korean film A Moment to Remember. The film stars debutant Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda in lead roles. It follows Krish Kapoor, a troubled musician, who forms a deep emotional bond with Vaani Batra, a shy poet.\nSaiyaara was released theatrically on 18 July 2025 to positive reviews, with particular praise for Panday and Padda's performances, Suri's direction, and its soundtrack. A major commercial success, the film grossed over ₹576 crore worldwide, emerging as the second highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025, the second highest-grossing Indian film of 2025, and the highest-grossing Indian romantic film.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nVaani awaits her marriage to Mahesh at a court ceremony with her parents and younger brother. However, during the proceedings, she learns over a phone call that Mahesh has abandoned her for the daughter of a wealthy businessman, prioritizing his career over their relationship. Devastated, Vaani faints and subsequently withdraws into depression, isolating herself for months and abandoning her passion for writing.\nKrish Kapoor, an aspiring musician struggling to establish himself, copes with childhood trauma through music. Prone to emotional outbursts, he faces setbacks in his career, including clashes with journalists and disputes with band members. His friend KV supports the band financially, despite the strain it places on his own education. Krish encounters Vaani’s poetry when she applies for a job as a writer at a publishing house and is immediately drawn to the honesty and depth of her work.\nThough initially hesitant about Krish’s erratic nature, Vaani agrees to collaborate with him on a song. When she experiences creative difficulties, Krish discovers torn pages from her notebook, recognizing her inner struggles. To help her, he takes her to a cricket ground, a place of solace for him. Inspired by his focus, Vaani gradually resumes writing. Their collaboration grows into a friendship as they spend more time together, with Vaani regaining her confidence and Krish finding stability in her presence.\nTheir bond deepens when Krish confronts his alcoholic father, blaming him for his mother’s death. Vaani comforts him and later encourages him to admit his father into rehabilitation. After completing their project, Krish distances himself, believing Vaani deserves better, but they soon reunite at a concert, acknowledging their feelings for each other.\nVaani’s parents grow cautious upon noticing Krish’s closeness to their daughter, fearing he may hurt her as Mahesh once did. The stress causes Vaani to collapse, after which her mother questions Krish about his intentions. When he promises commitment, her parents reluctantly approve of the relationship.\nThe couple’s lives change dramatically when Vaani is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Signs of memory loss become apparent, including a breakdown after an encounter with Mahesh. Krish abandons his work commitments to support her, assuring her that he will remain by her side regardless of her condition. On medical advice, Vaani’s parents consider a change of environment, and Krish takes her to Alibaug, where they create new memories together.\nAt a later concert, Mahesh attempts to exploit Vaani’s vulnerability during an episode of confusion. Krish intervenes, but Vaani, unable to recognize him, reacts fearfully. Back at their guesthouse, Krish’s father reconciles with him, urging him not to repeat his mistakes. In a quiet moment, Krish plays the piano while Vaani composes the song “Saiyaara” as a farewell message, though she mistakenly calls him by Mahesh’s name. Soon after, she disappears.\nDespite extensive searches, Vaani is not found. Krish releases “Saiyaara” in her memory, and the song becomes a global hit, propelling him to fame. He continues to carry her writings with him while performing. Months later, KV discovers a viral video showing Vaani in Manali. Krish travels there and locates her at an ashram, where he receives a letter explaining she left to avoid hindering his career. She admits she continues to follow his music from afar.\nWhen Krish meets her, Vaani no longer recognizes him. He reminds her of their shared memories, including their first moments at the cricket ground. Slowly, fragments of her memory return, and she ultimately recalls their love. The film concludes with Krish performing at Wembley Stadium, with Vaani by his side as they marry, signifying their reunion through love, music, and memory.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was officially announced by Mumbai-based Yash Raj Films, with Mohit Suri signed as the director. Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda were cast in the lead roles. For the film's female lead, Suri stressed that he wanted an actress who had not undergone any cosmetic procedures. Principal photography began in September 2024 and concluded in March 2025.\nIn an interview, Suri revealed that the project was initially envisioned by him as a possible third installment in the Aashiqui franchise, but it did not materialize with its producers. Inspired by the Netflix documentary series The Romantics, he began developing the story—titled Saiyaara—independently. However, Akshaye Widhani, the CEO of Yash Raj Films, later came on board to produce and back the film under the YRF banner.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe music album consists of 7 songs, composed by Mithoon, Tanishk Bagchi, Faheem Abdullah, Arslan Nizami, Vishal Mishra, Sachet-Parampara and The Rish (Rishabh Kant), with lyrics written by Irshad Kamil, Mithoon, Rishabh Kant and Raj Shekhar. The background score was composed by John Stewart Eduri, who replaced Suri's norm collaborator Raju Singh. The vocals were provided by Arijit Singh, Jubin Nautiyal, Shreya Ghoshal, Shilpa Rao, Vishal Mishra, Sachet-Parampara, Faheem Abdullah and Hansika Pareek. The soundtrack album was released on 4 July 2025.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe film's teaser was released on 30 May 2025. The trailer was released on 8 July 2025. Panday and Padda did not promote the film before its release, as Suri wanted audiences to experience the pair for the first time on screen.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was cleared with a U/A certificate from the CBFC after a few cuts. Saiyaara was released theatrically on 18 July 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of 31 August 2025, Saiyaara has grossed approximately ₹408.48 crore (US$48 million) domestically and ₹167.73 crore (US$20 million) overseas, for a worldwide gross of ₹576.21 crore (US$68 million). Trade analysts reported that the film achieved a return on investment (ROI) of over 640%, having been produced on a budget of just ₹45 crore (US$5.3 million). The film's box office performance has been described as unprecedented by many trade experts, with The Indian Express noting that it stood out \"at a time when films are struggling to break even, especially the ones starring new faces or debutantes\".\nThe film had a record-breaking opening day, collecting ₹28.75 crore (US$3.4 million) worldwide, marking the highest opening for a Hindi film featuring a debutant male lead.

By the end of its first week, Saiyaara had collected between ₹172.5 crore and ₹175.25 crore (US$20–21 million) net in India, and approximately ₹250.5 crore (US$30 million) worldwide, surpassing Ek Villain to become the highest-grossing film of Mohit Suri's career. On its eighth day, the film maintained momentum, earning ₹17.5 crore (US$2.1 million) net. On 26 July 2025 (its ninth day), it crossed the ₹200 crore (US$24 million) milestone domestically with an additional ₹15.3 crore (US$1.8 million), becoming the second fastest Hindi film of 2025 to enter the ₹200 crore club. The film crossed ₹300 crore mark on its ninth day. Its total stood at ₹220.75 crore net in India and ₹327.74 crore worldwide by the end of day ten. By this point, Saiyaara had already outperformed the lifetime totals of Raid 2, Sitaare Zameen Par and Housefull 5 becoming the second highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025 as well as the third highest-grossing Indian film of the year, behind only Chhaava. This made it the second-biggest opening week for a Hindi release in 2025, behind Chhaava. By its twelfth day of release, the film had earned an estimated ₹270.75 crore (US$32 million) net in India, with a domestic gross of ₹319.5 crore (US$38 million).

Within thirteen days, it had climbed to become the 22nd highest-grossing Hindi film of all time, surpassing RRR and Dhoom 3. By the end of its sixth week, the film had overtaken Padmaavat and Tiger Zinda Hai to emerge as one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 65% of 17 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10.\nTaran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5/5 stars, and wrote \"On the whole, Saiyaara is a stirring musical saga elevated by Mohit Suri's deft direction, heartfelt romance, chart-topping music, and stellar lead performances. Rishil Jogani of Pinkvilla gave 3.5/5 stars, and wrote \"Saiyaara is a beautifully crafted romantic drama that triumphs through its stellar performances, enchanting music, and Mohit Suri's masterful direction. Despite a familiar storyline, the film's emotional depth and heartfelt chemistry make it a must-watch\". Rishabh Suri of the Hindustan Times gave 3.5/5 stars, and wrote \"Overall, Saiyaara may not break new ground in terms of storytelling, but it strikes the right emotional chords. It's a film that understands its audience and delivers with sincerity. It offers just enough to make you feel—and that, sometimes, is more than enough\". Radhika Sharma of NDTV gave the film 3/5 stars, and wrote \"The story is as old as time. Bad boy meets good girl, sparks fly, and then, there's heartbreak, sacrifice, and reunion\". Vinamra Mathur of Firstpost gave 3/5 stars, and wrote \"Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda sail through this messy, imperfect love story\".\nVineeta Kumar of India Today gave 3.5/5 stars, and wrote \"Saiyaara' doesn't promise the best love story or the most dazzling performances. But it holds your hand, sings to your broken heart, and walks with you for a while. It's entertaining, emotional, and musical - a cinematic piece where the flaws are visible, but so is the heart\". Kusumika Das of Times Now gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote, \"The soul of the film lies in the cast's performances. There are flashes of brilliance - lines like \"Mera na hona, tumhare bade hone ka wajah banega\" echo the classic Mohit Suri magic. But overall, Saiyaara feels like it aimed for the stars and only touched the clouds\". Aishwarya Vasudevan of OTTplay gave 3/5 stars, and wrote \"Saiyaara doesn't reinvent the wheel of romance, but it sure makes it spin with heart. While its story may echo familiar chords, the harmony between Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda hits the right notes\". Jaya Dwivedie of India TV gave 3/5 stars, and wrote \"'Saiyaara is a slow-paced love story that tries to reach the hearts of the audience despite its unfamiliarity and incompleteness\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSaiyaara at IMDb\nSaiyaara at Bollywood Hungama",

        "title": "SummerSlam (2025)",
        "content": "The 2025 SummerSlam, also promoted as SummerSlam: New Jersey, was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was the 38th annual SummerSlam and took place as a two-night event on Saturday, August 2, and Sunday, August 3, 2025, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brands. Rapper Cardi B served as the hostess of the event.\nThis marked the first SummerSlam to take place across two nights, which was previously only reserved for WrestleMania since 2020. This was the first SummerSlam to broadcast on Netflix in most international markets after the WWE Network merged under the platform in January 2025 in those areas. This was the third WWE event to be held at MetLife Stadium, after WrestleMania 29 and WrestleMania 35 in 2013 and 2019, respectively. This was the fourth SummerSlam to take place in East Rutherford after the 1989, 1997, and 2007 events. The event also featured John Cena's last appearance at a SummerSlam as an in-ring performer due to his retirement from professional wrestling at the end of 2025.\nThe card comprised a total of 13 matches, with seven on the first night (including an impromptu match) and six on the second. In the main event of Night 1, CM Punk defeated Gunther to win Raw's World Heavyweight Championship, after which, Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated Punk to win the title. In other prominent matches, Tiffany Stratton defeated Jade Cargill to retain SmackDown's WWE Women's Championship and in the opening bout, Roman Reigns and Jey Uso defeated Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. Night 1 also saw the final appearances of Karrion Kross and Scarlett in the company, as both contracts expired on August 10, 2025, and were not renewed.\nIn the main event on Night 2, Cody Rhodes defeated John Cena in a Street Fight to win SmackDown's Undisputed WWE Championship. In other prominent matches, Dominik Mysterio defeated AJ Styles to retain Raw's WWE Intercontinental Championship, The Wyatt Sicks (Dexter Lumis and Joe Gacy) won a Six-Pack Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to retain SmackDown's WWE Tag Team Championship, and in the opening bout, Naomi defeated Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky in a triple threat match to retain Raw's Women's World Championship. The second night of the event was notable for the surprise return of Brock Lesnar, who had been on hiatus from WWE since the 2023 edition of SummerSlam.\nThe event received mostly positive reviews, with the main events of both nights being universally acclaimed, whilst the first night's opening tag team match, the TLC match, the Women's World Championship match, the Women's Intercontinental Championship match, and Jelly Roll's performance during his bout garnered widespread praise. Criticism was majorly directed towards the return of Lesnar amidst his involvement in the Vince McMahon sex trafficking scandal.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nSummerSlam is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event traditionally held in August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the \"Big Five\". Out of the five, it is considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania.\nOn September 26, 2024, in conjunction with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA), WWE announced the 38th SummerSlam, scheduled to be held across two nights on Saturday, August 2, and Sunday, August 3, 2025, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey with a special start time of 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) for both nights. MetLife Stadium previously hosted WrestleMania 29 and WrestleMania 35 in 2013 and 2019, respectively, and this is the fourth SummerSlam in East Rutherford, after the 1989, 1997, and 2007 events. This would also be the first two-night SummerSlam, though WWE had previously announced that the event would expand to two nights beginning with the 2026 edition in Minneapolis. Previously, only WrestleMania had been held as a two-night WWE event since WrestleMania 36 in 2020 (originally done as a precaution due to the COVID-19 pandemic before becoming permanent with WrestleMania 37 the following year). The event features wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions, with rapper Cardi B serving as the event's hostess.\nTo help secure the event, NJSEA committed US$7.125 million from New Jersey's allotment of federal funds under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP), specifically from a fund intended to provide aid to industries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel and tourism. NJSEA said it expected the event to generate US$80 million in economic impact for the region. Bergen newspaper The Record reported that the US$6.24 billion in total funds New Jersey received under the ARP had to be allocated by the end of 2024 and spent before the end of 2026, and noted there was \"still money to be used\".\nDuring SummerSlam weekend, WWE partnered with independent wrestling promotion Game Changer Wrestling (GCW) to co-promote a WWE ID Showcase event on August 1 at The Williams Center in Rutherford, New Jersey, which saw the inaugural Men's WWE ID and Women's ID Champions crowned. WWE had also scheduled a comedy event called WWE Late Night, which was to be hosted by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in Englewood, New Jersey after SummerSlam Saturday's conclusion; however, on July 25, ticket holders were notified that the event was cancelled and refunds would be issued.\n\n\n=== Broadcast outlets ===\nIn addition to airing on traditional PPV worldwide, SummerSlam was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States, Netflix in most international markets, and the WWE Network in any remaining countries that had not yet transferred to Netflix due to pre-existing contracts. This marked the first SummerSlam to livestream on Netflix following the WWE Network's merger under the service in January 2025 in those areas. The select few territories that still have the standalone WWE Network will eventually merge under Netflix once the pre-existing contracts expire. This was also the last SummerSlam to air on Peacock in the United States, as ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming service began broadcasting WWE's main roster livestreaming events beginning with September's Wrestlepalooza after Peacock's contract (based on number of events per year, not necessarily a defined length of time) expired in August following Clash in Paris. WWE also partnered with Fandango to broadcast WWE's PPV and livestreaming events in select theaters across the United States, beginning with the 2025 SummerSlam, which was exclusive to select Regal Cinemas, with events after SummerSlam expanding to other theater chains.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nNight 1's card had seven matches, including one impromptu one, while Night 2 included six, for a total of 13 matches, which resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television programs, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.\n\n\n==== Main event matches ====\n\nAt Night of Champions, the King and Queen of the Ring finals took place, with the winners receiving a match for the world championship of their respective brand at SummerSlam. The King of the Ring final was won by SmackDown's Cody Rhodes, while in the main event of Night of Champions, John Cena retained SmackDown's Undisputed WWE Championship; this confirmed that Rhodes would challenge Cena for the title at SummerSlam, setting up a rematch from the main event of Night 2 of WrestleMania 41 where Cena had controversially defeated Rhodes to win the title. During the contract signing on the July 18 episode of SmackDown, Cena feigned that he was not ready to defend the title and refused signing the contract so that he would not have to face Rhodes at SummerSlam, after which, a brawl ensued which ended with Rhodes forcing Cena to sign the contract and subsequently then revealed the fine print, which was that their match would be a Street Fight. On the final SmackDown before SummerSlam, Cena seemingly turned face, stating that Rhodes's actions knocked sense into him and that he should have never turned heel.\n\nOn the July 14 episode of Raw, a gauntlet match was held to determine who would face Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam. The match was won by CM Punk.\n\n\n==== Undercard matches ====\nThe Queen of the Ring final at Night of Champions was won by SmackDown's Jade Cargill. Subsequently, at Evolution the following month, Tiffany Stratton retained SmackDown's WWE Women's Championship, thus confirming that Cargill would challenge Stratton for the title at SummerSlam.\n\nOn the July 4 episode of SmackDown, Drew McIntyre made a return in his first appearance since Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIX interrupting Randy Orton, and taunted him for not punting Cody Rhodes's head in the final of the King of the Ring tournament at Night of Champions, stating that the legend of Orton was dead; Orton responded by performing an RKO on McIntyre. On the following episode while country singer Jelly Roll was performing his song \"Liar\", he was interrupted by Logan Paul, who stated that no one wanted to see an outsider in WWE. Orton interrupted, demanding that Paul show respect to Roll. McIntyre appeared and performed a Claymore Kick on Orton. Paul then attacked Orton further only for Roll to intervene. Paul then dismantled Roll's music set. The next evening at Saturday Night's Main Event XL, Orton, who was accompanied by Roll, defeated McIntyre, who was accompanied by Paul. Following the match, Paul attacked Orton, which prompted Roll to attack Paul, only for McIntyre to attack Roll with a Claymore Kick. Later, Roll stated that he wanted both McIntyre and Paul in a match, with Orton suggesting that the match should take place at SummerSlam. It was subsequently confirmed that Roll and Orton would face McIntyre and Paul in a tag team match at the event.\n\nAt Evolution, SmackDown's Naomi cashed in her Money in the Bank contract during a singles match between champion Iyo Sky and Rhea Ripley, converting it into a triple threat match to win Raw's Women's World Championship; Naomi was subsequently transferred to the Raw brand. During Naomi's celebration on Raw the following night, both Sky and Ripley interrupted, wanting another title match. Raw General Manager Adam Pearce then announced that Naomi would defend the title against both Ripley and Sky in a triple threat match at SummerSlam.\nAt Evolution, Becky Lynch defeated Bayley and Lyra Valkyria to retain the WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship in a triple threat match. The next night on Raw, Valkyria defeated Bayley in a two out of three falls match to earn a rematch against Lynch for the title at SummerSlam. On the following episode, Lynch proposed for the match stipulation to be a Last Chance match in which Valkyria would never be able to challenge for the title again for as long as Lynch was champion, the same stipulation from Money In the Bank where Lynch had defeated Valkyria to win the title. Valkyria accepted and added that the match should be a No Disqualification, No Countout match to guarantee a winner, which Lynch accepted.\nAfter failing to win the WWE Women's Championship at WrestleMania 41, Charlotte Flair was approached by former rival Alexa Bliss, who suggested the two form a tag team, with Flair declining several times before eventually agreeing. At Evolution, Bliss and Flair were part of a fatal four-way tag team match for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, where champions The Judgment Day (Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez) retained, although neither Bliss or Flair were pinned. On the following episode of SmackDown, Flair announced that after speaking with Raw General Manager Adam Pearce, who was filling in for SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis that night, she and Bliss would face Rodriguez and Perez for the title at SummerSlam.\nAt Night of Champions, Solo Sikoa defeated Jacob Fatu to win the WWE United States Championship after interference from JC Mateo, a returning Tonga Loa, and a debuting Talla Tonga. On the July 4 episode of SmackDown, Fatu defeat Mateo and Sikoa in a tag team match, with Fatu pinning Sikoa. Two weeks later, Fatu was taken by police after an alleged involvement in a car accident involving Sikoa's group (kayfabe), however, later that night, Fatu returned. Following an altercation between Fatu and Sikoa's group, Raw General Manager Adam Pearce, who was filling in for SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis that night, announced that Sikoa would defend the championship against Fatu in a Steel Cage match at SummerSlam. Sikoa in turn was taken by the police after allegedly faking the car accident.\nDominik Mysterio was originally scheduled to defend the WWE Intercontinental Championship against AJ Styles at Night of Champions; however, as a result of an injury sustained by Mysterio, the match was postponed. Over the following weeks, Mysterio continued to avoid wrestling Styles, claiming that he was not medically cleared. However, on the July 14 episode of Raw, Raw General Manager Adam Pearce announced that on the following episode, Mysterio would be re-evaluated by the medical team, and if Mysterio was cleared to compete, he would defend the championship against Styles at SummerSlam. On the next episode, Mysterio continually evaded re-evaluation, however, Pearce stated that if Mysterio was not re-evaluated, he would be stripped of the Intercontinental Championship. Later, Mysterio attacked Styles, before announcing that he was medically cleared to compete, confirming that he would defend the title against Styles at SummerSlam.\n\nIn the main event of Night 1 of WrestleMania 41, Roman Reigns's special counsel Paul Heyman accompanied his former client CM Punk to the ring as a favor for Punk teaming with Reigns at Survivor Series: WarGames in November 2024, much to Reigns's dismay. However, Heyman betrayed both Reigns and Punk, siding with Seth Rollins and assisted Rollins in winning the match. On the following episode of Raw, Bron Breakker was added to Rollins's alliance and attacked Reigns, with him subsequently taking a hiatus over the next couple of months, during which Bronson Reed, who had been on the losing team against Reigns and Punk's team at Survivor Series: WarGames, was also added to Rollins's alliance. Rollins, however, suffered a knee injury at Saturday Night's Main Event XL on July 12. On the July 14 episode of Raw, Breakker and Reed attacked Punk and Reigns's cousin Jey Uso after their gauntlet match, however, Reigns returned from hiatus and attacked Reed and Breakker. The following week, Reigns chastised Heyman for his betrayal, only to be attacked by Breakker and Reed. However, Uso appeared and assisted Reigns. In a video message posted on X on July 22, Reigns proposed a tag team match between himself and Uso against Breakker and Reed at SummerSlam. Uso subsequently accepted and the match was made official.\nSince early 2025, Karrion Kross had been playing mind games with Sami Zayn, believing that Zayn was a liar and not the good guy he portrayed himself to be due to Zayn's past as a heel. This came to a head at Night of Champions where Zayn defeated Kross. On the following episode of Raw, Kross attacked Zayn with a pipe, which costed Zayn a tag team match later that night. The following week, Kross further targeted Zayn and attempted to once again strike Zayn with the pipe, however, he was stopped by Raw General Manager Adam Pearce and some WWE personnel. This in turn cost Zayn another match. Kross then defeated Zayn on the July 21 episode after striking Zayn with the pipe once again. On July 25 during a SummerSlam card reveal event, it was announced that they would have a rematch at SummerSlam. On the final Raw before SummerSlam, both agreed that if Kross won, Zayn would have to admit that Kross was right about Zayn, but if Zayn won, Kross would have to admit that he was wrong about Zayn.\nOn the May 23 episode of SmackDown, The Wyatt Sicks (Uncle Howdy, Dexter Lumis, Erick Rowan, Joe Gacy, and Nikki Cross) made a surprise return after being on hiatus since December 2024, attacking both Fraxiom (Axiom and Nathan Frazer) and WWE Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) during their championship defense, ending the match in a no-contest. The following week, The Wyatt Sicks continued to target the tag team division, again attacking Fraxiom and The Street Profits, as well as Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa). Lumis and Gacy then defeated Motor City Machine Guns on the June 13 episode, and proceeded to a match for the title two weeks later, which ended in a no-contest after the aforementioned teams and Los Garzas (Angel and Berto) interfered. On the July 4 episode, The Wyatt Sicks defeated Ford, Gargano, Sabin, and Berto in an eight-man tag team match, earning another championship match the following week, where Lumis and Gacy defeated The Street Profits to win the title, much to the dismay of the other teams, who wanted to prevent the championship from going to The Wyatt Sicks. The following week, the newly formed tag team of Andrade and Rey Fenix defeated #DIY, Motor City Machine Guns, and Fraxiom to become the number one contenders the following week, where the match ended in a no-contest after Cross pulled the referee out of the ring during a pin. After a brawl between The Wyatt Sicks, Andrade and Fénix, #DIY, Fraxiom, Motor City Machine Guns, and The Street Profits, SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis announced that The Wyatt Sicks would defend the WWE Tag Team Championship against the five other teams in a Six-Pack Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at SummerSlam.\n\n\n== Event ==\n\n\n=== Night 1 ===\n\n\n==== Preliminary matches ====\nSummerSlam Saturday began with Singer and rapper Breland singing \"God Bless America\".

Uso then performed a superkick on Breakker and then performed a Spear and an Uso Splash on Reed to win the match.\n\nNext, Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez defended the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against Alexa Bliss and Charlotte Flair. During the match, as Flair applied the Figure Eight Leglock on Rodriguez, Bliss attempted to attack Rodriguez, who evaded Bliss, causing Bliss to accidentally strike Flair. In the closing moments, Flair performed a big boot on Rodriguez and Bliss performed a Sister Abigail DDT on Perez to win the title.\nAfter that, Sami Zayn took on Karrion Kross (accompanied by Scarlett). During the match, Zayn performed a Blue Thunder Bomb on Kross. Scarlett tossed a pipe at Zayn's feet and a conflicted Zayn grabbed it, ready to strike Kross with it, however, Zayn refused and Kross rolled up Zayn for a nearfall. In the closing moments, Zayn then performed an Exploder Suplex and a Helluva Kick on Kross to win the match. This was the final WWE appearance for both Kross and Scarlett before their contracts expired on August 11.\nIn the fourth match, Tiffany Stratton defended the WWE Women's Championship against Jade Cargill. During the match, Cargill performed Jaded on Stratton, who placed her foot on the middle rope to void the pin attempt.

In the closing moments, Punk escaped the submission and performed the Go To Sleep twice on Gunther to win the title.\nFollowing the match, Money in the Bank contract holder Seth Rollins, sporting crutches and a brace on his right knee, arrived with Paul Heyman and sent a warning shot to Punk. Rollins turned around to exit the stage and paused momentarily before dropping his crutches and removing his brace, thus revealing that he was faking his injury, grabbing his briefcase from Heyman, and running to the ring. As Punk attempted a Go To Sleep, Rollins countered and attacked Punk with the briefcase. Rollins then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and performed a Stomp on Punk to win the title. Rollins then celebrated with Heyman, Bron Breakker, and Bronson Reed. Post-match, the commentators described Rollins' cash-in as \"the ruse of the century\".

In the end, as Cena attempted an Avalanche Attitude Adjustment on Rhodes through a table, Rhodes countered and performed a Cody Cutter through a table. As Cena struggled to stand, Rhodes saluted Cena and then pinned him following Cross Rhodes to win the title.\nAfter the match, Cena picked up the title and handed it to Rhodes, and the two embraced, solidifying Cena's face turn. Rhodes left the ring to let Cena thank the fans. Brock Lesnar then returned for the first time since the 2023 SummerSlam event with a crowd stunning reaction. Cena attempted a clothesline on Lesnar, who ducked and countered with an F-5.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe event received mostly positive reviews, with the main events of both nights being universally acclaimed. Shakiel Mahjouri of CBS Sports gave the main event of Night 1 a grade of A, remarking that \"the talented wrestlers evoked an old school match rife with psychology, chain wrestling and rugged strikes\", He called it \"the best match by a mile on a mostly stale card\" and that \"Punk and Gunther executed a slow burn with a great finish\". Talking about Seth Rollins's Money in the Bank cash-in, he said that he was \"mixed\" on its execution, but stated that \"Rollins did a fantastic job faking his injury\" and that the cash-in \"wasn't a shocker by any stretch, but a dramatic conclusion to SummerSlam Night 1 and an important commitment to Rollins' push\". John Canton of TJR Wrestling gave it a rating of four stars out of five, and wrote in his review \"I liked the match quite a bit. I wouldn’t call it a Match of the Year or anything like that, but a four-star main event is nice to see\", and that \"from a storytelling standpoint, I thought they did an excellent job\". He called the cash-in \"something that a lot of us expected\" and that \"they played it perfectly, and it worked\". Overall, he rated SummerSlam Saturday event 7.5 out of 10.\nReviewing the main event of Night 2, Erik Beaston of Bleacher Report graded the match an A+, analysing it as \"an all-timer; a Match of the Year candidate that ranks as one of the best in either man's long lineage of excellence\". Beaston called it \"Cena's best performance since his series of matches against AJ Styles in 2016-17 and was on a par with Rhodes' recent classics against Reigns and Styles\". Pro Wrestling Torch's Wade Keller called it \"way above expectations\" and \"a strong performance from Cena and Cody\". Jason Powell of Pro Wrestling Dot Net wrote \"[Cena] worked hard and put together a hell of a brawl with Cody\" and \"it was much better than I anticipated\". Brent Brookhouse of CBS Sports graded it a B, saying that \"it was a good match for Cena and was far, far better than their disaster of a match at WrestleMania\". Canton rated the match five stars out of five, stating that \"it was an excellent match that was easily Cena's best singles match this year\". He said that \"this was a classic Cena PLE main event match and to John's credit, he put on an epic performance\", and that \"Cody winning was the right call because it was great to see Cena as a 17-time WWE World Champion, but I felt like he should lose the title before retiring and putting the title back on Cody makes a lot of sense\". Overall, Canton rated SummerSlam Sunday 8.5 out of 10.\nWriting for the Wrestling Observer Newsletter for Night 1, professional wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer rated Roman Reigns and Jey Uso vs. Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed four stars, the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship match three stars, Sami Zayn vs. Karrion Kross 1.5 stars (the lowest rated match across both nights), the WWE Women's Championship match two stars, Randy Orton and Jelly Roll vs. Drew McIntyre and Logan Paul 3.75 stars, and the World Heavyweight Championship bout between Gunther and CM Punk 4.5 stars.

Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter revealed that Lesnar had been cleared to return in the weeks leading up to the event and that his return is why a post-show press conference was not held. Chief content officer Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque stated that a feud with Lesnar was John Cena's \"wish\", although this was disputed by Meltzer and fellow journalist Bryan Alvarez.\nFollowing the event, a representative of Janel Grant, the subject of the sex trafficking scandal, released a statement saying:\n\n \"For far too long, abuse was allowed to thrive under WWE's leadership. Instead of righting this wrong, WWE has done nothing to ensure those responsible are held accountable. This attempt to sweep misconduct under the rug will backfire. We look forward to the full set of facts, including those about Mr. Lesnar, coming out in a court of law where they belong but, in the meantime, we refer you back to Janel Grant's updated complaint, which outlines, in detail, the abuse she endured by McMahon and others while employed at WWE.\" She also shared revised sections of Grant's lawsuit which named Brock Lesnar, and alleged that McMahon had arranged for Lesnar to receive explicit content of Grant as an incentive to sign a new deal with WWE in 2021.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn August 6, 2025, WWE announced that ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming service would assume the streaming rights of WWE's events in the United States beginning in April 2026. As such, this was the last SummerSlam to livestream on Peacock.\n\n\n=== Raw ===\nNew World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins (accompanied by Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed, and Paul Heyman, now known as The Vision) opened the following episode of Raw to talk about his Money in the Bank cash-in. LA Knight interrupted, citing his win over Rollins at Saturday Night's Main Event XL after Rollins got injured. A match between Rollins and Knight for the title was scheduled for the main event with Breakker and Reed banned from ringside, which Rollins won by disqualification after CM Punk interfered and attacked Rollins. Afterwards, Breakker and Reed attacked Knight and Punk until Roman Reigns made the save. However, Rollins stood tall after laying out Reigns with a stomp, followed by a spear by Breakker and a trio of Tsunamis by Reed. The following week, Punk and Knight defeated Breakker and Reed via disqualification after Rollins attacked Punk. Jey Uso then appeared to help Knight and Punk, brawling with The Vision. Raw General Manager Adam Pearce then announced that Rollins would defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Punk, Knight, and Uso in a fatal four-way match at Clash in Paris. The following week on the August 18 episode, Rollins and Reed attempted to interfere in an Extreme Rules match between Uso and Breakker on the latter's behalf, only to be thwarted by a returning Reigns. Reigns subsequently issued a challenge for a match against Reed at Clash in Paris, which Reed accepted.\nAlso on Raw, Alexa Bliss and Charlotte Flair celebrated their WWE Women's Tag Team Championship win. Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez interrupted, setting up a title rematch, where Bliss and Flair retained.\nRhea Ripley wished Iyo Sky luck on her upcoming match against Naomi for the Women's World Championship on the August 11 episode of Raw. However, the match never happened as Naomi was not medically cleared to compete. It was subsequently revealed the following week that Naomi was legitimately pregnant with her first child, and that she would be taking maternity leave, thus vacating the title.\nA rematch between Dominik Mysterio and AJ Styles for the Intercontinental Championship was scheduled for the September 1 episode of Raw, where Mysterio retained after interference by El Grande Americano.\n\n\n=== SmackDown ===\nJohn Cena opened the following episode of SmackDown, addressing his loss at SummerSlam and subsequent assault by Brock Lesnar before Logan Paul interrupted. Following an exchange of words a match between Cena and Paul was scheduled for Clash in Paris. Paul and Drew McIntyre then attacked Cena until new Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes made the save. This led to a tag team match where Cena and Rhodes defeated Paul and McIntyre via disqualification after Paul attacked Cena with a low blow. After the match, Cena and Paul brawled to the backstage while Rhodes and McIntyre fought ringside. McIntyre struck Rhodes with the WWE title belt and stared at it. McIntyre then hit a Claymore Kick on Rhodes through the side of the announce table.\nAfter SummerSlam, Jade Cargill wanted another shot at Tiffany Stratton's WWE Women's Championship, and they both won a tag team match on the August 22 episode of SmackDown with Cargill making the pin. Because of that, Cargill was subsequently named the number one contender for the title the following week.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "title": "Google",
        "content": "Google LLC ( , GOO-gəl) is an American multinational corporation and technology company focusing on online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, consumer electronics, and artificial intelligence (AI). It has been referred to as \"the most powerful company in the world\" by the BBC and is one of the world's most valuable brands. Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., is one of the five Big Tech companies alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.\nGoogle was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.\nAfter the success of its original service, Google Search (often known simply as \"Google\"), the company has rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation and mapping (Waze, Maps, and Earth), cloud computing (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android and ChromeOS), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), videotelephony (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch and Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), AI (Google Assistant and Gemini), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Many of these products and services are dominant in their respective industries, as is Google Search. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail. Google's other ventures outside of internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google DeepMind).\nGoogle Search and YouTube are the two most-visited websites worldwide, followed by Facebook and Twitter (now known as X). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, online video platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, machine learning framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes as of January 2022 and fourth by Interbrand as of February 2022. The company has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust, and abuse of its monopoly position.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nGoogle began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California, USA. The project initially involved an unofficial \"third founder\", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company; Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.\n\nWhile conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites. They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site. Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas. Page and Brin would also use their friend Susan Wojcicki's garage as their office when the search engine was set up in 1998.\nPage and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine \"BackRub\" because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. Hassan, as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeffrey Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project. PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.\nEventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word googol, a very large number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.\nGoogle was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds. Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a $250,000 investment.\nGoogle received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram. Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google's founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google's initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos' status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.\nBetween these initial investors, friends and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.\nCraig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.\nAfter some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999, a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999, with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital. Both firms were initially hesitant about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and Sergey however insisted on taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google's great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California, which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups. The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine. To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based. In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.\n\nIn 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California. The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million. By that time, the name \"Google\" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb \"google\" to be added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet\". The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\nAdditionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google. Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed.\n\n\n=== Initial public offering ===\nOn August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Page, Brin and Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024. The company opened on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker symbol GOOGL with an offering of 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share. Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal. The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.\n\nOn October 9, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock, On July 20, 2007, Google bids $4.6 billion for the wireless-spectrum auction by the FCC. On March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies. By 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-changing workload more efficiently.\nIn May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time. In May 2012, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in its largest acquisition to date. This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies, mainly Apple and Microsoft, and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.\n\n\n=== 2012 onwards ===\nIn June 2013, Google acquired Waze for $966 million. While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google's own mapping service. Google announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the \"health and well-being\" company would focus on \"the challenge of ageing and associated diseases\".\n\nOn January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies, a privately held AI company from London. Technology news website Recode reported that the company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price. The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the AI and robotics community. In 2015, DeepMind's AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a top human pro at the game of Go.\nAccording to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Alphabet's largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.\n\nOn August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company that argued bias and \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber\" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions. Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by \"advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace\", and he was fired on the same day.\nBetween 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company's leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and Project Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company. On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the exposé, \"How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the 'Father of Android'\". The company subsequently announced that \"48 employees have been fired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct. On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints. CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests. Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal activists.\nOn March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia.\nOn June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for antitrust violations. This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the company had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.\nIn December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google's new commerce chief. Ready's role will not be directly involved with Google Pay.\nIn April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel. Most employees were also working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home \nThe 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive among others, another in November affecting YouTube, and a third in December affecting the entire suite of Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.\nIn 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.\nIn January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to close off access to its search engine in Australia.\nIn March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia. Google spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of their biggest games to Stadia.\nIn April 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google ran a years-long program called \"Project Bernanke\" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services. This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in December.\nIn September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google's capability to sell targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers.\nIn 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all search queries. It would not remove content that is \"broadly useful\", such as news articles, or already part of the public record.\nIn May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display technology development and manufacturing Start-up company Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google's Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration.\nIn December 2022, Google debuted OSV-Scanner, a Go tool for finding security holes in open source software, which pulls from the largest open source vulnerability database of its kind to defend against supply chain attacks.\nFollowing the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google's senior management issued a \"code red\" and a \"directive that all of its most important products—those with more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months\". In March 2023, in direct response to the rapid rise of ChatGPT, Google released Bard (now Gemini), a generative artificial intelligence chatbot.\nIn early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company's tools, including AI technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing Google's total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.\nIn August 2024, Google would lose a lawsuit which started in 2020 in lower court, as it was found that the company had an illegal monopoly over Internet search. D.C. Circuit Court Judge Amit Mehta held that this monopoly was in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. In September 2024, the EU Court of Justice, based in Europe, would also find that Google held an illegal monopoly, in this case with regards to its shopping search, and could not avoid paying a €2.4 billion fine. The EU Court of Justice found that Google's treatment of rival shopping searches, which the court referred to as \"discriminatory\", was in violation of the Digital Markets Act.\nIn October 2024, Google was fined by a local Russian court a symbolic 2.5 decillion dollars for allegedly blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda. No payment was made.\nIn November 2024, Google announced the establishment of a new AI hub in Saudi Arabia, aiming to support the Kingdom's economic growth and technological development as part of its Vision 2030 initiative. This AI hub is projected to contribute up to $71 billion to Saudi Arabia's economy by advancing AI-driven solutions tailored to the region's specific needs and training local talent.\nThe partnership between Google and Saudi Arabia includes collaboration with key stakeholders, such as the Public Investment Fund (PIF), to develop AI applications that will benefit sectors like healthcare, finance, oil and gas, and logistics. The initiative focuses on creating localized AI technologies, with an emphasis on integrating Arabic language capabilities and enabling widespread cloud adoption.\nIn March 2025, Google agreed to acquire Wiz, a New York-based cybersecurity startup focusing on cloud computing, for US$32 billion. This cash deal would be Google's biggest ever, as well as it currently being the most expensive deal of 2025. Alphabet reportedly tried to close a deal for only $23 billion in 2024, but this fell apart after concerns about regulatory hurdles, among other issues. Wiz, a company located in the U.S. and Israel, was cofounded in 2020 by Assaf Rappaport. The company is backed by a number of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, as well as notably being partnered with Amazon and Microsoft, as listed in their website. Google reportedly said \"the deal would help artificial-intelligence companies get better security and use more than one cloud service.\"\nIn July 2025, the United States Department of Defense announced that Google had received a $200 million contract for AI in the military, along with Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI.\nIn September 2025, federal judge Amit Mehta in the United States ruled that Google will not be required to divest Chrome or the Android operating system. However, the ruling barred Google from having exclusive contracts for Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant and Gemini app products, and ruled Google must share search data with competitors. \n\n\n== Products and services ==\n\n\n=== Search engine ===\n\nGoogle indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators. According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%. In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.\nGoogle launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites. Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.\nGoogle expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002), finance (launched 2006), and flights (launched 2011).\n\n\n=== Advertising ===\n\nGoogle generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange. In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from its acquisition of DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history. In 2007, Google launched \"AdSense for Mobile\", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.\nGoogle Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page. Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme. The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked. One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid. Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility.\n\n\n=== Generative artificial intelligence ===\nGoogle had previously used virtual assistants and chatbots, such as Google Bard, prior to the announcement of Gemini in March 2024. None of them, however, had been seen as legitimate competitors to ChatGPT, unlike Gemini. An AI training program for Google employees was also introduced in April 2024.\nGoogle has created the text-to-image model Imagen, and the text-to-video model Veo. In 2025, Google announced SynthID Detector, a tool that uses watermarking to identify whether content such as text, images, audio, or video was generated using Google products.\nIn 2023, Google released NotebookLM, an online tool for synthesizing documents using Gemini. In September 2024, it gained attention for its \"Audio Overview\" feature, which generates podcast-like summaries of documents. Google also developed LearnLM, a family of language models serving as personal AI tutors.\n\n\n=== Consumer services ===\n\n\n==== Web-based services ====\n\nGoogle offers Gmail for email, Google Calendar for time-management and scheduling, Google Maps and Google Earth for mapping, navigation and satellite imagery, Google Drive for cloud storage of files, Google Docs, Sheets and Slides for productivity, Google Photos for photo storage and sharing, Google Keep for note-taking, Google Translate for language translation, YouTube for video viewing and sharing, Google My Business for managing public business information, Google Classroom for managing assignments and communication in education, and Duo for social interaction. A job search product has also existed since before 2017, Google for Jobs is an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from job boards and career sites. Google Earth, launched in 2005, allows users to see high-definition satellite pictures from all over the world for free through a client software downloaded to their computers.\n\n\n==== Software ====\nGoogle develops the Android mobile operating system, as well as its smartwatch, television, car, and Internet of things-enabled smart devices variations. It also develops the Google Chrome web browser, and ChromeOS, an operating system based on Chrome.\n\n\n==== Hardware ====\n\nIn January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone under its own brand. It spawned a number of phones and tablets under the \"Nexus\" branding until its eventual discontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.\nIn 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, which runs on ChromeOS.\nIn July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows users to stream content from their smartphones to televisions.\nIn June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.\nIn October 2016, Google announced Daydream View, a lightweight VR viewer which lets the user place their smartphone in the front hinge to view VR media.\nOther hardware products include:\n\nNest, a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music, find information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home appliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example). The Google Nest line includes the original Google Home (later succeeded by the Nest Audio), the Google Home Mini (later succeeded by the Nest Mini), the Google Home Max, the Google Home Hub (later rebranded as the Nest Hub), and the Nest Hub Max.\nNest Wifi (originally Google Wifi), a connected set of Wi-Fi routers to simplify and extend coverage of home Wi-Fi.\n\n\n=== Enterprise services ===\n\nGoogle Workspace (formerly G Suite until October 2020) is a monthly subscription offering for organizations and businesses to get access to a collection of Google's services, including Gmail, Google Drive and Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides, with additional administrative tools, unique domain names, and 24/7 support.\nOn September 24, 2012, Google launched Google for Entrepreneurs, a largely not-for-profit business incubator providing startups with co-working spaces known as Campuses, with assistance to startup founders that may include workshops, conferences, and mentorships. Presently, there are seven Campus locations: Berlin, London, Madrid, Seoul, São Paulo, Tel Aviv, and Warsaw.\nOn March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, \"a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers\" which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform. Among other things, the suite is designed to help \"enterprise class marketers\" \"see the complete customer journey\", generate \"useful insights\", and \"deliver engaging experiences to the right people\". Jack Marshall of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM.\n\n\n=== Internet services ===\nIn February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities. Following Google's corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company, Google Fiber was moved to Alphabet's Access division.\nIn April 2015, Google announced Project Fi, a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity and fast Internet signal.\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nIn August 2023, Google became the first major tech company to join the OpenWallet Foundation, launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital wallets.\n\n\n== Corporate affairs ==\n\n\n=== Business trends ===\nFrom the financial year of 2015, figures are published for Alphabet Inc. Until 2014, the key trends of Google were (as at the financial year ending December 31):\n\nGoogle's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share. The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion. The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007, primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market. The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds. GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares. The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.\nIn the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.\nFor the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues. In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.\nGoogle generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\"\nGoogle's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements. By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.\n\n\n=== Tax avoidance strategies ===\n\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent. This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's transfer pricing practices in 2012.\nIn 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the U.S.\nGoogle Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK. In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future. In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.\nIn 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.\n\n\n=== Corporate identity ===\n\nThe name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \"googol\", which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank: \"We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\" Google's mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\", and its unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\". In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\". The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.\nThe original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin. Since 1998, Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998. The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".\nGoogle has a tradition of creating April Fools' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web. In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.\nGoogle's services contain easter eggs, such as the Swedish Chef's \"Bork bork bork\", Pig Latin, \"Hacker\" or leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine. When searching for the word \"anagram\", meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays \"Did you mean: nag a ram?\" Since 2019, Google runs free online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better.\n\n\n=== Workplace culture ===\n\nOn Fortune magazine's list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012, and fourth in 2009 and 2010. Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index. Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as \"you can make money without doing evil\", \"you can be serious without a suit\", and \"work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun\".\nAs of September 30, 2020, Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees, of which more than 100,000 worked for Google. Google's 2020 diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%). Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held by women. In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary workers and contractors, as of March 2019.\nGoogle's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range \"from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six\". As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense, originated from these independent endeavors. In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google's vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.\nIn 2005, articles in The New York Times and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy. In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on. Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees. In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged \"no cold call\" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees. In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their \"conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race\".\nOn January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha Global, was announced. The coalition is made up of \"13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, [the] United Kingdom, and Switzerland\". The group is affiliated with the UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture. Google had previously been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union. In 2021, court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020, Google ran an anti-union campaign called Project Vivian to \"convince them (employees) that unions suck\".\nIn February 2025, Google dropped their commitment to make \"diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do\" from their annual investor report. This action followed Meta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walmart and others who all have rolled back their DEI programmes.\n\n\n=== Office locations ===\n\nGoogle's headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as \"the Googleplex\", a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a complex of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.\nIn 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet (27,900 m2) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The office houses its largest advertising sales team. In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion. In March 2018, Google's parent company Alphabet bought the nearby Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York. In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees. The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood. Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.\nBy late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon's campus in Pittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs. Other office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta; Austin; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; San Francisco; Seattle and Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nIt also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps) and London (part of Android development). In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January, Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017. In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.\nGoogle's Global Offices sum a total of 86 locations worldwide, with 32 offices in North America, three of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most Google's offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex. In the Latin America Region Google counts with 6 offices, in Europe 24 (3 of them in UK). The Asia Pacific region counts with 26 offices principally five in India and three in Australia, three in China, and the Africa Middle East region counts five offices.\n\n\n==== North America ====\n\n\n==== Latin America ====\n\n\n==== Europe ====\n\n\n==== Asia–Pacific ====\n\n\n==== Africa and the Middle East ====\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nGoogle has data centers in North and South America, Asia, and Europe. There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers. Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low. In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.\nGoogle has built its own private submarine communications cables. The first cable, named Curie, connects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019. The second fully Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to begin operation in 2020. Google's third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon (Portugal) with Lagos (Nigeria) and Cape Town (South Africa). The company's fourth cable, named Grace Hopper, connects landing points in New York (US), Bude (UK) and Bilbao (Spain), and is expected to become operational in 2022.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nIn October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 Megawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs. The system is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world. Since 2007, Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.\nIn Spring 2009, Google hired a herd of 200 goats for a week from California Grazing to mow their lawn. It was apparently more eco-friendly.\nGoogle disclosed in September 2011 that it \"continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes\", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.\nIn 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates. The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.\nIn July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.\nIn December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make Google \"the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\".\nIn November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma. In September 2019, Google's chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.\nIn September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the company's foundation in 1998. It also stated that it is committed to operating its data centers and offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030. In October 2020, the company pledged to make the packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by 2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of ending up in a landfill.\nIn 2023 Google consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the Dominican Republic, or Tunisia.\n\n\n==== Climate change denial and misinformation ====\nGoogle donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The company also actively funds and profits from climate disinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites. Google continued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company updated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\n\nIn 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion. The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program's executive director in 2004 and Megan Smith has since replaced him as director.\nIn March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted the first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View. In 2011, Google donated €1 million to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015). In July 2012, Google launched a \"Legalize Love\" campaign in support of gay rights.\nIn 2008, Google announced its \"project 10100\", which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites. After two years of no update, during which many wondered what had happened to the program, Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.\nResponding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a $15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens. The company also decided to transform its office in Warsaw into a help center for refugees.\nAlso in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit America.\n\n\n== Criticism and controversies ==\n\nGoogle has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance, search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content, and privacy.\nOther criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of other people's intellectual property, concerns that its compilation of data may violate people's privacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly, restraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent infringement.\n\n\n=== Political controversy ===\n\n\n==== United States ====\nIn a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project—Project Vivian—to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming unions.\n\n\n==== Brazil ====\nOn May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630, which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country's government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of R$1 million (2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad.\n\n\n==== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ====\nGoogle is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and Amazon provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud computing services, including building local cloud sites that will \"keep information within Israel's borders under strict security guidelines.\" The contract has been criticized by shareholders and employees over concerns that the project could lead to human rights abuses against Palestinians, in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the disputed status of Palestinian territories. Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google's educational products and an outspoken critic of the project, wrote that Google \"systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices concerned about Google's complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear\", and said she was retaliated against for organizing against the project.\nIn March 2024, The New York Times reported that Google Photos was being used in a facial recognition program by Unit 8200, a surveillance unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, to surveil Palestinians in the Gaza Strip amid the Gaza war. A Google spokesman commented that the service \"does not provide identities for unknown people in photographs\".\nOn April 18, 2024, Google dismissed 28 employees who participated in protests against the company's involvement in Project Nimbus, which the employees argued should not be used for military or intelligence services. The protesting employees, part of the group No Tech For Apartheid, staged sit-ins at Google's offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California, leading to disruptions and blockages within the company facilities. This had followed reports of Israeli forces killing large numbers of Palestinian civilians while using own Lavender AI system to identify targets.\nIn July 2025, Sergey Brin said in response to a UN report that used the term \"the genocide in Gaza\" and that claimed Google profited from it: \"throwing around the term genocide in relation to Gaza is deeply offensive to many Jewish people who have suffered actual genocides. I would also be careful citing transparently antisemitic organizations like the UN in relation to these issues\".\n\n\n==== Russia ====\nOn October 31, 2024, the Russian government imposed a \"symbolic\" fine of $20 decillion on Google for blocking pro-Russian YouTube channels. In 2022, during the invasion of Ukraine, a Russian court had ordered Google to restore the channels, with penalties doubling every week according to TASS. This comes alongside other large fines against social media companies accused of hosting content critical of the Kremlin or supportive of Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Antitrust ===\n\nIn July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox. In April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.\nIn 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle. The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company.\nGoogle reportedly paid Apple $22 billion in 2022 to maintain its position as the default search engine on Safari. It marks one of the largest payments between two tech giants in recent years.\n\n\n==== European Union ====\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of €2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.\"\nOn July 18, 2018, the European Commission fined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominants position has been referred to as Google's constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.\nOn March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to \"compete and innovate fairly\" in the online advertising market. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by \"imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites\" that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals.\nOn September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal of a €4.125 billion (£3.5 billion) fine, which was ruled to be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to carry Google's search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google has changed its policy.\nIn March 2024, a former Google software engineer and Chinese national, Linwei Ding, was accused of stealing confidential artificial intelligence information from the company and handing it to Chinese corporations. Ding had allegedly stolen over 500 files from the company over the course of 5 years, having been hired in 2019. Upon discovering Ding had been in contact with Chinese state-owned companies, Google notified the FBI, who carried on the investigation of the data breach.\nOn September 10, 2024, Europe's top court imposed a €2.4 billion fine on Google for abusing its dominance in the shopping comparison market, marking the conclusion of a case that began in 2009 with a complaint from British firm Foundem.\nOn September 18, 2024, Alphabet's Google won a €1.49 billion ($1.7 billion) antitrust fine from the European Union, while Qualcomm's efforts to repeal a penalty were unsuccessful. The General Court agreed with many of the European Commission's findings but annulled the Google fine, stating that the Commission failed to consider all relevant factors and did not demonstrate harm to innovation or consumers. Google noted that it had already changed its contract practices in 2016. Meanwhile, Qualcomm saw its fine reduced slightly but failed to overturn the ruling regarding its predatory pricing against Icera. Both companies have options to appeal further.\n\n\n==== United States ====\nAfter U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020, and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising. The lawsuit alleged that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones. Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to \"cooperate and assist one another\" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices. Another suit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology market. In August 2024, District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google held a monopoly in online search and text advertising in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\nOn October 8, 2024, The U.S. government suggested it could request Google to divest parts of its business, such as the Chrome browser and Android, due to its alleged monopoly in online search. The Justice Department aimed to limit Google's growing dominance in areas like AI. Google, which intended to appeal, argued that the proposals were too extreme, while also dealing with other antitrust cases involving its app store and advertising operations.\nIn November 2024, the Justice Department proposed major changes to curb Google's online search monopoly, including forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser, share search data with competitors, and end exclusive agreements that make Google the default search engine on devices like iPhones. The DoJ also sought a ban on Google re-entering the browser market for five years and restrictions on its investments in rival search or AI technologies. Google called these proposals excessive and harmful to consumers, pledging to appeal. A trial on the case was scheduled for April 2025, though the incoming administration and new DoJ leadership could potentially alter the course of the proceedings.\nIn September 2024, Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found that Google engaged in anti-competitive practices in the online advertising technology market, potentially harming thousands of UK publishers and advertisers. The investigation claimed Google used its market power to prevent rivals from competing fairly, affecting billions spent on digital ads. Google rejected the findings as flawed, stating its ad tech benefits businesses. If found guilty, Google could face penalties of up to 10% of its global turnover. Similar investigations are ongoing in the U.S. and EU, where regulators have suggested that Google may need to sell part of its ad-tech business.\nIt was ruled in 2025 by US Department of Justice alongside 17 other states that Google operates a monopoly in online advertising technology. The case will now move to a remedies stage which may lead to Alphabet, the owner of Google, being broken up.\n\n\n=== Gender discrimination lawsuit ===\nIn 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California's Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation practices.\n\n\n=== Censorship ===\n\nAccording to Ryan Gallagher of The Intercept in August 2018, Google was developing for the People's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) \"that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest\". Google was grilled at a Senate committee hearing on the project one month later. The project was canceled in December following the backlash it garnered both externally and internally within the company.\n\n\n=== Data loss ===\nIn May 2024, a misconfiguration in Google Cloud led to the accidental deletion of UniSuper's $135 billion Australian pension fund account, affecting over half a million members who were unable to access their accounts for a week. The outage, attributed to a cloud service error and not a cyberattack, prompted a joint apology from UniSuper and Google Cloud executives, who assured members that no personal data was compromised and restoration efforts were underway.\n\n\n=== Data privacy ===\nOn October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.\nOn January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was \"deeply committed\" to transparency and was \"studying the decision\" before determining its response.\nIn November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the \"mass collection of individuals' medical records\" complied with HIPAA. According to The Wall Street Journal, Google secretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.\nIn early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that Chrome's Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history. The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google's request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group's charges. Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google's CEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue. \nIn April 2024, it was announced that Google agreed to settle this lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement Google agreed to destroy billions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who thought they were browsing privately.\nOn January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet's Google 150 million euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of cookies along with Facebook.\nIn August 2024, Google sent an email to users informing them of its legal obligation to disclose certain confidential information to U.S. government authorities. The company stated that when it receives valid requests from government agencies to produce documents without redacting confidential customer information, it may produce such documents even if they are confidential to users. However, it will request confidential treatment of such information from the government.\nIn January 2025, U.S. federal judge Richard Seeborg rejected Google's motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit claims Google collected data from users who had specifically opted out of tracking. The trial is scheduled for August 2025.\n\n\n==== Geolocation ====\nGoogle has been criticized for continuing to collect location data from users who had turned off location-sharing settings. In 2020, the FBI used a geofence warrant to request data from Google about Android devices near the Seattle Police Officers Guild building following an arson attempt during Black Lives Matter protests. Google provided anonymized location data from devices in the area, which raised privacy concerns due to the potential inclusion of unrelated protesters.\n\n\n==== Copyright infringement ====\nOn March 20, 2024, Google was fined approximately $270 million by French regulators for using content from news outlets in France without proper disclosure to train its AI, Bard, now renamed Gemini, violating a previous commitment to negotiate content use transparently and fairly.\n\n\n==== U.S. government contracts ====\nFollowing media reports about PRISM, the NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google. According to unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.\nGoogle has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017 Project Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes. In April 2018, thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to end this controversial contract with the Pentagon. Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD contract, which was set to expire in 2019.\nIn 2022 Google shared a $9 billion contract from the Pentagon for cloud computing with Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMarcum, Deanna, and Roger C.

        "title": "Donald Trump",
        "content": "Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who is the 47th president of the United States. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.\nBorn into a wealthy family in New York City, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became the president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it the Trump Organization, and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He launched side ventures, many licensing the Trump name, and filed for six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show The Apprentice, bolstering his fame as a billionaire. Presenting himself as a political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton.\nDuring his first presidency, Trump imposed a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, expanded the Mexico–United States border wall, and enforced a family separation policy on the border. He rolled back environmental and business regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and appointed three Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear program, and initiated a trade war with China. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020, he downplayed its severity, contradicted health officials, and signed the CARES Act. After losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, Trump attempted to overturn the result, culminating in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him both times.\nIn 2023, Trump was found liable in civil cases for sexual abuse and defamation and for business fraud. He was found guilty of falsifying business records in 2024, making him the first U.S. president convicted of a felony. After winning the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris, he was sentenced to a penalty-free discharge, and two felony indictments against him for retention of classified documents and obstruction of the 2020 election were dismissed without prejudice. A racketeering case related to the 2020 election in Georgia is pending.\nTrump began his second presidency by initiating mass layoffs of federal workers. He imposed tariffs on nearly all countries at the highest level since the Great Depression and signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. His administration's actions—including intimidation of political opponents and civil society, deportations of immigrants, and extensive use of executive orders—have drawn over 300 lawsuits challenging their legality. High-profile cases have underscored his broad interpretation of the unitary executive theory and have led to significant conflicts with the federal courts. Judges found many of his administration's actions to be illegal, and several have been described as unconstitutional. \nSince 2015, Trump's leadership style and political agenda—often referred to as Trumpism—have reshaped the Republican Party's identity. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racist or misogynistic,  and he has made false or misleading statements and promoted conspiracy theories to an extent unprecedented in American politics. Trump's actions, especially in his second term, have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the New York City borough of Queens, the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. He is of German and Scottish descent. He grew up with his older siblings, Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, Robert, in a 23-room mansion in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. Fred Trump paid his children each about $20,000 a year, equivalent to $265,000 a year in 2024. Trump was a millionaire in inflation-adjusted dollars by age eight.\nTrump attended the private Kew-Forest School through seventh grade. He was a difficult child and showed an early interest in his father's business. His father enrolled him in New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, to complete secondary school. The academy pushed students into sports and taught the imperative of winning. In high school his grades improved to a B average. \nTrump considered a show business career but instead, to be closer to home, enrolled at Fordham University in 1964. He participated in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program during his first year, attending classes in a military uniform every Wednesday, but dropped it in his second year. He dropped football after three or four weeks and was a mediocre squash and tennis player. His Fordham friends introduced him to golf. His junior year he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, most often commuting to his father's office on weekends, and graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics. In college he was not the top student he sometimes claimed to be. By the time he went to Wharton—where he does not appear in a list of those receiving honors—he was eyeing a career in real estate. He was exempted from the draft during the Vietnam War due to a claim of bone spurs in his heels. Notwithstanding five years in military school, he had no interest in going to war.\nGrowing up, he considered his father and the family's pastor, Norman Vincent Peale, to be his mentors. His father told him repeatedly that he was \"a king\" and to be \"a killer\". Peale preached self-confidence as the impetus for prosperity.\n\n\n== Business career ==\n\n\n=== Real estate ===\nStarting in 1968, Trump was employed at Trump Management, his father's real estate company, which managed the middle-class apartment complexes Fred had built in Queens, Staten Island, and Brooklyn. His main tasks were collecting rent and making repairs for about five years. Captivated by its glamor and riches, Trump asked his father to expand to Manhattan where prices were at least three orders of magnitude higher, but his father was content in the outer boroughs. In 1971, he moved to Manhattan where he planned to move the business and commuted to his father's office. That year, his father made himself chairman and Trump president, overseeing 48 private corporations and 15 family partnerships. Trump began using Trump Organization as an  umbrella for the corporate names of his father's businesses.\nRoy Cohn, Trump's most important early influence after his father, was his fixer, lawyer, and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s. Cohn taught Trump to think that life is transactional. In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100 million (equivalent to $708 million in 2024) over its charges that Trump's properties had discriminated against Black applicants and tenants. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate. Four years later, the Trumps again faced the courts when they were found in contempt of the decree. Helping Trump projects, Cohn was a consigliere whose Mafia connections controlled construction unions. In 1979, Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.\nTrump moved from his studio to a penthouse with a view and got a real estate broker's license in the mid-1970s. Before age thirty, he showed his propensity for litigation, no matter the outcome and cost; even when he lost, he described the case as a win. Over three decades as of 2018, Trump had been involved in more than 4,000 lawsuits, liens, and other filings, often filed for nonpayment against him by employees, contractors, real estate brokers, and his own attorneys. Between 1991 and 2009, Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.\nIn 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp, each with a 20 percent share. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20–50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups. The increased costs were used to get state approval for increasing the rents of his rent-stabilized units. In January 1994, the siblings formed Apartment Management Associates and took over the management fees formerly collected by Trump Management. As well as inflating rents, the schemes served to transfer assets from Fred Trump to his children and nephew and lower the tax burden.\n\n\n==== Manhattan and Chicago developments ====\n\nTrump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture: the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan. The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel, and that same year, he obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was his primary residence until 2019. In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of 16 banks. The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.\nIn 1995, Trump defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a \"vast and humiliating restructuring\" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy. The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they \"all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead\". In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building. In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, Riverside South. Trump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, which opened in 2008. In 2024, The New York Times and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return.\n\n\n==== Atlantic City casinos ====\n\nIn 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation. It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control. In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle. Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992. Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990. He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance. To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses. In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza. THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10 percent ownership. He remained chairman until 2009.\n\n\n==== Golf clubs ====\nIn 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence. He declared the club his primary residence in 2019. He began building and buying golf courses in 1999, owning 17 golf courses by 2016.\n\n\n=== Licensing the Trump name ===\n\nThe Trump Organization often licensed the Trump name for consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, learning courses, and home furnishings. Over 50 licensing or management deals involved Trump's name, generating at least $59 million for his companies. By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name. During the 2000s, Trump licensed his name to residential property developments worldwide, 40 of which were never built.\n\n\n=== Side ventures ===\n\nIn 1970, Trump invested $70,000 of his father's wealth to receive billing as coproducer of a Broadway comedy—and lost the money. After making low-ball bids for the New York Mets and the Cleveland Indians baseball teams, in 1983 for about $6 million, he purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. The league folded after the 1985 season, largely due to his attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with the National Football League for audience) and his attempt to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit. Trump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall. In 1989 and 1990, he lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.\nFrom 1986 to 1988, he purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit, leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail. The New York Times found that he initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\".\n\nIn 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $1.01 billion in 2024) in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992. He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks. In 1996, he purchased the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002. In 2007, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe. NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015 in reaction to his comments about Mexican immigrants.\nIn 2005, Trump cofounded Trump University, a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010. In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. Additionally, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students. Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, he agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988. From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4 million, which had been spent by the end of 2006. After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity, which received millions from other donors, including $5 million from Vince McMahon. The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups, and charities that held events at Trump properties. In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including self-dealing and tax evasion. Also in 2016, the New York attorney general stated the foundation had violated state law by soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately. Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved. In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties. In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities. In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.\n\n\n=== Legal affairs and bankruptcies ===\n\nAccording to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions. While he has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009. They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties. During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion. After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him. After the January 6 Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with him or his affiliated company in the future.\n\n\n=== Wealth ===\n\nTrump has said he began his career with \"a small loan of a million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest. He borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely did not repay the loans, and received another $413 million (2018 equivalent, adjusted for inflation) from his father's company. Posing as a Trump Organization official named \"John Barron\", Trump called journalist Jonathan Greenberg in 1984, trying to get a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans. Trump self-reported his net worth over a wide range: from minus $900 million in 1990 to $10 billion in 2015. In 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth at $4.5 billion, based on interviews with more than 80 sources. In 2025, the magazine estimated his net worth at $5.1 billion and ranked him the 700th wealthiest person in the world.\n\n\n== Media career ==\n\nTrump has published 19 books under his name, most written or cowritten by ghostwriters. His first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller, and was credited by The New Yorker with making Trump famous as an \"emblem of the successful tycoon\". The book was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz, who is credited as a coauthor. Trump had cameos in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001. Trump acquired his style of politics from professional wrestling—with its staged fights and name-calling. He sporadically appeared for the professional wrestling company WWE from the late 1980s including Wrestlemania 23 in 2007. Starting in the 1990s, Trump appeared 24 times as a guest on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show. He had his own short-form talk radio program, Trumped!, from 2004 to 2008. From 2011 until 2015, he was a guest commentator on Fox & Friends. In 2021, Trump, who had been a member since 1989, resigned from SAG-AFTRA to avoid a disciplinary hearing regarding the January 6 attack. Two days later, the union permanently barred him.\n\n\n=== The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice ===\n\nProducer Mark Burnett made Trump a television star when he created The Apprentice, which Trump hosted from 2004 to 2015 (including variant The Celebrity Apprentice). On the shows, he was a superrich chief executive who eliminated contestants with the catchphrase \"you're fired\". The New York Times called his portrayal \"a highly flattering, highly fictionalized version\" of himself. The shows remade Trump's image for millions of viewers nationwide. With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million.\n\n\n== Early political aspirations ==\n\nTrump registered as a Republican in 1987; a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999; a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.\n\nIn 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in major newspapers expressing his views on foreign policy and how to eliminate the federal budget deficit. In 1988, he approached Lee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee George H. W. Bush's running mate. Bush found the request \"strange and unbelievable\". Trump was a candidate in the 2000 Reform Party presidential primaries for three months before he withdrew in February 2000. In 2011, Trump considered challenging President Barack Obama in the 2012 election. He spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February and gave speeches in states with early primaries. In May 2011, he announced that he would not run.\n\n\n== 2016 presidential election ==\n\nTrump announced his candidacy for the 2016 election in June 2015. He campaigned as a rich, successful businessman and an outsider without political experience, and claimed media bias against him. His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive, and a record number were false. He became the Republican front-runner in March 2016 and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.\n\nTrump described NATO as \"obsolete\" and espoused views described by The Washington Post as noninterventionist and protectionist. His campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and strongly enforcing immigration laws. Other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations, modernizing services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated increasing military spending and extreme vetting or banning of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries. He promised to build a wall on the Mexico–U.S. border and vowed that Mexico would pay for it. He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the U.S., and criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing \"anchor babies\". According to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made \"explicitly racist and sexist appeals to win over white voters\" during his 2016 presidential campaign. In particular, his campaign launch speech drew criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\"; in response, NBC fired him from Celebrity Apprentice.\nTrump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million. He did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office. He said his tax returns were being audited, and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them. After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the U.S. Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury. In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that he had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.\nTrump won 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. After elector defections on both sides, the official count was 304 to 227. The fifth person to be elected president despite losing the popular vote, he received nearly 2.9 million fewer votes than Clinton, 46.3% to her 48.25%. He was the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president. His election marked the return of a Republican undivided government. Trump's victory sparked protests in major U.S. cities.\n\n\n== First presidency (2017–2021) ==\n\n\n=== Early actions ===\n\nTrump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. The day after his inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including 500,000 in Washington, D.C., protested against him in the Women's Marches. During his first week in office, Trump signed six executive orders, including authorizing procedures for repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline projects, and planning for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\n\n=== Conflicts of interest ===\n\nBefore being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust, rather than a blind trust or equivalent arrangement \"to cleanly sever himself from his business interests\". He continued to profit from his businesses and knew how his administration's policies affected them. Although he said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization pursued operational expansions in Scotland, Dubai, and the Dominican Republic. Lobbyists, foreign government officials, and Trump donors and allies generated hundreds of millions of dollars for his resorts and hotels. Trump was sued for violating the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated. One case was dismissed in lower court. Two were dismissed by the Supreme Court as moot after his term.\nDuring the campaign, Trump had pledged to donate his presidential salary and profits from foreign patronage to the U.S. government. He donated his salary to federal agencies and publicized each donation until July 2020. Federal agencies surveyed by The Washington Post in July 2021 reported not having received any gifts after that month. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington reported in 2024 that he had donated $448,000 of an estimated $13.6 million in payments from foreign governments in his first term.\n\n\n=== Domestic policy ===\n\nTrump took office at the height of the longest economic expansion in American history, which began in 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began. In December 2017, he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals and eliminated the penalty associated with the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. The Trump administration claimed that the act would not decrease government revenue, but 2018 revenues were 7.6 percent lower than projected. Under Trump, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019. By the end of his term, the U.S. national debt increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75 trillion, and the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio hit a post-World War II high. Trump also failed to deliver on his campaign promise of a $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan.\nTrump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by three million people. He rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change. He withdrew from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation to not ratify it. He aimed to boost the production and exports of fossil fuels. Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline. He rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge.\nTrump dismantled federal regulations on health, labor, the environment, and other areas, including a bill that revoked the Obama-era regulation restricting the sale of firearms to severely mentally ill people. During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations, often \"after requests by the regulated industries\". The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of his proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation. During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders. He expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration halved the enrollment period and drastically reduced funding for enrollment promotion. In June 2018, the Trump administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the Act unconstitutional. Their pleading would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans, but was unsuccessful. During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs. In January 2020, he expressed willingness to consider cuts to them.\nIn response to the opioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. He barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds. He said he supported \"traditional marriage\", but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage \"settled\". His administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBTQ people. His attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections for transgender patients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after a Supreme Court ruling extended employees' civil rights protections to gender identity and sexual orientation. Trump has said he is opposed to gun control, although his views have shifted over time. His administration took an anti-marijuana position, revoking Obama-era policies that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana. He is a long-time advocate of capital punishment, and his administration oversaw the federal government execute 13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined, ending a 17-year moratorium. In 2016, he said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods \"a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\"\n\n\n=== Race relations ===\n\nTrump's comments on the 2017 Unite the Right rally, condemning \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\" and stating that there were \"very fine people on both sides\", were criticized as implying a moral equivalence between the white supremacist demonstrators and the counter-protesters. In a January 2018 discussion of immigration legislation, he reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\". His remarks were condemned as racist.\n\nIn July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen—all minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans—should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\". Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240–187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\". White nationalist publications and social media praised his remarks, which continued over the following days. He continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign. In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, federal law-enforcement officials used tear gas and other crowd control tactics to remove a largely peaceful crowd of lawful protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House. Trump then posed with a Bible for a photo-op at the nearby St. John's Episcopal Church, with religious leaders condemning both the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself. Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned his proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.\n\n\n=== Pardons and commutations ===\n\nDuring his first term, Trump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities. In his last full day in office, he granted 73 pardons and commuted 70 sentences. Several Trump allies were not eligible for pardons under Justice Department rules, and in other cases the department had opposed clemency. The pardons of three military service members convicted of or charged with violent crimes were opposed by military leaders.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\n\nAs president, Trump described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" of the United States and drastically escalated immigration enforcement. He implemented harsh policies against asylum seekers and deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.–Mexico border to stop illegal crossings. He reduced the number of refugees admitted to record lows, from an annual limit of 110,000 before he took office to 15,000 in 2021. Trump also increased restrictions on granting permanent residency to immigrants needing public benefits. One of his central campaign promises was to build a wall along the U.S.–Mexico border; during his first term, the U.S. built 73 miles (117 km) of wall in areas without barriers and 365 miles (587 km) to replace older barriers. In 2018, Trump's refusal to sign any spending bill unless it allocated funding for the border wall resulted in the longest-ever federal government shutdown, for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019. The shutdown ended after he agreed to fund the government without any funds for the wall. To avoid another shutdown, Congress passed a funding bill with $1.4 billion for border fencing in February. Trump later declared a national emergency on the southern border to divert $6.1 billion of funding to the border wall despite congressional disagreement.\nIn January 2017, Trump signed an executive order that denied entry to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries for four months and from Syria indefinitely. The order caused many protests and legal challenges that resulted in nationwide injunctions. A revised order giving some exceptions was also blocked by courts, but the Supreme Court ruled in June that the ban could be enforced on those lacking \"a bona fide relationship with a person or entity\" in the U.S. Trump replaced the ban in September with a presidential proclamation extending travel bans to North Koreans, Chadians, and some Venezuelan officials, but excluded Iraq and Sudan. The Supreme Court allowed that version to go into effect in December 2017, and ultimately upheld the ban in 2019. From 2017 to 2018, the Trump administration had a policy of family separation that separated over 4,400 children of illegal immigrants from their parents at the U.S.–Mexico border, an unprecedented policy sparked public outrage in the country. Despite Trump initially blaming Democrats and insisting he could not stop the policy with an executive order, he acceded to public pressure in June 2018 and mandated that illegal immigrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" of risk for the child. A judge later ordered that the families be reunited and further separations stopped except in limited circumstances, though over 1,000 additional children were separated from their families after the order.\n\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n\nTrump described himself as a \"nationalist\" and his foreign policy as \"America First\". He supported populist, neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments. Unpredictability, uncertainty, and inconsistency characterized foreign relations during his tenure. Relations between the U.S. and its European allies were strained under Trump. He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested that the U.S. should withdraw from NATO. Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In 2020, Trump hosted the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize their foreign relations.\n\nTrump began a trade war with China in 2018 after imposing tariffs and other trade barriers he said would force China to end longstanding unfair trade practice and intellectual property infringement. Trump weakened the toughest U.S. sanctions imposed after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Trump praised and, according to some critics, rarely criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin, though he opposed some actions of Russia's government. He withdrew the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian noncompliance, and supported Russia's possible return to the G7. As North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, meeting Kim Jong Un three times: in Singapore in June 2018, in Hanoi in February 2019, and in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in June 2019. Talks in October 2019 broke down and no denuclearization agreement was reached.\n\n\n=== Personnel ===\n\nBy the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned. As of early July 2018, 61 percent of his senior aides had left and 141 staffers had left in the previous year. Both figures set a record for recent presidents. Close personal aides to Trump quit or were forced out. He publicly disparaged several of his former top officials.\nTrump had four White House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several. In May 2017, he dismissed FBI director James Comey, saying a few days later that he was concerned about Comey's role in the Trump–Russia investigations. Three of Trump's 15 original cabinet members left or were forced to resign within his first year. Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee. By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled and he had no nominee for 264.\n\n\n=== Judiciary ===\n\nTrump appointed 226 federal judges, including 54 to the courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. His Supreme Court appointments politically shifted the Court to the right. In the 2016 campaign, he pledged that Roe v. Wade would be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and given the opportunity to appoint two or three anti-abortion justices. He later took credit when Roe was overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in 2022; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority. Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. His attacks on courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of his statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.\n\n\n=== COVID-19 pandemic ===\n\nTrump initially ignored public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration. Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29. On March 27, he signed into law the CARES Act—a $2.2 trillion bipartisan economic stimulus bill—the largest stimulus in U.S. history. After weeks of attacks to draw attention away from his slow response, Trump halted funding of the World Health Organization in April. In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic; Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter, although the targeted states did not meet his administration's guidelines for reopening. He repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored, such as approving unproven treatments. In October, Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for three days with a severe case of COVID-19.\n\n\n=== Investigations ===\n\nAfter he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation. There were ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.\nIn July 2016, the FBI launched Crossfire Hurricane, an investigation into possible links between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. After Trump fired Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a second investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia. In January 2017, three U.S. intelligence agencies jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor Trump. Many suspicious links between Trump associates and Russian officials were discovered. Trump told Russian officials he was unconcerned about Russia's election interference. Crossfire Hurricane was later transferred to Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation; the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia was ended by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after he told the FBI that Mueller would pursue the matter. At the request of Rosenstein, the Mueller investigation examined criminal matters \"in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference\". Mueller submitted his final report in March 2019. The report found that Russia did interfere in 2016 to favor Trump and that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged the effort, but that the evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russia. Trump claimed the report exonerated him despite Mueller writing that it did not. The report also detailed potential obstruction of justice by Trump but \"did not draw ultimate conclusions\" and left the decision to charge the laws to Congress.\nIn April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. He sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures. In May, two judges ruled that both Mazars and the banks must comply with the subpoenas; Trump's attorneys appealed. In September 2022, Trump and the committee agreed to a settlement regarding Mazars, and the firm began turning over documents.\n\n\n=== Impeachments ===\n\nTrump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, though acquitted by the Senate on both occasions. The first impeachment arose from a whistleblower complaint that in July 2019 Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, in an attempt to gain an advantage in the 2020 presidential election. In December 2019, the House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and the Senate acquitted him in February 2020.\nThe second impeachment came after the January 6 Capitol attack, for which the House charged Trump with incitement of insurrection on January 13, 2021. Trump left office on January 20, and was acquitted on February 13. Seven Republican senators voted for conviction.\n\n\n== 2020 presidential election ==\n\nTrump filed to run for reelection only a few hours after becoming president in 2017. He held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020. Trump's campaign focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Democratic nominee Joe Biden won. He repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions and appealed to racism. Starting in early 2020, Trump sowed doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that it would be rigged and that widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud. He blocked funding for the U.S. Postal Service, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail. He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results if he lost and commit to a peaceful transition of power.\n\n\n=== Loss to Biden and rejection of outcome ===\n\nBiden won the November 2020 election, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent) and 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232. The Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14. Trump declared victory before the results were known on the morning after the election. Days later, when Biden was projected the winner, Trump baselessly alleged election fraud. As part of an effort to overturn the results, Trump and his allies filed many lawsuits challenging the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both state and federal courts for having no factual or legal basis.\nTrump's allegations were also refuted by state election officials, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a case asking it to overturn the results in four states won by Biden. Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders, Republican legislators, the Justice Department, and Vice President Pence, urging actions such as replacing presidential electors, or that Georgia officials \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result. In the weeks after the election, Trump withdrew from public activities. He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition. After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team. While Trump said he recommended that the GSA begin transition protocols, he still did not formally concede. Trump did not attend Biden's inauguration on January 20.\n\n\n=== January 6 Capitol attack ===\n\nIn December 2020, reports emerged that U.S. military leaders were on high alert, and ranking officers had discussed what to do if Trump declared martial law. CIA director Gina Haspel and Army general Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, grew concerned that Trump might attempt a coup or military action against China or Iran. Milley insisted that he be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAt noon on January 6, 2021, while Congress was certifying the presidential election results in the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a rally at the nearby Ellipse. Speaking from behind a glass barrier, he called for the election to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol. His supporters then formed a mob that broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress. During the attack, Trump posted on social media but did not ask the rioters to disperse. In a tweet at 6 p.m., he told them to \"go home with love & in peace\", called them \"great patriots\", and restated that he had won the election. Congress later reconvened and confirmed Biden's victory in the early hours of January 7.\nMore than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died during or after the attack. The event has been described as an attempted self-coup by Trump.\n\n\n== Between presidencies (2021–2025) ==\nUpon leaving the White House, Trump began living at Mar-a-Lago, establishing an office there as provided for by the Former Presidents Act. His continuing false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the \"big lie\" by his critics, although in May 2021, he and many of his supporters began using the term to refer to the election itself. The Republican Party used his false claims about the election to justify imposing new voting restrictions in its favor. As of July 2022, he continued to pressure state legislators to overturn the election. Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; a 2022 profile in The New York Times described him as a modern party boss. He continued fundraising, raising a war chest containing more than twice that of the Republican Party, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on party governance and installing in key posts officials loyal to him. In the 2022 midterm elections, he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices. In February 2021, he registered a new company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), for providing \"social networking services\" to U.S. customers. In March 2024, TMTG merged with special-purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition and became a public company. In February 2022, TMTG launched Truth Social, a social media platform.\n\n\n=== Legal issues ===\n\nIn 2019, journalist E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her in the 1990s and sued him for defamation over his denial. Carroll sued him again in 2022 for battery and more defamation. He was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered to pay $5 million in one case and $83.3 million in the other. In 2022, New York filed a civil lawsuit against Trump accusing him of inflating the Trump Organization's value to gain an advantage with lenders and banks. He was found liable and ordered to pay nearly $355 million plus interest. In August 2025, the appeals court upheld Trump's liability and nonmonetary penalties but voided the monetary penalty as excessive.\n\nIn connection with Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his involvement in the January 6 attack, in December 2022 the U.S. House committee on the attack recommended criminal charges against him for obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and inciting or assisting an insurrection. In August 2023, a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, indicted him on 13 charges, including racketeering, for his efforts to subvert the 2020 election in the state.\nIn January 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of documents Trump had taken to Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House, some of which were classified. In the ensuing Justice Department investigation, officials retrieved more classified documents from his lawyers. On August 8, 2022, FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago for illegally held documents, including those in breach of the Espionage Act, collecting 11 sets of classified documents, some marked top secret. A federal grand jury constituted by Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump in June 2023 on 31 counts of \"willfully retaining national defense information\" under the Espionage Act, among other charges. Trump pleaded not guilty. In July 2024, judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case, ruling Smith's appointment as special prosecutor was unconstitutional.\nIn May 2024, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The case stemmed from evidence that he booked Michael Cohen's hush-money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels as business expenses to cover up his alleged 2006–2007 affair with Daniels during the 2016 election. On January 10, 2025, the judge gave Trump a no-penalty sentence known as an unconditional discharge, saying that punitive requirements would have interfered with presidential immunity. After his reelection, the 2020 election obstruction case and the classified documents case were dismissed without prejudice due to Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.\n\n\n== 2024 presidential election ==\n\nIn November 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election and created a fundraising account. In March 2023, the campaign began diverting ten percent of the donations to his leadership PAC. His campaign had paid $100 million towards his legal bills by March 2024.\nDuring the campaign, Trump made increasingly violent and authoritarian statements. He said that he would weaponize the FBI and the Justice Department against his political opponents and use the military to target Democratic politicians and those that did not support his candidacy. He used harsher and more dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric than during his presidency. His rhetoric, calling his political opponents \"the enemy\", vermin, and fascists, has been described by some historians and scholars as authoritarian, fascist, and unlike anything a political candidate has ever said in American history. Age and health concerns also arose during the campaign, with several medical experts highlighting an increase in rambling, tangential speech and behavioral disinhibition.\nTrump mentioned \"rigged election\" and \"election interference\" earlier and more frequently than in the 2016 and 2020 campaigns and refused to commit to accepting the 2024 election results. Analysts for The New York Times described this as an intensification of his \"heads I win; tails you cheated\" rhetorical strategy; the newspaper stated that the claim of a rigged election had become the backbone of the campaign.\nOn July 13, 2024, Trump was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler Township, Pennsylvania. Two days later, the 2024 Republican National Convention nominated him as their presidential candidate. In September, he was targeted but unharmed in an assassination attempt in Florida. Trump won the election in November 2024 with 312 electoral votes to incumbent vice president Kamala Harris's 226. He also won the popular vote with 49.8% to Harris' 48.3%. His victory in 2024 was part of a global backlash against incumbent parties, in large part due to the 2021–2023 inflation surge. Several outlets described his reelection as an extraordinary comeback.\n\n\n== Second presidency (2025–present) ==\n\nTrump began his second term upon his inauguration on January 20, 2025. He became the oldest individual to assume the presidency, the first president with a felony conviction, and the second person to serve two nonconsecutive terms as president.\n\n\n=== Early actions, 2025–present ===\n\nUpon taking office, Trump signed a series of executive orders. Many of these tested his legal authority, and drew immediate legal action. He issued more executive orders on his first day than any other president. Four days into his second term, analysis conducted by Time found that nearly two-thirds of his executive actions \"mirror or partially mirror\" proposals from Project 2025. In his first weeks, several of his actions ignored or violated federal laws, regulations, and the Constitution according to American legal scholars. In his administration's first month, Trump issued ninety executive orders, memorandums, and directives. He used the government to target his political opponents and his actions against civil society were described by legal experts and hundreds of political scientists as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding. His orders and actions were challenged by over 300 lawsuits nationwide, with most of them still moving through the courts by July 2.\n\n\n=== Conflicts of interest, 2025–present ===\n\nTrump's second presidency was described as having fewer guardrails against conflicts of interest than his first, and breaking with decades of ethical norms. He maintained a publicly traded company in Trump Media & Technology Group, and diversified it into financial services. He pursued new overseas real estate deals involving state-affiliated entities, and had several branding and licensing deals selling Trump-branded merchandise. He profited from events held at his hotels and golf courses and did not place his assets in a blind trust, as previous presidents had done. In August 2025, Trump's mandatory disclosure of investment showed that, since taking office, he had made 690 purchases of municipal bonds and corporate stock totaling around at least $104 million. Included was stock in companies affected by his changes to federal policies.\nTrump repealed the previous administration's ethics guidelines and enforcement of laws prohibiting bribery without establishing formal ethics guidelines for his political appointees, many of whom entered his administration with an \"uncharacteristically large list of potential conflicts of interest\". He dropped corruption charges against politicians with ties to him and paused enforcement of the law prohibiting companies operating in the U.S. to bribe foreign governments.\nTrump launched, promoted, and personally benefited from two cryptocurrency tokens (\"meme coins\"), $Trump and $Melania. He also directly benefited from his family's cryptocurrency company World Liberty Financial, which engaged in an unprecedented mixing of private enterprise and government policy.\nIn July 2025, the Trump administration accepted a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar to serve as Air Force One until the end of his second term and then be transferred to his presidential library. The retrofitting as Air Force One is estimated to cost up to $1 billion.\n\n\n=== Mass terminations of federal employees ===\n\nTrump implemented a hiring freeze across the federal government and ordered telework of federal employees to be discontinued within 30 days. He ordered a review of many career civil service positions with the intention of reclassifying them into at-will positions without job protections. He initiated mass job terminations of federal employees, which were described by legal experts as unprecedented or in violation of federal law, with the intent of replacing them with workers more aligned with his agenda. By late February, the administration had fired more than 30,000 people. To facilitate further terminations, it adopted a novel legal interpretation that vastly expands the range of departments and agencies considered as having national security for their primary function, declaring various federal workers' unions \"hostile\". A late March executive order based on this interpretation excluded dozens of departments and agencies from federal labor-management relations programs, prompting them to sue to invalidate their collective bargaining agreements, which could remove union protections from one million federal employees. He ordered an end to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) projects in the federal government and placed employees in DEI offices on leave. He rescinded Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 Executive Order 11246, which mandated that federal contractors take affirmative action to end racial discrimination.\nTrump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency largely dismantled several federal agencies including USAID and the Department of Education, unilaterally fired several thousand staff, and reduced administrative functions to statutory minimums. Some actions, such as attempts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, were paused by federal courts. Many of his actions attempted to bring historically independent institutions under direct executive branch control in diminished forms.\n\n\n=== Pardons and commutations, 2025–present ===\n\nAs in his first presidency, Trump frequently bypassed the Office of the Pardon Attorney. He installed political loyalist Ed Martin who described the rationale for granting pardons as \"No MAGA left behind\". Trump's pardons and grants of clemency favored political allies and loyalists, and disproportionately pardoned \"the powerful, famous, well-connected and wealthy\" accused of white-collar crime. Trump granted clemency to all January 6 rioters convicted or charged on his first day in office, including those who violently attacked police, by pardoning more than 1,500 and commuting the sentences of 14.\n\n\n=== Domestic policy, 2025–present ===\n\nTrump inherited a resilient economy from the Biden administration, with increasing economic growth, low unemployment, and declining inflation. He ordered agencies to stop enforcement of disfavored rules in an attempt at large-scale deregulation that legal experts described as illegal and contrary to decades of federal law. He sought greater government control over private businesses and abandoned traditional conservative free market orthodoxy, instead favoring state capitalism by taking direct government equity stakes in major U.S. corporations.\nTrump canceled and paused federal grants and made large cuts to scientific research, several of which were found by judges and the Government Accountability Office as being illegal and unconstitutional. He promoted climate change denial and misinformation, and appointed oil, gas, and chemical lobbyists to the EPA to reverse climate regulations and pollution controls. Trump relied on declaring national emergencies to justify hundreds of actions and bypass congressional approval or regulatory review. For instance, he declared a national energy emergency, allowing the suspension of environmental regulations, loosening the rules for fossil fuel extraction and limiting renewable energy projects. He initiated a review of the \"legality and continued applicability\" of the EPA endangerment finding, which is the basis of most federal regulations on greenhouse gases, and again withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change.\nDismantling government agencies enforcing the laws against political corruption and white-collar fraud, Trump reduced the Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section from 30 to five lawyers, dismissed 17 independent inspectors general at government agencies and 12 members of independent oversight boards and watchdog agencies, and disbanded the squad in the FBI's Washington field office that investigated allegations of fraud and corruption against government officials and members of Congress. He pardoned or dropped charges against officials accused of corruption.\nTrump attributed societal problems to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and wokeness. Equating diversity with incompetence, he reversed pro-diversity policies in the federal government. His administration aggressively moved against the rights of transgender people and what it termed \"gender ideology\". He sought to remake civil society to his preferences by executive order. On DEI and antisemitism grounds, he threatened cultural institutions and sixty universities, and forced law firms to capitulate to his political agenda.\nTrump attempts to shape the federal government generally by trying to fire officeholders and by assigning multiple jobs to loyalists. He tried to subjugate the Federal Reserve board of governors. He abrogated dissent at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and fired the top official at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and many others. He fired his own appointees including the head of the Internal Revenue Service. In contrast, by August 2025, among allies with multiple jobs, Trump had Marco Rubio and Russell Vought in three administration jobs apiece.\nHe sent federal troops to Washington, D.C., and sent threats to other cities.\n\n\n==== One Big Beautiful Bill Act ====\nIn July 2025, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law. The bill made the tax cuts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent and added additional tax deductions for a total of around $4.5 trillion, mostly benefiting the highest income brackets and costing people in the lowest income bracket $1,600 per year; increased funding for national defense, deportations, the border wall, and a missile shield; and removed tax credits for clean energy projects using renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power and for buyers of electric vehicles. The bill cut funding for Medicaid and SNAP and added additional work requirements for eligibility and a $35 co-payment for some Medicaid services; the cuts and additional requirements will take effect after the 2026 general election. The bill was projected by the Congressional Budget Office to increase the budget deficit by $3.4 trillion by 2034, cause 11.8 million people to lose Medicaid coverage, and eliminate SNAP benefits for three million people.\n\n\n=== Immigration, 2025–present ===\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump instructed Border Patrol agents to summarily deport illegal immigrants crossing the border, disabling the CBP One app that was being used to schedule border crossings. He resumed the remain in Mexico policy, designated drug cartels as terrorist groups, and ordered construction to be resumed on a border wall.\nDeportation operations first focused on \"target lists\" of criminals formed prior to Trump's second term. Then his administration removed asylum applicants who failed to meet requirements, revoked the parole status of immigrants who entered the U.S. under CBP One and CHNV humanitarian parole, attempted to remove birthright citizenship, and suspended the Refugee Admissions Program. In March, he used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to imprison illegal immigrants without trial—one by \"administrative error\" and most without criminal records—at the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador. He targeted activists, legal immigrants, tourists, and students with visas who expressed criticism of his policies or pro-Palestinian advocacy.\n\n\n=== Foreign policy, 2025–present ===\n\nTrump's second term foreign policy has been variously described as imperialist, expansionist, isolationist, and autarkist, employing the \"America First\" ideology as its cornerstone. His relations with allies were transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, including threats of annexation. He ordered the U.S. government to stop funding and working with the WHO and announced the U.S.'s intention to formally leave the WHO.\n\nIn February 2025, Trump and Vice President Vance met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, in the Oval Office. The meeting, which was televised live, was highly contentious as Trump and Vance berated Zelenskyy. Media outlets described it as an unprecedented public confrontation between an American president and a foreign head of state.\nTrump and his incoming administration helped broker a Gaza war ceasefire alongside the Biden administration, enacted a day prior to his inauguration. In March, Israel broke the ceasefire.\nTrump's economic policies have been described as protectionist, with Trump imposing tariffs on most countries, including large tariffs on major trading partners China, Canada, and Mexico. He started a global trade war, imposing tariffs at the highest level since the 1930 Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act at the onset of the Great Depression. Economists argued that the administration misunderstood the relationship between trade deficits and tariffs, using flawed assumptions. He suspended American financial contributions to the World Trade Organization.\n\n\n=== Personnel, 2025–present ===\n\nIn his second term, Trump selected cabinet members with personal loyalty to him, with the \"focus on loyalty over subject-matter expertise\". In February 2025, the White House stated that Elon Musk was a special government employee. Trump gave Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to many federal government agencies. Musk's teams operated in eighteen departments and agencies in the administration's first month, including in the Treasury Department's $5 trillion payment system, the Small Business Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration. He nominated or appointed 23 former Fox News employees to his administration.\n\n\n=== Judiciary, 2025–present ===\n\nFederal judges found many of the administration's actions to be illegal. Following legal setbacks, Trump increased his criticism of the judiciary and called for impeachment of federal judges who ruled against him. He threatened, signed executive actions, and ordered investigations into his political opponents, critics, and organizations aligned with the Democratic Party. By mid-July, a Washington Post analysis found he defied judges and the courts in roughly one third of all cases against him, actions which were described by legal experts as unprecedented for any presidential administration. His defiance of court orders and a claimed right to disobey the courts raised fears among legal experts of a constitutional crisis. \nMultiple analyses conducted by academic scholars and The New York Times found that both Republican and Democratic judicial appointees have found numerous constitutional and statutory flaws with Trump administration policies. His administration asserted a constitutional right to ignore federal law in its justification of several actions such as in his refusal to enforce a federal ban on TikTok, with legal experts describing it as claiming a \"constitutional power to immunize private parties to commit otherwise illegal acts with impunity\". He also engaged in an unprecedented targeting of law firms and lawyers that previously represented positions adverse to himself.\n\n\n== Political practice and rhetoric ==\n\nBeginning with his 2016 campaign, Trump's politics and rhetoric led to the creation of a political movement known as Trumpism. His political positions are populist, more specifically described as right-wing populist. He has been described as embracing far-right extremism, and he helped bring far-right fringe ideas and organizations into the mainstream. Many of his actions and rhetoric have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding. Trump pushed for an expansion of presidential power under a maximalist interpretation of the unitary executive theory. His political base has been compared to a cult of personality.\nTrump's rhetoric and actions have been accused of creating and exacerbating anger and distrust through the use of an \"us\" versus \"them\" narrative. He explicitly and routinely disparages racial, religious, and ethnic minorities, and scholars consistently find that racial animus regarding blacks, immigrants, and Muslims are the best predictors of support for Trump. His rhetoric has been described as using fearmongering and demagogy which intensified during his 2024 presidential campaign. He has said that he believes real power comes from fear. The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported his candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration. He has a strong appeal to evangelical Christian voters and Christian nationalists, and his rallies take on the symbols, rhetoric, and agenda of Christian nationalism. Trump has also used anti-communist sentiment in his rhetoric, regularly calling his opponents \"communists\" and \"Marxists\".\n\n\n=== Racial and gender views ===\n\nMany of Trump's comments and actions have been characterized as racist. In a 2018 national poll, about half of respondents said he is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists. Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled his political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters. Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are strong indicators of support for Trump. He has been accused of racism for insisting a group of five black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated in 2002.\nIn 2011, Trump became the leading proponent of the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States. He claimed credit for pressuring the government to publish Obama's birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent. He acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S. in September 2016, though reportedly expressed birther views privately in 2017. During the 2024 presidential campaign, he made false attacks against the racial identity of his opponent, Kamala Harris, that were described as reminiscent of the birther conspiracy theory. His 2024 campaign made extensive use of dehumanizing language and racial stereotypes. In 2025, he promoted false claims of white genocide in South Africa and created the White South African refugee program.\nTrump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media. He made lewd comments, disparaged women's physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets. As of 2020, 26 women have publicly accused him of sexual misconduct, including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. He has denied the allegations. In October 2016, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which he bragged about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that, \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy.\" He characterized the comments as \"locker-room talk\". The incident's widespread media exposure led to his first public apology, videotaped during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\n=== Link to violence and hate crimes ===\n\nTrump has been identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in the U.S., both for and against him. He is described as embracing extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon, and far-right militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American president, and engaging in stochastic terrorism.\nResearch suggests Trump's rhetoric is associated with an increased incidence of hate crimes, and that he has an emboldening effect on expressing prejudicial attitudes due to his normalization of explicit racial rhetoric. During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters. Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes cited his rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive leniency. A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases, from August 2015 to April 2020, in which he was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against minorities. Trump's refusal to condemn the white supremacist Proud Boys during a 2020 presidential debate and his comment, \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by\", were said to have led to increased recruitment for the pro-Trump group. Counterterrorism researchers described his normalization and revisionist history of the January 6 Capitol attack, and grant of clemency to all January 6 rioters, as encouraging future political violence.\n\n\n=== Conspiracy theories ===\n\nSince before his first presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama \"birtherism\", climate change denial, and alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections. After the 2020 presidential election, he promoted conspiracy theories for his defeat that were characterized as \"the big lie\".\n\n\n=== False or misleading statements ===\n\nTrump frequently makes false statements in public remarks to an extent unprecedented in American politics. His falsehoods are a distinctive part of his political identity and have been described as firehosing. His false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied 30,573 false or misleading statements made by him during his first presidency, increasing in frequency over time.\nSome of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, while others had more far-reaching effects, such as his unproven promotion of antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19, causing a U.S. shortage of these drugs and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia. Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror\", served his domestic political purposes. His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices weakened public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it. He habitually does not apologize for his falsehoods. Until 2018, the media rarely referred to his falsehoods as lies, including when he repeated demonstrably false statements.\n\n\n=== Social media ===\n\nTrump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He posted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until Twitter banned him after the January 6 attack. He often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press; in 2017, his press secretary said that his tweets constituted official presidential statements.\nAfter years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checks in May 2020. In response, he said social media platforms \"totally silence\" conservatives and he would \"strongly regulate, or close them down\". After the January 6 attack, he was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other platforms. The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events and correlated with a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation on Twitter. In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he attracted a fraction of his Twitter following. Elon Musk, after acquiring Twitter, reinstated his Twitter account in November 2022. Meta Platforms' two-year ban lapsed in January 2023, allowing him to return to Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\n=== Relationship with the press ===\n\nTrump sought media attention throughout his career, maintaining a \"love-hate\" relationship with the press. In the 2016 campaign, he benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, estimated at $2 billion. As a candidate and as president, he frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".\nThe first Trump presidency reduced formal press briefings from about one hundred in 2017 to about half that in 2018 and to two in 2019; they also revoked the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about his stance on Russian election interference. All the suits were dismissed. By 2024, Trump repeatedly voiced support for outlawing political dissent and criticism, and said that reporters should be prosecuted for not divulging confidential sources and media companies should possibly lose their broadcast licenses for unfavorable coverage of him.\nFollowing his reelection, Trump launched lawsuits and created blacklists against certain media outlets, and took over the process run by the White House Correspondents' Association to choose what outlets have access to him. Rather than comply with a court order to restore Associated Press access, the White House made a policy of limited access for all wire services. The Federal Communications Commission launched investigations into media outlets accused of bias against him.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Family ===\n\nIn 1977, Trump married Ivana. They had three children: Donald Jr. (b. 1977), Ivanka (b. 1981), and Eric (b. 1984). The couple divorced in 1990, following his affair with model and actress Marla Maples. He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (b. 1993), whom Maples raised in California. In 2005, he married Slovenian model Melania Knauss. They have one son, Barron (b. 2006).\n\n\n=== Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein ===\nTrump had a 15-year friendship with Jeffrey Epstein; persons who knew them at the time said they frequently hit on and competed for women. Media attention and public pressure mounted in 2025, when his administration did not release files relating to Epstein, despite Trump's promise to do so during the 2024 campaign.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nTrump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs. He sleeps about four or five hours a night. He has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\", but usually does not walk the course. He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\", which is depleted by exercise. In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that he would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\". In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump's agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on Bornstein's office.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nTrump said in 2016 that he was a Presbyterian and a Protestant. In 2020, he said he was a nondenominational Christian. However, many have questioned the depth of these religious affiliations. A survey during Trump's first presidency (2017–2021) showed that 63 percent of Americans did not believe he was religious, despite his professed Christian affiliation, and that only 44 percent of Americans believed that Trump was a Christian. Some of Trump's comments on the Bible or Christian practice have led critical observers to suggest that his knowledge of Christianity is superficial or erroneous, and few biographers have described Trump as deeply or even particularly religious.\nIn his first term, Trump appointed his personal pastor and spiritual advisor, millionaire televangelist Paula White-Cain, to the White House Office of Public Liaison. In his second term, he appointed her senior advisor to the newly created White House Faith Office.\n\n\n== Assessments ==\n\n\n=== Public image ===\n\nIn Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2020, international approval ratings of U.S. leadership dropped from about 22 percent in a Gallup poll of 134 countries to just 16 percent—lower than China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin—in a Pew Research poll of 13 countries. In 2017, estimation of U.S. leadership declined most among allies.\nDomestically, in his first term, Trump had chiefly partisan support: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats. In a 2021 Gallup poll, he was the only president never to reach a 50 percent approval rating, and he was the first not to be named most admired in his first year in office.\nIn his second term's first quarter according to Gallup, Trump's approval rating was 45 percent—somewhat better than his first term, and far below the 60 percent average of other presidents. Support remained polarized; he had the approval of 90 percent among Republicans, 37 percent among independents, and 4 percent among Democrats.\n\n\n=== Scholarly rankings ===\n\nIn C-SPAN's 2021 survey of presidential historians, historians ranked Trump as the fourth-worst president. He rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills. The Siena College Research Institute's 2022 survey ranked him third-worst. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership, and ranked last in several categories. In 2018 and 2024, members of the American Political Science Association ranked him the worst president.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of awards and honors received by Donald Trump\nPseudonyms used by Donald Trump\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\n​​​​​\n\n\n=== Journals ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMercieca, Jennifer R.

        "title": "Ozzy Osbourne",
        "content": "John Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (3 December 1948 – 22 July 2025) was an English singer, songwriter, and media personality. He co-founded the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath in 1968, and rose to prominence in the 1970s as their lead vocalist. During this time, he adopted the title \"Prince of Darkness\". He performed on the band's first eight studio albums, including Black Sabbath, Paranoid (both 1970) and Master of Reality (1971), before he was fired in 1979 due to his problems with alcohol and other drugs.\nOsbourne began a solo career in the 1980s and formed his band with Randy Rhoads and Bob Daisley, with whom he recorded the albums Blizzard of Ozz (1980) and Diary of a Madman (1981). Throughout the decade, he drew controversy for his antics both onstage and offstage, and was accused of promoting Satanism by the Christian right. Overall, Osbourne released thirteen solo studio albums, the first seven of which were certified multi-platinum in the United States. He reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions. He rejoined from 1997 to 2005, and again in 2012; during this second reunion, he sang on the band's last studio album, 13 (2013), before they embarked on a farewell tour that ended in 2017. On 5 July 2025, Osbourne performed his final show at the Back to the Beginning concert in Birmingham, having announced that it would be his last due to health issues. Although he intended to continue recording music, he died 17 days later.\nOsbourne sold more than 100 million albums, including his solo work and Black Sabbath releases. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Black Sabbath in 2006 and as a solo artist in 2024. He was also inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame both solo and with Black Sabbath in 2005. He was honoured with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 12 April 2002 and Birmingham Walk of Stars on 6 July 2007. At the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards, he received the Global Icon Award. In 2015, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.\nOsbourne's wife and manager Sharon founded the heavy metal touring festival Ozzfest, which was held yearly from 1996 to 2010. In the early 2000s, he became a reality television star when he appeared in the MTV reality show The Osbournes (2002–2005) alongside Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack. He co-starred with some of his family in the television series Ozzy & Jack's World Detour (2016–2018) as well as The Osbournes Want to Believe (2020–2021).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJohn Michael Osbourne was born at the maternity hospital in Marston Green (then in Warwickshire) on 3 December 1948, and grew up in the Aston area of Birmingham. His mother, Lilian (née Unitt; 1916–2001), was a non-observant Catholic who worked at a Lucas factory. His father, John Thomas \"Jack\" Osbourne (1915–1977), worked night shifts as a toolmaker at the General Electric Company. Osbourne had three older sisters named Jean, Iris and Gillian, and two younger brothers named Paul and Tony. The family lived in a small two-bedroom home at 14 Lodge Road in Aston. Osbourne gained the nickname \"Ozzy\" as a child. He dealt with dyslexia at school. His accent was described as \"hesitant Brummie\".\nAt the age of 11, Osbourne suffered sexual abuse from school bullies. He said he attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager. He participated in school plays, including Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado and H.M.S. Pinafore. Upon hearing the first hit single of the Beatles at age 14, he became a fan of the band and credited their 1963 song \"She Loves You\" with inspiring him to become a musician. In the 2011 documentary God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, Osbourne said that the Beatles made him realise that \"[he] was going to be a rock star the rest of [his] life\".\nOsbourne left school at the age of 15 and was employed as a construction site labourer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner and slaughterhouse worker. At the age of 17, he was convicted of robbing a clothes shop, but was unable to pay the fine; his father also refused to pay it to teach him a lesson, resulting in Osbourne spending six weeks in Winson Green Prison.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\n\n\n=== Black Sabbath ===\n\nIn late 1967, Geezer Butler formed his first band, Rare Breed, and recruited Osbourne to be the singer. The band played two shows and broke up. Osbourne and Butler reunited in another band, Polka Tulk Blues, which included guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward, whose band Mythology had recently broken up. They renamed the band Earth, but after being accidentally booked for a show instead of a different band with the same name, they decided to change the band's name again, settling on the name Black Sabbath in August 1969. The band's name was inspired by the film of the same title. Black Sabbath noticed how people enjoyed being frightened during their appearances, which inspired their decision to play a heavy blues style of music laced with gloomy sounds and lyrics. While recording their first album, Butler read an occult book and woke up seeing a dark figure at the end of his bed. Butler told Osbourne about it, and together they wrote the lyrics to \"Black Sabbath\", their first song in a darker vein.\n\nThe band's US record label, Warner Bros. Records, invested only modestly in it, but Black Sabbath achieved swift and enduring success. Built around Tony Iommi's guitar riffs, Geezer Butler's lyrics, Bill Ward's dark tempo drumbeats, and topped by Osbourne's eerie vocals, their debut album, Black Sabbath, and second, Paranoid, were commercially successful and also gained considerable radio airplay. Osbourne recalled, however, that, \"in those days, the band wasn't very popular with the women\". At about this time, Osbourne first met his future wife, Sharon Arden. After the unexpected success of their first album, Black Sabbath were considering her father, Don Arden, as their new manager, and Sharon was at that time working as Don's receptionist. Osbourne admitted he was attracted to her immediately but assumed that \"she probably thought I was a lunatic\". Osbourne later recalled that the best thing about eventually choosing Don Arden as manager was that he got to see Sharon regularly, though their relationship was strictly professional at that point.\nFive months after the release of Paranoid, the band released Master of Reality. The album reached the top ten in both the United States and UK, and was certified gold in less than two months. In the 1980s, it received platinum certification and went Double Platinum in the early 21st century. Reviews of the album were unfavourable. Lester Bangs of Rolling Stone famously dismissed Master of Reality as \"naïve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel\", although the very same magazine would later place the album at number 298 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, compiled in 2003.\nIn September 1972, Black Sabbath released Black Sabbath Vol. 4. Critics were dismissive of the album; however, it reached gold status in less than a month and was the band's fourth consecutive album to sell more than one million copies in the United States. In November 1973, Black Sabbath released the critically acclaimed Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. For the first time, the band received favourable reviews in the mainstream press. Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone called the album \"an extraordinarily gripping affair\" and \"nothing less than a complete success\". Decades later, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album a \"masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection\", while also claiming the band displayed \"a newfound sense of finesse and maturity\". The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the United States. Sabotage was released in July 1975. Again, there were favourable reviews. Rolling Stone stated, \"Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever.\" In a retrospective review, AllMusic was less favourable, noting that \"the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate\". Technical Ecstasy, released on 25 September 1976, was also met with mixed reviews. AllMusic gives the album two stars, and notes that the band was \"unravelling at an alarming rate\".\n\n\n==== Dismissal ====\n\nBetween late 1977 and early 1978, Osbourne left the band for three months to pursue a solo project called Blizzard of Ozz, a title which had been suggested by his father. Three members of the band Necromandus, who had supported Sabbath in Birmingham when they were called Earth, backed Osbourne in the studio and briefly became the first incarnation of his solo band.\nAt the request of the other band members, Osbourne rejoined Sabbath. The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, where they wrote and recorded their next album, Never Say Die! \"It took quite a long time\", Iommi said of Never Say Die! \"We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned; we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right; we were all over the place, and everybody was playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day.\"\nIn May 1978, Black Sabbath began the Never Say Die! Tour with Van Halen as an opening act. Reviewers called Sabbath's performance \"tired and uninspired\" in stark contrast to the \"youthful\" performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time. The band recorded their concert at Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978, which was released on video as Never Say Die. The final show of the tour and Osbourne's last appearance with Black Sabbath for another seven years, until 1985, was in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 11 December.\nIn 1979, Black Sabbath returned to the studio, but tension and conflict arose between band members. Osbourne recalled being asked to record his vocals over and over, and tracks were manipulated endlessly by Iommi. The relationship between Osbourne and Iommi became contentious. On 27 April 1979, at Iommi's insistence but with the support of Butler and Ward, Osbourne was ejected from Black Sabbath. The reasons provided to him were that he was unreliable and had excessive substance abuse issues compared to the other members. Osbourne maintained that his use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs at that time was similar to that of the other members.\nThe band replaced Osbourne with former Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio. In a 21 August 1987 interview with Tommy Vance on BBC Radio 1's Friday Rock Show, Dio said, \"I was not, and never will be, Ozzy Osbourne. He was the vocalist and songwriter in that era who helped create that band and make it what it was, and what it is in its classic form.\"\nThe conflict between Iommi and Osbourne commenced almost immediately in their working collaboration. Responding to a flyer that read, \"Ozzy Zig Needs Gig- has own PA\", which was posted by Osbourne in a record store, Iommi and Ward arrived at the listed address to speak with Ozzy Zig, as he then called himself. When Iommi saw Osbourne emerge from another room of the house, he recalled that he knew him as a \"pest\" from their school days. Iommi recalls one incident in the early 1970s in which Osbourne and Butler were fighting in a hotel room. Iommi pulled Osbourne off Butler in an attempt to break up the drunken fight, and the vocalist proceeded to turn around and take a wild swing at him. Iommi responded by knocking Osbourne unconscious with one punch to the jaw.\n\n\n==== Black Sabbath reunions ====\n\nFollowing two brief, short-set reunions for Live Aid in 1985 and at an Ozzy Osbourne show in Costa Mesa, California, on 15 November 1992, Osbourne, Iommi and Butler formally reunited as Black Sabbath in 1997 for the 1997 Ozzfest shows. Ward was absent due to health issues. In December 1997, all four members of the band reunited to record the album Reunion. Osbourne also toured with the band again from 1997 to 1999 for the album's concert tour. The album proved to be a commercial success upon its release in October 1998.\nThe original Black Sabbath line-up of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward reunited in November 2011 for a world tour and new album. Ward had to drop out for contractual reasons, so the project continued with Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk stepping in for Ward on drums. They played their first reunion concert in May 2012, at the O2 Academy in their hometown Birmingham. The album, entitled 13, was released on 11 June 2013, and topped both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200.\nIn January 2016, the band began a farewell tour, titled \"The End\", supposedly signifying the final performances of Black Sabbath. The final shows of The End tour took place at the Genting Arena in their home city of Birmingham on 2 and 4 February 2017, where Tommy Clufetos replaced Bill Ward as the drummer for the final show.\nOn 8 August 2022, Osbourne and Iommi made a surprise appearance during the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. This marked Osbourne's first live performance in three years, following a period of ill health.\nOsbourne played his final show, billed as \"Back to the Beginning\", alongside the original line-up of Black Sabbath, at Villa Park in Birmingham on 5 July 2025. The band and Osbourne each played a short set, watched by a crowd of more than 40,000 spectators and a peak livestream audience of 5.8 million. Having been rendered unable to stand from Parkinson's disease, Osbourne performed seated on a black throne. All proceeds from the event were donated equally to The Cure Parkinson's Trust, Birmingham Children's Hospital, and Acorn Children's Hospice.\n\n\n=== Solo career ===\n\n\n==== Signing to Jet Records ====\n\nAfter leaving Black Sabbath, Osbourne recalled, \"I'd got £96,000 for my share of the name, so I'd just locked myself away and spent three months doing coke and booze. My thinking was, 'This is my last party, because after this I'm going back to Birmingham and the dole.\" However, Don Arden signed him to Jet Records with the aim of recording new material. Arden dispatched his daughter Sharon to Los Angeles to \"look after Ozzy's needs, whatever they were\", to protect his investment. Arden initially hoped Osbourne would return to Sabbath, who he was personally managing at that time, and later attempted to convince the singer to name his new band \"Son of Sabbath\", which Osbourne hated. Sharon attempted to convince Osbourne to form a supergroup with guitarist Gary Moore. \"When I lived in Los Angeles\", Moore recalled, \"[Moore's band] G-Force helped him to audition musicians. If drummers were trying out, I played guitar, and if a bassist came along, my drummer would help out. We felt sorry for him, basically. He was always hovering around trying to get me to join, and I wasn't having any of it.\"\n\n\n==== Blizzard of Ozz ====\nIn late 1979, under the management of the Ardens, Osbourne formed the Blizzard of Ozz, featuring bassist-lyricist Bob Daisley (of Rainbow and, later, Uriah Heep), guitarist Randy Rhoads (of Quiet Riot), drummer Lee Kerslake (of Uriah Heep), and keyboardist Don Airey (of Rainbow and, later, Deep Purple) as a session musician. The record company eventually titled the group's debut album Blizzard of Ozz, credited simply to Osbourne, thus commencing his solo career. Co-written with Daisley and Rhoads, it brought Osbourne considerable success on his first solo effort. Though it is generally accepted that Osbourne and Rhoads started the band, Daisley later claimed that he and Osbourne formed the band in England before Rhoads officially joined.\nBlizzard of Ozz is one of the few albums among the 100 best-sellers of the 1980s to have achieved multi-platinum status without the benefit of a top-40 single. As of August 1997, it had achieved quadruple platinum status, according to RIAA. \"I envied Ozzy's career...\" remarked former Sabbath drummer Bill Ward. \"He seemed to be coming around from whatever it was that he'd gone through, and he seemed to be on his way again; making records and stuff... I envied it because I wanted that... I was bitter. And I had a thoroughly miserable time.\"\n\n\n==== Diary of a Madman and Speak of the Devil ====\n\nOsbourne's second album, Diary of a Madman, featured more songs co-written with Lee Kerslake. For his work on this album and Blizzard of Ozz, Rhoads was ranked the 85th-greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine in 2003. This album is known for the singles \"Over the Mountain\" and \"Flying High Again\" and, as Osbourne explained in his autobiography, was his personal favourite. Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo soon replaced Kerslake and Daisley. Aldridge had been Osbourne's original choice for drummer, but a commitment to Gary Moore had made him unavailable.\nOn 19 March 1982, the band was in Florida for its Diary of a Madman tour, a week away from playing Madison Square Garden in New York City. A light aircraft piloted by Andrew Aycock, the band's tour bus driver, carrying Rhoads and Rachel Youngblood, the band's costume and make-up designer, crashed while performing low passes over the band's tour bus. The left wing of the aircraft clipped the bus, causing the plane to graze a tree and crash into the garage of a nearby mansion, killing Rhoads, Aycock, and Youngblood. The crash was ruled the result of \"poor judgement by the pilot in buzzing the bus and misjudging clearance of obstacles\". Experiencing first-hand the horrific death of his close friend and bandmate, Osbourne fell into a deep depression. The tour was cancelled for two weeks while Osbourne, Sharon, and Aldridge returned to Los Angeles to take stock while Sarzo remained in Florida with family.\n\nGary Moore was the first to be approached to replace Rhoads, but refused. With a two-week deadline to find a new guitarist and resume the tour, Robert Sarzo, brother of the band's bassist Rudy Sarzo, was chosen to replace Rhoads. Former Gillan guitarist Bernie Tormé, however, flew to California from England with the promise from Jet Records that he had the job. Once Sharon realised that Jet Records had already paid Tormé an advance, he was reluctantly hired instead of Sarzo. The tour resumed on 1 April 1982, but Tormé's blues-based style was unpopular with fans. After a handful of shows he informed Sharon that he would be returning to England to continue work on a solo album he had begun before coming to the United States.\nAt an audition in a hotel room, Osbourne selected Night Ranger's Brad Gillis to finish the tour. The tour culminated in the release of the 1982 live album Speak of the Devil, recorded at The Ritz in New York City. A live tribute album for Rhoads was also later released. Despite the difficulties, Osbourne moved on after Rhoads's death. Speak of the Devil, known in the United Kingdom as Talk of the Devil, was originally planned to consist of live recordings from 1981, primarily from Osbourne's solo work. Under contract to produce a live album, it ended up consisting entirely of Sabbath covers recorded with Gillis, Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge. In 1982, Osbourne appeared as lead vocalist on the Was (Not Was) pop dance track \"Shake Your Head (Let's Go to Bed)\". Remixed and rereleased in the early 1990s for a Was (Not Was) hits album in Europe, it reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\n==== Bark at the Moon, The Ultimate Sin and No Rest for the Wicked ====\n\nIn 1983, Jake E. Lee, formerly of Ratt and Rough Cutt, joined Osbourne to record Bark at the Moon. The album, cowritten with Daisley, featured Aldridge and former Rainbow keyboard player Don Airey. The album's title track, whose video was partially filmed at Holloway Sanitorium outside London, became a fan favourite. Within weeks the album became certified gold. It has sold three million copies in the United States. 1986's The Ultimate Sin followed (with bassist Phil Soussan and drummer Randy Castillo), and touring behind both albums with former Uriah Heep keyboardist John Sinclair joining prior to the Ultimate Sin tour. At the time of its release, The Ultimate Sin was Osbourne's highest-charting studio album. The RIAA awarded the album Platinum status on 14 May 1986, soon after its release; it was awarded Double Platinum status on 26 October 1994.\nJake E. Lee and Osbourne parted ways in 1987. Osbourne continued to struggle with chemical dependency. That year, he commemorated the fifth anniversary of Rhoads's death with Tribute, a collection of live recordings from 1981. In 1988, Osbourne appeared in The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years and told the director Penelope Spheeris that \"sobriety fucking sucks\". Meanwhile, Osbourne found Zakk Wylde, who was the most enduring replacement for Rhoads to date. Together, they recorded No Rest for the Wicked with Castillo on drums, Sinclair on keyboards, and Daisley co-writing lyrics and playing bass. The subsequent tour saw Osbourne reunited with erstwhile Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler on bass. A live EP (entitled Just Say Ozzy) featuring Geezer was released two years later. In 1988, Osbourne performed on the rock ballad \"Close My Eyes Forever\", a duet with Lita Ford, reaching No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1989, Osbourne performed at the Moscow Music Peace Festival.\n\n\n==== No More Tears and Ozzmosis ====\n\nOsbourne's commercial success of the 1980s continued with 1991's No More Tears, featuring \"Mama, I'm Coming Home\". The album enjoyed much radio and MTV exposure. It also initiated a practice of bringing in outsiders (in this case Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead) to help write Osbourne's material, instead of relying on his recording ensemble. The album was mixed by veteran rock producer Michael Wagener. Osbourne was awarded a 1994 Grammy for the track \"I Don't Want to Change the World\" from Live & Loud, for Best Metal Performance. Wagener also mixed the live album Live & Loud released on 28 June 1993. Intended to be Osbourne's final album, it went platinum four times over, and had a peak ranking of number 22 on the Billboard 200 chart. In 1992, Osbourne expressed his fatigue with touring, and proclaimed his \"retirement tour\" (the retirement was to be short-lived), called \"No More Tours\", a pun on No More Tears. Alice in Chains's Mike Inez took over on bass and Kevin Jones played keyboards as Sinclair was touring with the Cult.\nOsbourne's entire CD catalogue was remastered and reissued in 1995. The same year, Osbourne released Ozzmosis and resumed touring, dubbing his concert performances \"The Retirement Sucks Tour\". The album reached number 4 on the US Billboard 200. The RIAA certified the album gold and platinum in that same year, and double platinum in April 1999.\nThe line-up on Ozzmosis was Wylde, Butler (who had recently quit Black Sabbath again), Steve Vai, and Hardline drummer Deen Castronovo, who later joined Journey. Keyboards were played by Rick Wakeman and producer Michael Beinhorn. The tour maintained Butler and Castronovo and saw Sinclair return, but a major line-up change was the introduction of former David Lee Roth guitarist Joe Holmes. Wylde was considering an offer to join Guns N' Roses. Unable to wait for a decision on Wylde's departure, Osbourne replaced him. In early 1996, Butler and Castronovo left. Inez and Randy Castillo (Lita Ford, Mötley Crüe) filled in. Ultimately, Faith No More's Mike Bordin and former Suicidal Tendencies and future Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo joined on drums and bass respectively. A greatest hits package, The Ozzman Cometh, was issued in 1997.\n\n\n==== Down to Earth ====\n\nDown to Earth, Osbourne's first album of new studio material in six years, was released on 16 October 2001. A live album, Live at Budokan, followed in 2002. Down to Earth, which achieved platinum status in 2003, featured the single \"Dreamer\", a song which peaked at number 10 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks. In June 2002, Osbourne was invited to participate in the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, performing the Black Sabbath anthem \"Paranoid\" at the Party at the Palace concert in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. In 2003, Osbourne recruited former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted, though his time with Osbourne would be short. Osbourne's former bassist Robert Trujillo replaced Newsted in Metallica during this same period.\nOn 8 December 2003, Osbourne was rushed into emergency surgery at Slough's Wexham Park Hospital following an accident with his quad bike on his estate in Jordans, Buckinghamshire. Osbourne broke his collar bone, eight ribs, and a neck vertebra. An operation was performed to lift the collarbone, which was believed to be resting on a major artery and interrupting blood flow to one of Osbourne's arms. Sharon later revealed that Osbourne had stopped breathing following the crash and was resuscitated by Osbourne's then personal bodyguard, Sam Ruston. While in hospital, Osbourne achieved his first ever UK number one single, a duet of the Black Sabbath ballad, \"Changes\" with daughter Kelly. In doing so, he broke the record of the longest period between an artist's first UK chart appearance (with Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\", number four in August 1970) and their first number one hit: a gap of 33 years. He recovered from the quad accident and went on to headline the 2004 Ozzfest, with the reunited Black Sabbath.\n\n\n==== Box set release and Black Rain ====\n\nIn March 2005, Osbourne released a box set called Prince of Darkness. The first and second discs are collections of live performances, B-sides, demos and singles. The third disc contained duets and other odd tracks with other artists, including \"Born to Be Wild\" with Miss Piggy. The fourth disc, is entirely new material where Osbourne covers his favourite songs by his biggest influences and favourite bands, including the Beatles, John Lennon, David Bowie and others. In November 2005, Osbourne released the covers album Under Cover, featuring 10 songs from the fourth disc of Prince of Darkness and 3 more songs. Osbourne's band for this album included Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell, bassist Chris Wyse and Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin.\nOsbourne also helped judge the 2005 UK series of the X-Factor where his wife Sharon was one of the main judges. In March 2006, he said that he hoped to release a new studio album soon with longtime on-off guitarist, Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society. In October 2006, it was announced that Tony Iommi, Ronnie James Dio, Bill Ward, and Geezer Butler would be touring together again, though not as Black Sabbath but under the moniker \"Heaven & Hell\", the title of Dio's first Black Sabbath album.\nOsbourne's next album, titled Black Rain, was released on 22 May 2007. His first new studio album in almost six years, it featured a more serious tone than previous albums. \"I thought I'd never write again without any stimulation... But you know what? Instead of picking up the bottle I just got honest and said, 'I don't want life to go [to pieces]'\", Osbourne stated to Billboard magazine.\n\n\n==== Band changes and Scream ====\n\nOsbourne revealed in July 2009 that he was currently seeking a new guitar player. While he stated that he had not fallen out with Zakk Wylde, he said he felt his songs were beginning to sound like Black Label Society and fancied a change. In August 2009, Osbourne performed at the gaming festival BlizzCon with a new guitarist in his line-up, Gus G. Osbourne also provided his voice and likeness to the video game Brütal Legend character The Guardian of Metal. In November, Slash featured Osbourne on vocals in his single \"Crucify the Dead\", and Osbourne with wife Sharon were guest hosts on WWE Raw. In December, Osbourne announced he would be releasing a new album titled Soul Sucka with Gus G, Tommy Clufetos on drums, and Blasko on bass. Negative fan feedback was brought to Osbourne's attention regarding the album title. In respect of fan opinion, on 29 March Osbourne announced his album would be renamed Scream.\nOn 13 April 2010, Osbourne announced the release date for Scream would be 15 June 2010. The release date was later changed to a week later. A single from the album, \"Let Me Hear You Scream\", debuted on 14 April 2010 episode of CSI: NY.\nOn 9 August 2010, Osbourne announced that the second single from the album would be \"Life Won't Wait\" and the video for the song would be directed by his son Jack. When asked of his opinions on Scream in an interview, Osbourne announced that he was \"already thinking about the next album\". Osbourne's current drummer, Tommy Clufetos, has reflected this sentiment, saying that \"We are already coming up with new ideas backstage, in the hotel rooms and at soundcheck and have a bunch of ideas recorded\". In October 2014, Osbourne released Memoirs of a Madman, a collection celebrating his entire solo career. A CD version contained 17 singles from across his career, never before compiled together. The DVD version contained music videos, live performances, and interviews.\n\n\n==== New music and touring ====\n\nIn August 2015, Epic Records president Sylvia Rhone confirmed with Billboard that Osbourne was working on another studio album; in September 2019, Osbourne announced he had finished the album in four weeks following his collaboration with Post Malone. In April 2017, it was announced that guitarist Zakk Wylde would reunite with Osbourne for a summer tour to mark the 30th anniversary of their first collaboration on 1988's No Rest for the Wicked. The first show of the tour took place on 14 July at the Rock USA Festival in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.\nOn 6 November 2017, Osbourne was announced as the headline act for the Sunday of the 2018 Download Festival held annually at Donington Park in Leicestershire, England. Having previously graced the main stage in previous years fronting Black Sabbath, this would be his first-ever Download headline solo appearance. The Download Festival set came as part of Osbourne's final world tour announcement that morning.\nOn 6 February 2018, Osbourne announced that he would embark on his final world tour dubbed No More Tours II, a reference to his 1992 tour of the same name, with support from Stone Sour on the North American portion of the tour. He later insisted that he would not retire, \"It's 'No More Tours', so I'm just not doing world tours anymore. I'm still going to be doing gigs, but I'm not going on tour for six months at a time anymore. I'd like to spend some time at home.\"\nOn 6 September 2019, Osbourne featured on the song \"Take What You Want\" by Post Malone. The song peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 charts at number 8, making it Osbourne's first US Top 10 single in 30 years since he was featured on Lita Ford's \"Close My Eyes Forever\".\n\n\n==== Ordinary Man and Patient Number 9 ====\nOn 21 February 2020, Osbourne released his first solo album in almost ten years, Ordinary Man, which received positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart. A few days after the release, Osbourne told iHeartRadio that he wanted to make another album with Andrew Watt, the main producer of Ordinary Man. One week after the release of the album, an 8-bit video game dedicated to Osbourne was released, called Legend of Ozzy. Following the release Osbourne then started working on his follow up album, once again with Andrew Watt. In November 2021, Sony announced that Osbourne's album would be released within six months; it was also announced that Zakk Wylde will have full involvement in the album following his absence on Ordinary Man.\nOn 24 June 2022, Osbourne announced his thirteenth album would be titled Patient Number 9 and released the title track alongside an accompanying music video that same day. The album was released on 9 September 2022. Osbourne then had his first live performances in three years with two brief concerts at sporting events: on 30 August, he performed \"Iron Man\" and \"Paranoid\" at the 2022 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in Birmingham, joined by Iommi and former touring members of Black Sabbath Tommy Clufetos and Adam Wakeman; and on 8 September, at the 2022 NFL Kickoff held at Inglewood's SoFi Stadium, Osbourne performed both \"Patient Number 9\" and \"Crazy Train\", with his backing band being Zakk Wylde, Tommy Clufetos, Chris Chaney and the album's producer Andrew Watt.\n\n\n==== No More Tours II tour ====\nIn January 2023, Osbourne announced that the European leg of the No More Tours II would be cancelled after almost two years of being postponed. Osbourne effectively retired from touring, citing his accident in 2019 which resulted in the singer suffering spinal damage, while affirming his plan to continue smaller-scale live performances as his health permitted. In September 2023, he revealed that he was working on a new album with a planned 2024 release while also preparing to go on the road following a successful spinal surgery earlier that month.\nIn 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Osbourne at number 112 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\n\n== Other work ==\n\n\n=== Ozzfest ===\n\nOsbourne's biggest financial success of the 1990s was a venture named Ozzfest, created and overseen by his wife and manager Sharon and assisted by his son Jack, after Ozzy was turned down by the organisers of the Lollapalooza festival. The first Ozzfest was held in York, Pennsylvania, on 20 September 1996. Ozzfest was an instant hit with metal fans, helping many up-and-coming groups who were featured there to broad exposure and commercial success. Some acts shared the bill with a reformed Black Sabbath during the 1997 Ozzfest tour, with the first two shows in Bristow, Virginia and West Palm Beach, Florida.\nFrom its inception to 2005, more than four million people attended Ozzfest, and it grossed more than US$170 million over the same period. The festival helped promote many new hard rock and heavy metal acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Ozzfest helped Osbourne to become the first hard rock and heavy metal star to hit $50 million in merchandise sales. In 2005, Osbourne and his wife Sharon starred in an MTV competition reality show entitled Battle for Ozzfest. A number of yet unsigned bands send one member to compete in a challenge to win a spot on the 2005 Ozzfest and a possible recording contract. During Ozzfest 2005, after having missed several shows due to ill health, Osbourne announced that he was retiring from the event. He did in fact return to Ozzfest in 2006, but with a reduced schedule, leaving many of the concerts to be closed by System of a Down instead of himself.\nTickets for the 2007 tour were offered to fans free of charge, which led to some controversy. In 2008, Ozzfest was reduced to a one-day event in Dallas, where Osbourne played, alongside Metallica and King Diamond. In 2010, the tour opened with a Jersey Shore spoof skit starring Osbourne. Osbourne appeared as the headliner closing the show after opening acts Halford and Mötley Crüe. The tour, though small (only six US venues and one UK venue were played), generated rave reviews.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\nOsbourne achieved greater celebrity status through the MTV reality television series The Osbournes. Created by his wife Sharon, the show follows the home life of Ozzy Osbourne and his family (wife Sharon, children Jack and Kelly, occasional appearances from his son Louis, but eldest daughter Aimee did not participate). The programme became one of MTV's greatest hits. It premiered on 5 March 2002, and the final episode aired on 21 March 2005.\nThe success of The Osbournes led Osbourne and the rest of his family to host the 30th Annual American Music Awards in January 2003. The night was marked with constant \"bleeping\" due to some of the lewd and raunchy remarks made by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. Presenter Patricia Heaton walked out midway in disgust. On 20 February 2008, Ozzy, Sharon, Kelly and Jack Osbourne hosted the 2008 BRIT Awards held at Earls Court, London. Ozzy appeared in a TV commercial for I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! which began airing in the UK in February 2006.\nOsbourne appears in a commercial for the online video game World of Warcraft. He was also featured in the music video game Guitar Hero World Tour as a playable character. He becomes unlocked upon completing \"Mr. Crowley\" and \"Crazy Train\" in the vocalist career. The 2002 dark fantasy combat flight simulator Savage Skies was initially developed under the title Ozzy's Black Skies and was to feature his likeness as well as songs from both his stint in Black Sabbath as well as his solo career, but licensing issues forced developer iRock Interactive to re-tool the game and release it without the Osbourne branding.\nIn October 2009, Osbourne published I Am Ozzy, his autobiography. He said ghost writer Chris Ayres told him he had enough material for a second book. A film adaptation of I Am Ozzy is also in the works, and Osbourne said he hoped \"an unknown guy from England\" will get the role over an established actor, while Sharon stated she would choose established English actress Carey Mulligan to play her.\nA documentary film about Osbourne's life and career, entitled God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, premiered in April 2011 at the Tribeca Film Festival and was released on DVD in November 2011. The film was produced by Osbourne's son Jack. On 15 May 2013 Osbourne, alongside the current members of Black Sabbath, appeared in an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation titled \"Skin in the Game\". The History Channel premiered a comedy reality television series starring Ozzy Osbourne and his son Jack Osbourne on 24 July 2016, named Ozzy & Jack's World Detour. During each episode Ozzy and Jack visit one or more sites to learn about history from experts, and explore unusual or quirky aspects of their background.\nOsbourne appeared in a November 2017 episode of Gogglebox alongside other UK celebrities such as Ed Sheeran, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK's Stand Up to Cancer fundraising campaign. In November 2017, Osbourne signed on as an ambassador of the rock-themed online Metal Casino, founded by metal music fans in August 2017. In February 2019, Osbourne's merchandising partner announced that Ozzy would have his own branded, online slots game as part of the NetEnt Rocks music-themed portfolio.\nIn 2020, Osbourne voiced King Thrash, king of the rock trolls, for the animated movie Trolls World Tour.\nOzzy announced his final autobiography in July 2025, titled Last Rites, scheduled to be released on October 7.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Public image ===\n\nOzzy Osbourne courted controversy throughout his career. He adopted the title \"Prince of Darkness\", took on a demonic stage persona, and portrayed himself as the \"Madman of Rock\". Many Christian religious groups accused Osbourne of being a Devil worshipper, of promoting Satanism, and of being a harmful influence on teenagers. He was demonised by Protestant fundamentalists such as Jeff Godwin, and by Catholics such as Cardinal John O'Connor, who called his music \"a help to the devil\". Osbourne denied being a Satanist and \"responded with defiance by simply absorbing the charges into his stage persona\". He also struck back by mocking the Christian right in his lyrics, such as the song \"Miracle Man\", which targeted one of Osbourne's main detractors Jimmy Swaggart after his sex scandal. Scholar Christopher M. Moreman compared the controversy to those levelled against the occultist Aleister Crowley. Both were demonised by the media and Christian groups. Osbourne tempted the comparison with his 1980 song \"Mr. Crowley\".\nIn 1981, after signing his first solo record deal, Osbourne bit the head off a dove during a meeting with CBS Records executives in Los Angeles. Apparently, he had planned to release doves into the air as a sign of peace, but due to intoxication, he instead grabbed a dove and bit its head off. He then spat the head out, with blood still dripping from his lips. As security was escorting Osbourne out of the building, he grabbed a second dove and also bit its head off. Due to its controversy, the head-biting act has been parodied and alluded to several times throughout his career and is part of what made Osbourne famous.\n\nOn 20 January 1982, Osbourne bit the head off a bat that he thought was rubber while performing at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Des Moines, Iowa. According to a 2004 Rolling Stone article, the bat was alive at the time; however, 17-year-old Mark Neal, who threw it onto the stage, said it was brought to the show dead. According to Osbourne in the booklet to the 2002 edition of Diary of a Madman, the bat was not only alive but managed to bite him, resulting in Osbourne being vaccinated against rabies. On 20 January 2019, Osbourne commemorated the 37th anniversary of the bat incident by offering an \"Ozzy Plush Bat\" toy \"with detachable head\" for sale on his personal web-store. The site claimed the first batch of toys sold out within hours.\nOn 18 February 1982, while wearing his future wife Sharon's dress for a photoshoot near the Alamo, Osbourne drunkenly urinated on the Alamo Cenotaph erected in honour of those who died at the Battle of the Alamo in Texas, across the street from the actual building. A police officer arrested Osbourne, and he was subsequently banned from the city of San Antonio for a decade.\nOn New Year's Eve 1983, Canadian teenager James Jollimore murdered a woman and her two sons in Halifax, Nova Scotia, reportedly after listening to \"Bark at the Moon\". A friend of Jollimore told the court: \"Jimmy said that every time he listened to the song, he felt strange inside ... He said when he heard it on New Year's Eve, he went out and stabbed someone\".\nIn 1984, California teenager John McCollum committed suicide while listening to Osbourne's \"Suicide Solution\". His parents sued Osbourne (McCollum v. CBS), alleging that the song encouraged their son to kill himself. The prosecutors highlighted the lyrics \"Where to hide, suicide is the only way out\", and claimed that the song also contained subliminal and backmasked messages encouraging suicide. The courts ruled in Osbourne's favour, saying there was no connection between the song and McCollum's suicide. In 1990, Osbourne was similarly sued over the suicides of two other young Americans, Michael Waller (1986) and Harold Hamilton (1988), who allegedly were listening to the song when they ended their lives. The courts once again ruled in Osbourne's favour. The lyrics of \"Suicide Solution\" were written by bandmate Bob Daisley. Osbourne said that the song was about the alcohol-related death of singer Bon Scott and was a warning against the slow suicide of alcoholism, although Daisley stated the lyrics were referring to Osbourne himself and his drinking problems.\nOsbourne admitted to shooting 17 of his own pet cats during a drug-fuelled rampage in the 1980s.\n\n\n=== Songwriting credits and trademark disputes ===\nIn lawsuits filed in 2000 and 2002 which were dismissed by the courts in 2003, former band members Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake, and Phil Soussan stated that Osbourne was delinquent in paying them royalties and had denied them due credit on albums they played on. In November 2003, a Federal Appeals Court unanimously upheld the dismissal by the US District Court for the Central District of California of the lawsuit brought by Daisley and Kerslake. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Osbourne did not owe any royalties or credit to the former band members, who were let go in 1981. To resolve further issues, Ozzy's manager and wife Sharon chose to replace Daisley and Kerslake's contributions on the original masters, replacing them with Robert Trujillo on bass and Mike Bordin on drums. The albums were then reissued. The original tracks were restored for the 30th anniversary of the albums.\nIn July 2010, Osbourne and Tony Iommi decided to discontinue court proceedings over ownership of the Black Sabbath trademark. As reported to Blabbermouth, \"Both parties are glad to put this behind them and to cooperate for the future and would like it to be known that the issue was never personal, it was always business.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nOsbourne had more than 15 tattoos, the earliest of which were the letters O-Z-Z-Y across the knuckles of his left hand. He created this himself as a teenager with a sewing needle and pencil lead.\nA longtime fan of the comedy troupe Monty Python, in a 2010 interview with Us Weekly Osbourne stated, \"My favourite movie is Monty Python's Life of Brian\".\nOsbourne suffered minor burns after a small house fire at his family home in Beverly Hills in January 2013.\nOn his 65th birthday on 3 December 2013, he asked fans to celebrate his birthday by donating to the Royal Marsden cancer charity in London.\nIn 2002, Osbourne and wife Sharon were invited to the White House Correspondents' Association dinner by Fox News Channel correspondent Greta Van Susteren for that year's event. President George W. Bush noted Osbourne's presence by joking, \"The thing about Ozzy is, he's made a lot of big hit recordings – 'Party with the Animals', 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', 'Facing Hell', 'Black Skies' and 'Bloodbath in Paradise'. Ozzy, Mom loves your stuff.\"\n\n\n=== Relationships ===\nOsbourne had six children; three from his first marriage and three from his marriage to Sharon Osbourne.\nIn 1971, Osbourne met his first wife Thelma Riley at the Rum Runner, the Birmingham nightclub where she worked. They were married later that year and children Jessica and Louis were soon born. Osbourne also adopted Riley's five-year-old son Elliot from a previous relationship. Osbourne later referred to his first marriage as \"a terrible mistake\". His use of alcohol and other drugs, coupled with his frequent absences while touring with Black Sabbath, took their toll on his family life; his children later complained that he was not a good father. In the 2011 documentary film God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, produced by his son Jack, Osbourne admitted that he could not even remember when Louis and Jessica were born. Louis later made cameo appearances in The Osbournes. He and Jessica are both actors.\nOsbourne began to date his manager Sharon Arden. Guitarist Randy Rhoads predicted in 1981 that the couple would \"probably get married someday\" despite their constant bickering and the fact that Osbourne was still married to Thelma at the time. Ozzy and Sharon married on 4 July 1982. He later confessed that the Independence Day date was chosen so that he would never forget his anniversary. The couple had three children together: Aimee (born 2 September 1983), Kelly (born 27 October 1984), and Jack (born 8 November 1985). After Jack's birth, Osbourne had a vasectomy. Osbourne had many grandchildren. During their relationship, Osborne had many extra-marital affairs. After Ozzy's wife Sharon learned of his four year extra-marital relationship with hairdresser Michelle Pugh, she attempted suicide.\nOsbourne wrote a song for his daughter Aimee, which appeared as a B-side on his seventh studio album Ozzmosis (1995). At the end of the song, she can be heard saying \"I'll always be your angel\", referring to the song's chorus lyrics. The song \"My Little Man\", which appears on Ozzmosis, was written about his son Jack. He and his family divided time between homes in Buckinghamshire and Los Angeles.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nOsbourne said in 2018, \"I never talk religion. I don't understand organised religion. But I strive to be good, although it feels good to be bad, sometimes\". Certain Christian groups and ministers long denounced Osbourne as an immoral Satanist, which he always dismissed. He responded by mocking the Christian right in some of his lyrics, and parodied Christian evangelists in the film Trick or Treat. In 2022, Osbourne said he felt like he had a \"symbiotic\" relationship with evangelists: \"I've kept them in jobs\". He recalled that he once jokingly joined Christians who were protesting outside his gig: \"I joined them at the end of the line with a broomstick, and stapled on 'Have a Nice Day' and a smiley face on it. They didn't know I was there\".\nOsbourne said in a 1986 interview, \"I'm a Christian. I was christened as a Christian. I used to go to Sunday school. I never took much interest in it because...I didn't\". In a later 1992 interview, he said \"I believe in God. I don't go to church, but I don't think you have to go to church to believe in God.\" The New York Times reported in 1992 that he was a member of the Church of England and prayed before each show.\n\n\n=== Political views ===\nOsbourne wrote in his 2009 autobiography, \"I'm not so comfortable with politicians\". He recalled meeting former British Prime Minister Tony Blair at an awards show: \"I couldn't get over the fact that our young soldiers were dying out in the Middle East and he could still find the time to hang around with pop stars\". Osbourne was critical of Donald Trump. He said the US president was \"acting like a fool\" with his response to COVID-19. He added \"If I was running for president, I would try and find out a little bit about politics. Because the fucking guy you've got in there now doesn't know that much about it\". In 2020, after Trump used Osbourne's song in his campaign, he issued a statement forbidding Trump, or any other campaign, from using his music without approval. In 2024, Osbourne said \"Donald Trump is a felon, right? Correct me if I'm wrong, felons can't own a gun. He can't own a gun, but he could start World War III on his own\".\nJacob Held said that Osbourne's viewpoint was anti war in general, but that he didn't object to using proportionate means in just wars. As an example, Held shows that in the song \"War Pigs\", Osbourne sang against the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as excessive, but in the song \"Thank God for the Bomb\" he supports the policy of nuclear deterrence in the Cold War.\nIn 2022, Osbourne expressed his support for Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion of the country. That year, he dedicated his album Patient Number 9 to Ukraine, and pledged to donate all proceeds to the Third Wave Volunteers organisation. Ozzy and his wife Sharon announced they planned to host two families of Ukrainian refugees at their Buckinghamshire estate.\nOsbourne's wife Sharon, who identifies as Jewish, said shortly after the October 7 attacks on Israel, \"Ozzy is so confused by it all and just keeps asking me to explain why there is so much hatred of Jews\". Around this time, Osbourne said he did not want any association with Kanye West, due to West's antisemitism. In 2024, following calls for a cultural boycott of Israeli artists, he and Sharon were among those who signed an open letter by Creative Community For Peace, in \"support of freedom of expression and against discriminatory boycotts\". In 2025, he and Sharon were among those who signed an open letter calling for an investigation into alleged anti-Israel bias in the BBC's coverage of the Gaza war.\n\n\n=== Views on the LGBTQ+ community ===\nOsbourne was publicly supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, having been friends with prominent LGBTQ musicians such as Elton John and Yungblud. In 1989 he personally apologised for homophobic remarks made by Zakk Wylde at a concert in Long Beach, Los Angeles and reportedly donated to AIDS Walk Long Beach, a fundraising event dedicated to HIV/AIDS research.\nIn 2010, Osbourne expressed disgust at the Westboro Baptist Church when they sang a parody of the song \"Crazy Train\" for a picket they held during the Snyder v. Phelps Supreme Court hearing with lyrics promoting their ideology, stating \"I am sickened and disgusted by the use of 'Crazy Train' to promote messages of hate and evil by a 'church.'\"\n\n\n=== Drug use ===\nOsbourne used tobacco, alcohol, street drugs such as cocaine, and prescription drugs for most of his adult life. He admitted to Sounds in 1978, \"I get high, I get fucked up ... what the hell's wrong with getting fucked up? There must be something wrong with the system if so many people have to get fucked up ... I never take dope or anything before I go on stage. I'll smoke a joint or whatever afterwards.\" Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that while all the band drank alcohol and took other illicit drugs in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all. Despite this, said Iommi, he was typically the only one left standing when the others were \"out for the count\". Upon being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Osbourne spent the next three months locked in his hotel room drinking alcohol and taking vast amounts of drugs \"all day, every day.\"\nOsbourne later commented on his former wild lifestyle, expressing bewilderment at his own survival through 40 years of misusing tobacco, alcohol, street drugs, and prescription drugs. Longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde has attributed Osbourne's longevity in spite of decades of substance abuse to \"a very special kind of fortitude that's bigger than King Kong and Godzilla combined... seriously, he's hard as nails, man!\"\nOsbourne's first experience with cocaine was in early 1971 at a hotel in Denver, Colorado, after a show Black Sabbath had done with Mountain. He states that Mountain's guitarist, Leslie West, introduced him to the drug. Though West was reluctant to take credit for introducing Osbourne to cocaine, Osbourne remembered the experience quite clearly: \"When you come from Aston and you fall in love with cocaine, you remember when you started. It's like having your first fuck!\" Osbourne said that upon first trying the drug, \"The world went a bit fuzzy after that.\"\nOsbourne's substance abuse, at times, caused friction within his band. Don Airey, keyboardist for Osbourne during his early solo career, said that these issues were what ultimately caused him to leave the band. In his memoir Off the Rails, former bassist Rudy Sarzo detailed the frustrations felt by him and his bandmates as they coped with life on the road with Osbourne, who was in a state of near-constant inebriation and was often so hungover that he would refuse to perform. When he was able to perform, his voice was often so damaged from his smoking, drinking, and drug abuse that the performance suffered. Many shows on the American leg of the 1981–82 Diary of a Madman tour were simply cancelled, and the members of his band quickly began to tire of the unpredictability, coupled with the often violent mood swings he was prone to when either drunk or high.\nOsbourne claimed that he would have died if Sharon had not offered to manage him as a solo artist.\nOsbourne claimed in his autobiography that he was invited in 1981 to a meeting with the head of CBS Europe in Germany. Intoxicated, he decided to lighten the mood by performing a striptease on the table and then kissing the record executive on the lips. According to his wife Sharon, he had actually performed a goose-step up and down the table and urinated in the executive's wine, but was too drunk to remember.\nIn February 1982, Osbourne drunkenly fired his entire band, including Randy Rhoads, after they had informed him that they would not participate in a planned live album of Black Sabbath songs. He also physically attacked Rhoads and Rudy Sarzo in a hotel bar that morning, and Sharon informed the band that she feared he had \"finally snapped\". Osbourne later had no memory of firing his band and the tour continued, though his relationship with Rhoads had not fully recovered before Rhoads's death in a plane crash a month later. In May 1984, Osbourne was arrested in Memphis, Tennessee, again for public intoxication. The most notorious incident came in August 1989, when Sharon claimed that Osbourne had tried to strangle her after returning home from the Moscow Music Peace Festival, in a haze of alcohol and other drugs. The incident led Osbourne to six months in rehabilitation, after which time Sharon regained her faith in her husband and did not press charges.\nIn 2003, Osbourne told the Los Angeles Times how he was nearly incapacitated by medication prescribed by a Beverly Hills doctor. The doctor was alleged to have prescribed 13,000 doses of 32 drugs in one year. However, after a nine-year investigation by the Medical Board of California, the Beverly Hills physician was exonerated of all charges of excessive prescribing.\nOsbourne managed to remain clean and sober for extended periods in the late 2000s.\nIn 2010, during an interview on The Howard Stern Show, Osbourne said that it took him 19 attempts to get his driving licence because of his alcohol use.\nAt the TEDMED Conference in October 2010, scientists from Knome, a Massachusetts human genome interpretation company, joined Osbourne on stage to discuss their analysis of Osbourne's whole genome, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker had survived decades of misusing alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.\nIn April 2013, Osbourne revealed through Facebook that he had resumed smoking, drinking, and doing drugs for the past year and a half, stating he \"was in a very dark place\" but said he had been sober again since early March. He also apologised to Sharon, his family, friends, bandmates and his fans for his \"insane\" behaviour during that period. In a February 2021 interview with Variety, Osbourne and his son Jack (who has been sober for 17 years) opened up about their recovery. He revealed he had been sober for about seven years.\n\n\n=== Health issues ===\n\nOsbourne was dyslexic, and suggested he may have had ADHD.\nOsbourne experienced tremors for some years and linked them to his continuous drug abuse. In 2003, he found out it was a genetic form of Parkinson's disease. Osbourne had to take daily medication for the rest of his life to combat the involuntary shudders associated with the condition. He publicly revealed the Parkinson's diagnosis in January 2020, saying, \"I'm not dying from Parkinson's. I've been working with it most of my life.\" Osbourne also showed symptoms of mild hearing loss, as depicted in the television show The Osbournes, where he often asked his family to repeat what they say.\nOn 6 February 2019, Osbourne was hospitalised in an undisclosed location on his doctor's advice due to flu complications, postponing the European leg of his \"No More Tours II\" tour. The issue was described as a \"severe upper-respiratory infection\" following a bout with the flu which his doctor feared could develop into pneumonia, given the physicality of the live performances and an extensive travel schedule throughout Europe in winter conditions.\nBy 12 February 2019, Osbourne had been moved to intensive care. Tour promoters Live Nation said that they were hopeful that Osbourne would be \"fit and healthy\" and able to honour tour dates in both Australia and New Zealand in March. Osbourne later cancelled the tour entirely, and ultimately all shows scheduled for 2019, after sustaining serious injuries from a fall in his Los Angeles home while still recovering from pneumonia. In February 2020, Osbourne cancelled the 2020 North American tour, seeking treatment in Switzerland until April. In 2020, Osbourne also revealed that he had emphysema.\nBy 2025, he had lost his ability to walk due to Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n\nOsbourne died at his home in Buckinghamshire on the morning of 22 July 2025, aged 76, surrounded by his family, 17 days after the Back to the Beginning farewell concert. His primary cause of death was ruled as acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with coronary artery disease and Parkinson's disease with autonomic dysfunction listed as associated factors.\nA number of public figures and musicians shared tributes. Elton John referred to him as \"a dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods – a true legend.\"\nOn 30 July, his funeral cortege left Villa Park, passing Osbourne's childhood home on Lodge Road, and proceeded to Broad Street, which was closed to traffic. It stopped at the Black Sabbath Bridge where Osbourne's family viewed flowers and messages left by fans, and met with the Lord Mayor. The cortege then passed by the Black Sabbath mural on Navigation Street and The Crown where Black Sabbath played their first concert. Tens of thousands of people gathered along the route to observe. That same day, the Band of the Coldstream Guards performed Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\" during the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace. A private funeral was held the following day, attended only by his family and a select gathering of close friends and rock stars, including Elton John, Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Zakk Wylde, James Hetfield, and his Black Sabbath bandmates. In accordance with his wishes, Osbourne was interred on the grounds of his private family estate, Welders House, near a \"beautiful\" lake.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOsbourne was one of the founders of heavy metal music through his work with Black Sabbath and was described by Rolling Stone in 2020 as \"hard rock's comeback kid\". He has been referred to as the \"Godfather of Heavy Metal\" and the \"Madman of Rock\". He disliked being categorised as metal, stating that while his band \"plays heavy\", other bands that are considered metal are \"really heavy\". \"When you get pigeonholed with a certain [genre], it can be very difficult to do something a bit lighter or an acoustic track or whatever you want to do. Back in the day, it was always just rock music. It's still just rock music.\"\nOutside of music, Osbourne and his family's show The Osbournes is regarded as a pioneering reality television programme which ushered in an era of shows focusing on celebrity family life.\nAn exhibition on Osbourne's life was put on display at Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery on 25 June 2025 (prior to his death), featuring memorabilia, photographs, and tributes to his career and legacy. Originally scheduled to close on 28 September 2025, the exhibition was extended to 18 January 2026 following public demand and tributes after his death.\nOn 7 August 2025, the BBC announced a documentary, Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home, which was scheduled to air on 18 August on BBC One and BBC iPlayer. The one-hour programme, filmed over a three-year period, documents Osbourne's return to the United Kingdom, his health challenges, and his final live performance in Birmingham,  which took place just over two weeks before his death. The broadcast was withdrawn from the schedule on 18 August, with the BBC indicating that revised transmission details will follow.\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\nFinal members:\n\nOzzy Osbourne – vocals (1979–1992, 1994–2025)\nZakk Wylde – lead guitar, backing vocals (1987–1992, 1995, 1998, 2001–2004, 2006–2009, 2017–2025)\nMike Inez – bass (1989–1992, 1996, 1998, 2025)\nAdam Wakeman – keyboards, rhythm guitar (2004–2025)\nTommy Clufetos – drums (2010–2025)\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\nOsbourne received several awards for his contributions to the music community.

At the 2004 NME Awards in London, Osbourne received the award for Godlike Genius. In 2005, Osbourne was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame both as a solo artist and as a member of Black Sabbath. In 2006, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Bill Ward, and Geezer Butler. In 2024, Osbourne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for his solo career.\nIn 2007, Osbourne was honoured at the second annual VH1 Rock Honors, alongside Genesis, Heart, and ZZ Top. In addition, that year a bronze star honouring Osbourne was placed in the Birmingham Walk of Stars on Broad Street in the city centre. He was presented the award by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham on 6 July. \"I am really honoured\", he said, \"All my family is here and I thank everyone for this reception—I'm absolutely knocked out\".\nIn 2008, Osbourne was crowned with the prestigious Living Legend award in the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards. Past recipients include Alice Cooper, Lemmy, and Jimmy Page. Slash, the former Guns N' Roses guitarist, presented the award. In 2010 Osbourne won the \"Literary Achievement\" honour for his memoir, I Am Ozzy, at the Guys Choice Awards at Sony Pictures Studio in Culver City, California. Osbourne was presented with the award by Ben Kingsley. The book debuted at No. 2 on the New York Times's hardcover non-fiction best-seller list. Osbourne was also a judge for the 6th, 10th and 11th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.

        "title": "Taylor Swift",
        "content": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is the highest-grossing live music artist, the wealthiest female musician, and one of the best-selling music artists of all time.\nSwift signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 and debuted as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. Speak Now (2010) expanded her country pop sound with rock influences, and Red (2012) featured a pop-friendly production. She recalibrated her artistic identity from country to pop with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014); ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). Through the 2010s, she accumulated the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\", and \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nAfter Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018, she released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019), the indie folk albums Folklore and Evermore (both 2020), the electropop record Midnights (2022), and the double album The Tortured Poets Department (2024). In the 2020s, she re-recorded four of her Big Machine albums due to a dispute with the label and garnered the US number-one singles \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". Her 2023–2024 concert tour, the Eras Tour, is the first to gross $1 billion in revenue. Its accompanying concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023), became the highest-grossing in history.\nSwift is the only artist to have been named the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year five times. A record seven of her albums have each sold over a million copies first-week in the US. Publications such as Rolling Stone and Billboard have ranked her among the greatest artists of all time. She is the first individual from the arts to be named Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards—including a record four Album of the Year wins—and a Primetime Emmy Award. She is the most-awarded artist of the American Music Awards, the Billboard Music Awards, and the MTV Video Music Awards. A subject of extensive media coverage, Swift has a global fanbase known as Swifties.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor; her parents chose a unisex name, hoping it would help her succeed in business. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor. The siblings are of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry. Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music.\nDuring childhood, Swift spent her holiday seasons on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania, and summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop. Raised Christian, she attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School in Pottstown. When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School. At age nine, she aspired to a career in musical theater, performing at local festivals and in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions, and traveling regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she changed her goal and became determined to pursue a country music career in Nashville, Tennessee.\nAt 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting. She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of a computer repairman and local musician who assisted Swift with writing an original song. In 2003, she and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and was given an artist development deal from RCA Records at 13. To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee. Swift attended Hendersonville High School for two years before transferring to Aaron Academy, which offered homeschooling.\n\n\n=== 2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album ===\n\nSwift signed to Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing in 2004; at 14, she became the youngest signee in the publishing company's history. In Nashville, she worked with experienced Music Row songwriters, including Liz Rose. Rose and Swift would write songs every Tuesday afternoon after school. After one year on the development deal, she left RCA Records, who decided to keep her in development until she turned 18. Swift made this decision because she wanted to release the songs immediately, to make sure that they still resonated with her teenage experiences.\nSwift organized a showcase concert at Bluebird Cafe on November 3, 2004; among the attendees were Scott Borchetta, a music executive who was planning to establish an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She signed a recording contract with Big Machine two weeks after the concert, on the condition that her albums would be written by herself; her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company. The contract was finalized by July 2005, when Swift ended the working relationship with Dymtrow. She spent four months near the end of 2005 recording her debut album, Taylor Swift, with the producer Nathan Chapman.\nSwift's debut single, \"Tim McGraw\", was released in June 2006. She and her mother spent mid-2006 sending promotional copies of the song to country radio stations across the US. Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006. On the US Billboard 200 chart, the album peaked at number five and spent 157 weeks—the longest chart run by an album in the 2000s. With Taylor Swift, she became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album. The album was promoted by a six-month radio tour and Swift's opening for other country artists, including Rascal Flatts in 2006, and George Strait, Brad Paisley, and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill in 2007. She opened for Rascal Flatts again in 2008, when she dated the singer Joe Jonas.\nTaylor Swift was supported by four more singles in 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reached number one on the Hot Country Songs chart; with the former single, Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one country single. \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts, reaching the top 10 of the Pop Songs, Adult Pop Songs, and Adult Contemporary charts. Her next releases were the Christmas extended play (EP) The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007, and the Walmart-exclusive EP Beautiful Eyes in July 2008. Swift became the youngest person to be awarded with Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007.\n\n\n=== 2008–2010: Fearless ===\n\nSwift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America, and in March 2009 in other markets. Fearless spent 11 weeks atop the Billboard 200, becoming her first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album; it was the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album's lead single, \"Love Story\", became the first country song to top the Pop Songs chart, and its third single, \"You Belong with Me\", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart; both reached the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked atop the Hot Country Songs chart. Three other singles—\"White Horse\", \"Fifteen\", \"Fearless\"—all reached the top 10 of Hot Country Songs. In 2009, Swift opened for Keith Urban's tour and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.\nFearless became the most-awarded country album of all time. It won the three highest awards for a country album: Album of the Year by both the Country Music Association Awards and Academy of Country Music Awards in 2009, and Best Country Album by the Grammy Awards in 2010. At the Grammys, it also won Album of the Year, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Also in 2009, Swift was named Artist of the Year by both the American Music Awards and Billboard, and Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association Awards, becoming the youngest person to win the honor. \"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards. Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became known as \"Kanyegate\" and turned into the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.\nSwift collaborated with other musicians in 2009. She featured on \"Half of My Heart\" by John Mayer, with whom she was romantically linked later that year. She wrote \"Best Days of Your Life\" for Kellie Pickler, co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One, and wrote and recorded \"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\" for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance. She had her acting debut in the 2010 rom-com Valentine's Day and wrote \"Today Was a Fairytale\" for its soundtrack. \"Today Was a Fairytale\" reached number one on the Canadian Hot 100. While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner. On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in a CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host to write their own opening monologue.\n\n\n=== 2010–2014: Speak Now and Red ===\n\nSwift wrote her third studio album, Speak Now, entirely by herself. Released on October 25, 2010, Speak Now expands on the country pop sound of Fearless and incorporates strong rock music influences. Speak Now debuted on the US Billboard 200 with over one million first-week copies sold, registering the highest single-week tally for a female country artist. Five of its singles—\"Mine\", \"Back to December\", \"Mean\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Ours\"—charted in the top three of Hot Country Songs; \"Sparks Fly\" and \"Ours\" reached number one. \"Mine\" peaked at number three and was the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100.\nSwift embarked on the Speak Now World Tour from February 2011 to March 2012. In 2011, Swift was honored as Woman of the Year by Billboard, Entertainer of the Year by both the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Country Music Association Awards, and Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards. She again won Entertainment of the Year by the Academy of Country Music Awards in 2012. At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, \"Mean\" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance. After Speak Now's release, Swift dated the actor Jake Gyllenhaal.\nOn October 22, 2012, Swift released her fourth studio album, Red, which featured collaborations with Chapman and new producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker. Conceived as a record that expanded beyond Swift's country pop releases, Red incorporates eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and dance-pop, leading to a critical debate over Swift's status as a country musician. The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales, becoming the fastest-selling country album in US history. It was Swift's first number-one album in the UK. During promotion of Red, Swift was romantically involved with the political heir Conor Kennedy, and subsequently the singer Harry Styles.\n\nThe two most successful singles from Red, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" and \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100. Both of them also reached the top five on the UK singles chart, and the former was Swift's first chart topper in the US. Two other singles, \"Begin Again\" and \"Red\", peaked in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100; while two others, \"Everything Has Changed\" and \"22\", reached the top 10 on the UK singles chart. The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and became the highest-grossing country tour with revenue of $150.2 million upon completion. Swift was named Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards in 2013.\nSwift wrote and recorded two songs for the soundtrack album to the 2012 dystopian film The Hunger Games: \"Eyes Open\" and \"Safe & Sound\". The latter, which was co-written with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media in 2013. She wrote and recorded \"Sweeter than Fiction\" for the soundtrack to the 2013 biographical film One Chance, and featured as a guest vocalist on B.o.B's 2012 single \"Both of Us\" and Tim McGraw's 2013 single \"Highway Don't Care\". Her acting roles included a voice acting role in the 2012 animated film The Lorax, a cameo in a 2013 episode of the sitcom New Girl, and a supporting role in the 2014 dystopian film The Giver.\n\n\n=== 2014–2018: 1989 and Reputation ===\nSwift relocated from Nashville to New York City in March 2014 and transformed her image from country to pop with her fifth studio album, 1989. She produced 1989 with Martin, Shellback, Chapman, and new collaborators Jack Antonoff, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami. Rooted in 1980s synth-pop, 1989 incorporates upbeat dance and electronic arrangements of synthesizers, drum machines, and processed vocals. Released on October 27, 2014, the album spent 11 weeks at number one and one year in the top 10 of the Billboard 200. It has sold 14 million copies worldwide, becoming Swift's best-selling album.\n\nThree of 1989's singles—\"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\"—reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100; the first two made Swift the first woman to replace herself at the top spot. Two other singles—\"Style\" and \"Wildest Dreams\"—peaked at numbers six and five, making 1989 the first album by Swift to have five consecutive top-10 singles on the Hot 100. The 1989 World Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2015 with $250 million in revenue. She was named Billboard's Woman of the Year and received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence at the American Music Awards in 2014, and \"Bad Blood\" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards in 2016, 1989 made Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice; it also won Best Pop Vocal Album, and \"Bad Blood\" won Best Music Video.\nDuring promotion of 1989, Swift publicly opposed free music streaming services. She published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in July 2014 to stress the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists, and, in November, removed her discography from ad-supported, free streaming platforms such as Spotify. Big Machine kept her music only on paid, subscription-required platforms. In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform, which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period. Big Machine returned Swift's catalog to Spotify and other free streaming platforms in June 2017.\nSwift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016. They co-wrote the EDM single \"This Is What You Came For\", which featured vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg. \"Better Man\", the 2016 single which Swift wrote for the country vocal group Little Big Town, won the Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year. She recorded \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to the 2017 film Fifty Shades Darker; the song became the highest-charting single from the Fifty Shades franchise on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two.\n\nIn April 2016, Kanye West released the single \"Famous\", in which he references Swift in the line, \"I made that bitch famous.\" Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval, and his then-wife, Kim Kardashian, released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. Although the clips were proven to be purposefully edited, the controversy made Swift a subject of an online \"cancel\" movement, where her critics denounced her as a fake and calculating \"snake\". In late 2016, after briefly dating the actor Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with the actor Joe Alwyn and underwent a hiatus.\nIn August 2017, Swift countersued and won a case against David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's seniors that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explores themes of fame, drama, and finding love amidst the tumultuous affairs. A primarily electropop album, its maximalist production experiments with urban styles of hip-hop and R&B. Released on November 10, 2017, Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales and also reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK.\nReputation's lead single, \"Look What You Made Me Do\", topped the Billboard Hot 100 with the highest sales and streaming week of 2017, and was Swift's first UK number-one single. The singles \"...Ready for It?\", \"End Game\", and \"Delicate\" were released to pop radio, all of which reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2018, Swift featured on Sugarland's \"Babe\", surpassed Whitney Houston as the most-awarded female musician at the American Music Awards, and embarked on the Reputation Stadium Tour, which grossed $345.7 million worldwide.\n\n\n=== 2018–2021: Lover, Folklore, and Evermore ===\nIn November 2018, Swift signed a record deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her albums under Republic Records' imprint. The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.\n\nSwift's first album with Republic Records and seventh overall, Lover, was released on August 23, 2019. She produced the album with Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little. Lover peaked atop the charts of such countries as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US, and was the global best-selling album by a solo artist of 2019. Three of its singles—\"Me!\", \"You Need to Calm Down\", and \"Lover\"—were released in 2019 and peaked in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. \"The Man\" was released in 2020 and reached the top 30, and \"Cruel Summer\" became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number one.\nIn 2019, Swift was honored as Artist of the Decade by the American Music Awards and Woman of the Decade by Billboard, and became the first female artist to win Video of the Year for a self-directed video with \"You Need to Calm Down\" at the MTV Video Music Awards. During promotion of Lover, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums under the label. Swift said that Big Machine would allow her to acquire the masters only if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign. In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which would enable her to control the licensing of her songs for commercial use.\nIn February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two \"sister albums\" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore on July 24, and Evermore on December 11. Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced several songs under the pseudonym William Bowery. Both albums incorporate muted, atmospheric indie folk and indie rock sounds with orchestrations; each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore. Folklore and \"Cardigan\" made Swift the first artist to debut a number-one album and a number-one song in the same week in the US; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and \"Willow\".\nSwift won Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards in 2020 and Album of the Year for Folklore at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021, becoming the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times. She played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\". The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and received positive reviews.\n\n\n=== 2021–2023: Re-recordings and Midnights ===\nSwift released two re-recorded albums in 2021: Fearless (Taylor's Version) in April and Red (Taylor's Version) in November. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so. The latter helped Swift surpass Shania Twain as the female musician with the most weeks at number one on the Top Country Albums chart. The song \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" from Red (Taylor's Version) became the longest song in history to top the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nSwift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released on October 21, 2022. The album features a minimalist electropop and synth-pop sound, with elements of hip-hop, R&B, and electronica. Midnights was Swift's fifth album to open atop the Billboard 200 chart with US first-week sales of one million. Its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", made her the first artist to occupy the entire top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 the same week. The album peaked atop the charts of at least 14 other countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Sweden. Two other singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.\nIn 2023, Swift released two re-recorded albums: Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand, and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million US first-week copies. The single \"Is It Over Now?\" from 1989 (Taylor's Version) peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Swift featured on Big Red Machine's \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" (2021), Haim's \"Gasoline\" (2021), Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\" (2022), and the National's \"The Alcott\" (2023). She wrote and recorded \"Carolina\" for the soundtrack of the 2022 mystery film Where the Crawdads Sing, and had a supporting role in the 2022 period comedy film Amsterdam.\nIn 2022, Swift won Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards and Video of the Year for All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" at the MTV Video Music Awards; All Too Well also won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video. The following year, she again won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year with \"Anti-Hero\", became the first musician to rank at number one on Billboard's year-end top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023), and had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of the year in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991. At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in 2024, Midnights made Swift the first artist to win Album of the Year four times; it also won Best Pop Vocal Album.\n\n\n=== 2023–present: The Eras Tour, The Tortured Poets Department, and The Life of a Showgirl ===\n\nIn March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, which she conceived as a tribute to her entire discography. The tour spanned five continents through December 2024. It exerted a global cultural, economic, and political impact and culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity for Swift, resulting in a phenomenon that the media dubbed \"Swiftmania\". The Eras Tour became the first tour to gross $1 billion in revenue and the highest-grossing tour in history, with $2 billion in total revenue. Its concert film grossed $250 million to become the highest-grossing of its kind, and its photobook sold nearly a million copies in its first week in the US. The tour inspired Swift's eleventh and twelfth studio albums, The Tortured Poets Department (2024) and The Life of a Showgirl (2025).\nDuring the run of the Eras Tour, there were controversies surrounding Ticketmaster's monopoly that led to political scrutiny in the US, venue mismanagement that led to a death in Brazil, and Singapore's exclusivity deal that led to political tension in Southeast Asia. In January 2024, AI-generated pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform. In July 2024, three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK. The following month, the Vienna concerts were canceled following the arrest of suspects who planned a terrorist attack.\nThe Tortured Poets Department was released on April 19, 2024. It became the first album to accumulate one billion streams on Spotify within one week and topped charts of various countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the UK. In the US, The Tortured Poets Department debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 2.6 million first-week units and stayed at number one for 17 weeks, becoming Swift's longest-running number-one album. The album was the global best-seller of 2024, with 5.6 million pure copies sold. Its songs, led by the single \"Fortnight\", made her the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 the same week; the second single, \"I Can Do It with a Broken Heart\", peaked at number three. On May 30, 2025, Swift finalized the purchase of the masters to her first six original studio albums from Shamrock Holdings, which had acquired them from Braun in 2020.\nSwift began dating football player Travis Kelce in 2023, with the media dubbing them a \"supercouple\". They became engaged in August 2025. She revealed The Life of a Showgirl on his podcast New Heights that month, and it is scheduled for release on October 3, 2025.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Musical styles ===\nWith continuous musical reinventions, Swift was described as a musical \"chameleon\" by publications such as Time and the BBC. Her discography spans styles of pop, country, folk, and rock, with elements of R&B, hip-hop, and indie pop. She self-identified as a country musician with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red. Her influences were female country artists of the 1990s such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, the Dixie Chicks, and Keith Urban's country crossover sound with elements of rock, pop, and blues. The albums feature a country pop sound defined by instruments such as six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, a slight twang in Swift's vocals, and pop-rock melodies; Speak Now draws on rock styles of the 1970s and 1980s such as pop rock, pop-punk, and arena rock. Some critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's songwriting rather than musical style and accused her of causing mainstream country to stray away from its roots.\nAfter the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna. 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines. Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums. Reputation consists of hip-hop, R&B, and EDM influences; maximalist arrangements of heavy bass and manipulated vocals; and an emphasis on rhythm. Lover incorporates eclectic sounds from country, pop-punk, and folk rock. Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both have a minimalist synth-pop sound characterized by analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns. When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded it as an erosion of her country songwriting authenticity, but others considered it necessary for her artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.\nHer 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, described by some critics as \"alternative\", explore indie folk and rock styles. They incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestrations, muted synthesizers, and drum pads. Evermore experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments. Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's singer-songwriter status and credited her with popularizing \"alternative\" music, although there were disagreements on this description.\n\n\n=== Voice ===\n\nSwift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, but she mostly sings in her alto range. Reviews of her early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers. Defenders of Swift appreciated that she refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized intimacy and emotionality to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience—a style that critics have described as conversational. According to the critic Ann Powers, this singing style is demonstrated through Swift's attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the subtle adjustment of words and phrases to suggest moods like doubt, hope, and intimacy\".\nOn Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are processed with electronic effects such as synthesizer tweaking, looping, and multitracking, to accompany the pop production. Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody. She uses her lower register vocals extensively in Folklore and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and the lower register as \"full and dark\".\nReception of Swift's vocals has been more positive since the release of Folklore. The critic Amanda Petrusich commented in 2023 that her singing became richer with stronger clarity and tone, even in live performances. Rolling Stone ranked her 102nd on their 2023 list \"200 Greatest Singers of All Time\"; the magazine argued that her breathy timbre allows for a broad range of delivery and commented: \"A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument.\" For Powers, Swift's versatile vocals are a result of her evolving artistry, combining \"subtle interpolations of hip-hop's cadences and country crooners' relaxed timbre\".\n\n\n=== Songwriting ===\nSwift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood; she credited her mother with igniting early interests by helping her prepare for class presentations, and would make up lyrics to Disney soundtrack songs once she had run out of words singing them. In her early career, her influences were the country musicians Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton; and the 1990s female singer-songwriters Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette. In later interviews, she listed Joni Mitchell and Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy as additional influences; and Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models for their evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.\nSwift considers herself a songwriter first and foremost. She divides her lyrics into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous. Using songwriting to cope with personal experiences, her songs are largely autobiographical and feature narratives that mostly revolve around love and romantic relationships. She would start writing by identifying an emotion she wanted to convey, and the story and melody would follow. Where Taylor Swift and Fearless are rooted in adolescent feelings and detail optimistic romance inspired by fairy tales, Speak Now reflects her young adulthood with newfound wisdom on real-life heartbreak. Red explores the tumult of an intense breakup, and 1989 reflects on failed relationships with a wistful perspective; both albums incorporate lyrics that hint at sex, reflecting her personal growth. Swift described Lover as a \"love letter to love\", inspired by her realization of \"love that was very real\".\nAs her career progressed, Swift wrote about self-perception and confrontation against her critics, influenced by fame, sexism, and scrutiny on her personal life by the press. This was first exhibited in Speak Now, which set the precedent for the frantic media speculations on the subjects of Swift's songs, specifically concerning her dating history; Swift considers this practice sexist. Reputation both tackles the public controversies that tarnished her wholesome image and addresses a blossoming romance with intimacy and vulnerability; its extensive references to sex and alcohol set it apart from the youthful innocence that had informed Swift's past albums. The nocturnal ruminations addressed in Midnights encompass regrets and fantasies, informed by Swift's self-awareness of her fame. The Tortured Poets Department was conceived amidst her heightened fame brought by the Eras Tour and intensely publicized love life during 2023. It explores heartbreak and other themes to extremes: erotic desires, forbidden love, and escaping from the public spotlight.\nOn Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives, deviating from the autobiographical songwriting that had characterized her artistry. She imposed her emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, inspired by authors and poets of romantic and modernist literature like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert Frost, William Wordsworth, and Emily Dickinson; the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift. The characters of Folklore and Evermore construct their narratives based on fragments of memory, symbolizing the nature of folktales and oral traditions that pass through time.\nSwift considers her songwriting \"confessional\", and academics have connected her style to that of confessional poetry, in that her songs reference personal events and publicize internal feelings to her audience. Critical reception of her songwriting has been largely positive, and her melodic compositions have been highlighted for optimizing the verse-chorus form with memorable bridges. Several scholars have credited her with taking the confessional singer-songwriter tradition to new heights, and she has been variedly described by journalists as a \"poet laureate\"—of puberty, of romance, and of her generation. Some critics have dismissed her \"confessional\" style as material for tabloid gossip. Objection to the perceived poetic value of her songs, mostly from rockist critics, views her as a pop star using literary subtexts as a commercial ploy, with metaphors that are at times imprecise or self-indulgent.\nScholars have attributed criticisms of Swift's songwriting to sexism. The musicologist Travis Stimeling argued that whereas Swift's autobiographical authenticity conforms to country and rock standards, her detractors, mostly male, view her lyrical depictions of a young woman's experiences as trivial and unworthy of serious merit. According to the English-language academic Ryan Hibbett, this gendered criticism bars Swift from receiving full artistic credentials as does Bob Dylan, whose reliance on romantic themes and occasional literary imprecisions are not as harshly criticized. In the view of the literary critic Stephanie Burt, although Swift's writing is not poetry in its traditional sense, it is proficient at \"placing inventive, evocative language into pop melodies designed to be sung\".\n\n\n=== Performances and stage ===\n\nSwift's concerts are equipped with elaborate settings, incorporating elements from Broadway theatre and high tech. She does not rely on elaborate choreography and instead emphasizes connecting emotionally with her audience through storytelling and vocal delivery. Since 2007, she has toured with the same live band. She plays four instruments live: guitar (including electric, acoustic six-string, and twelve-string), six-string banjo, piano, and ukulele.\nCritics have praised her stage presence, stamina, and ability to bring forth an intimate atmosphere for her audience, even in stadium settings. Sasha Frere-Jones, in a 2008 article for The New Yorker, hailed her as a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer who exerted professionalism with a vibrant energy. In Time's 2023 Person of the Year piece, Sam Lansky wrote: \"Swift is many things onstage—vulnerable and triumphant, playful and sad—but the intimacy of her songcraft is front and center.\"\n\n\n=== Videos and filmmaking ===\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music. She established her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, in 2008. Her directorial debut was the music video for \"Mine\", co-directed with Roman White, in 2010; and she developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011. For the music videos of the 1989 and Reputation singles, she had an extensive collaboration with the director Joseph Kahn on eight videos; among them, she produced \"Bad Blood\", which won Best Music Video at the Grammy Awards in 2016. She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.\nAs of May 2025, Swift has directed 13 of her music videos. Her first solo directorial role was for \"The Man\", which made her the first female artist to win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction. All Too Well: The Short Film marked her filmmaking debut, and it made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a solo director. In June 2023, Swift was invited to the Academy of Motion Pictures. She has cited Joseph Kahn, Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.\n\n\n== Achievements ==\n\nSwift has won 14 Grammy Awards (including four Album of the Year wins—the most by an artist), 12 Country Music Association Awards, 8 Academy of Country Music Awards, 2 Brit Awards, and an Emmy Award. She is the most-awarded artist of the American Music Awards (40 wins), Billboard Music Awards (49), and MTV Video Music Awards (30, tied with Beyoncé). Swift is the first woman and second artist overall (after Garth Brooks) to be honored with the Pinnacle Award by the Country Music Association Awards, in 2013, and the first woman to receive the Global Icon Award by the Brit Awards, in 2021. At the 64th BMI Pop Awards in 2016, Swift became the first female songwriter to be honored with an award named after its recipient, the Taylor Swift Award. She is the youngest person to be featured on Rolling Stone's 2015 list \"The 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\", received the Songwriter Icon Award from the National Music Publishers' Association in 2021, and was named the Songwriter-Artist of the Decade by the Nashville Songwriters Association International in 2022.\nThe International Federation of the Phonographic Industry honored her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year five times (2014, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024), more than any other artist. She is the most-streamed artist on Spotify as of February 2024, and the highest-grossing touring act of all time, with cumulative revenue at $3.12 billion as of December 2024. Her chart records include the most number-one albums in the UK and Ireland for a female artist in the 21st century; the first artist to occupy the top five of the Australian albums chart, doing so twice, and the top 10 of the Australian singles chart; the most entries, most simultaneous entries, and most number-one entries for a soloist on the Billboard Global 200; and the first artist to spend 100 weeks atop the Billboard Artist 100.\nIn the US, Swift has sold 116.7 million album units, including 54 million pure sales, as of May 2025. She is the solo artist with the most weeks at number one on the Billboard 200; the female artist with the most number-one albums on the Billboard 200 (14) and most number-one debuts on the Billboard Hot 100 (7, tied with Ariana Grande); the artist with the most number-one songs on Pop Airplay; the first artist to chart five albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200; and the first woman to have both an album (Fearless) and a song (\"Shake It Off\") receive Diamond certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Billboard ranked her at number eight on its list \"Greatest of All Time Artists\" (2019), number two on \"Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century\" (2024), and number one on \"Top 100 Women Artists of the 21st Century\" and \"Top Artists of the 21st Century\" (both 2025).\nSwift has appeared in power listings. In 2024, she became the first solo artist, and second overall (after Beyoncé and Jay-Z), to top Billboard's annual Power 100 ranking of the top music industry executives. Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019. She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault. In 2023, she became the first person to be recognized as Time's Person of the Year for \"achievement in the arts\" and the first woman to appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once. She received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.\n\n\n== Public image ==\n\nSwift is an enduring figure of 21st-century popular culture. Her career trajectory from a country singer-songwriter to a pop star in the 2000s and 2010s was the subject of extensive commentary. Deemed \"America's Sweetheart\" in her early career, she was described in the press as a \"media darling\" with a girl next door's polite demeanor and open-hearted conversations. Swift displayed a feminine image but refrained from the \"aggressively sexualized feminist pop\" of her contemporaries, leading publications to comment that her sex appeal was modest, subtle, and sophisticated. The adolescent themes of Swift's music contributed to her status as a teen idol, although several feminist authors took issue with her songs about romantic relationships as narrow-minded and detrimental to girls and women, who made up the majority of her fanbase known as Swifties.\nUpon recalibrating her artistry to pop music, Swift has identified as a feminist and achieved a pop icon status. In 2013, the author Jody Rosen labelled Swift the \"Queen of Pop\", citing her popularity that defied traditional boundaries between \"genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\". Her feminist public image garnered varying reactions from the public, including praise that regarded her success in a male-dominated music industry as an inspiration for girls and women, and criticism that dismissed her feminist adoption as superficial and self-interested.\nThe 2016 dispute with Kanye West bolstered the narrative by her detractors that she was a calculating and manipulative woman despite her sweetheart image, and deepened their feud that has resonated in their respective careers. Her artistic reinventions in the 2020s turned her into an acclaimed singer-songwriter. Buoyed by her enduring pop stardom, she has been recognized as a rare phenomenon that combines the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes with unprecedented success.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nSwift is one of the few artists who consistently sells millions of albums throughout two decades of artistic reinventions despite the industry decline of record sales after the album era had ended. In this regard, academics and journalists have described her as \"the last pop superstar\" and \"the last great rock star\" of the 21st century. Her commercial strategies to bolster sales of albums and concert tickets have earned her a reputation as a savvy businesswoman. The economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\". Strategies such as enhanced material for physical album variants and easter egg usage in her works became indicative of music marketing trends.\nSwift's success in country music has been credited with popularizing country beyond the US and introducing the genre to adolescent women, a previously ignored demographic. The critic Kelefa Sanneh dubbed Swift the biggest country star since Garth Brooks, \"and maybe since before him, too\". Her guitar performances resulted in increasing sales of guitars to women, which the media dubbed the \"Taylor Swift factor\". Her transition from country to pop has been credited as the catalyst for poptimism, and her songwriting and musical transitions have been credited with influencing a new generation of artists. According to Billboard, Swift is one of the few artists who could achieve chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support at the same time, and she has the ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.\nSwift's enduring popularity, particularly to female audiences, contributed to her status as a representation of millennials, or more broadly, her generation's zeitgeist. Her fandom of Swifties has been described by journalists and academics as one of the most loyal and dedicated. In the views of Time's Cady Lang, she maintained her superstardom by her \"savvy manipulation of both the industry and [her] personal brand\". According to the popular-culture scholars Mary Fogarty and Gina Arnold, Swift is arguably the singular artist \"whose story encapsulates many of the urgent conflicts in early twenty-first-century American culture\". In a 2024 article for The New York Times, Joe Coscarelli wrote that her lasting popularity provoked debates that compared her not only to contemporaries like Drake or Beyoncé, but also to veteran artists like the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Elton John, or Madonna.\nSwift's advocacy for artists' rights and re-recording projects have contributed to industry-wide discourses and reforms. Her artistry and career maneuvers have been the subject of various university courses in literary, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts. According to the popular culture scholars Sarai Brinker, Kate Galloway, and Elizabeth Scala, Swift's legacy has been both embraced and critiqued by different affiliations—feminist and queer communities, far-right groups, and religious organizations, and studied by experts in various fields—musicology, literature, sociology, media theory, linguistics, and culture studies.\n\n\n== Wealth and other activities ==\nSwift was listed by Forbes as the world's highest-paid musician in 2016 and 2019, the highest-paid female musician of the 2010s decade, and the highest-paid female musician of 2021 and 2022. By October 2023, as reported by both Forbes and Bloomberg L.P., Swift achieved her billionaire status. She was recognized as the first billionaire \"primarily based on her songs and performances\", with the majority of her fortune coming from royalties and touring. As of June 2025, her estimated net worth by Forbes stands at $1.6 billion, making her the richest female musician in the world. Her real estate portfolio, estimated by Forbes at $110 million as of 2025, consists of residential properties in Nashville, New York City, Los Angeles (Samuel Goldwyn Estate), and Rhode Island (High Watch).\nSwift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions. In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights. In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to the American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks. Media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data. In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.\n\n\n=== Endorsements and partnerships ===\n\nSwift's album rollouts normally consist of multimedia promotional activities that encompass corporate tie-ins and product endorsements. Target is a long-standing business partner with Swift, offering exclusive physical albums and merchandise. In 2008–2011, her albums and tours were promoted with self-designed dolls with Jakks Pacific, fragrances with Elizabeth Arden, clothes with L.E.I., and holiday cards with American Greetings. Her partnership deals included makeup products for CoverGirl and Cyber-shot cameras for Sony Electronics. In 2012–2015, she had tie-ins with Starbucks, Keds, Subway, Diet Coke, Walgreens, Walmart, and Papa John's.\nIn 2014, New York City named Swift its official tourism ambassador. She had an exclusive streaming deal with Apple Music in 2015, signed a multi-year deal with AT&T in 2016, and partnered with United Parcel Service to distribute her albums in 2017. In 2019, she signed a multi-year deal with Capital One and launched a clothing line with Stella McCartney. She became the first global ambassador for Record Store Day in 2022.\n\n\n=== Social activism ===\n\nSwift avoided discussing politics in her early career. In an interview with Time in 2012, she said that she kept herself as educated as possible but did not want to influence other people with her political opinions. Due to her apolitical stance, she was appropriated by the alt-right movement in the US, which sparked controversy. She did express support for President Barack Obama in 2008: \"I've never seen this country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive.\"\nSince 2018, Swift has been public about her political views and abandoned her once apolitical stance. She publicly endorsed two Democratic politicians for the 2018 US midterm election, which resulted in headlines about how she finally dissociated herself from the alt-right and conservatives. In interviews, she attributed her political reluctance in the past to the 2003 Dixie Chicks controversy, which left a lasting impact on country musicians at large and female country musicians in particular. She has openly criticized President Donald Trump. In 2020, Swift urged her fans to check their voter registration ahead of elections, which resulted in 65,000 people registering to vote within one day of her post, and endorsed the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the 2020 US presidential election. For the 2024 election, she once again endorsed the Democratic ticket of Harris and Tim Walz.\nA pro-choice feminist, Swift is a founding signatory of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment, and she criticized the US Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022. A supporter of LGBTQ rights, she has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD. In 2019, she called the passing of the Equality Act and performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument. Swift has spoken up against white supremacy, racism, and police brutality in the US. She has supported the March for Our Lives movement and gun control reform in the US, donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Black Lives Matter movement, called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee, and advocated for Juneteenth to become a national holiday.\nSwift's political engagements have been met with mixed reception: they have provoked further public discussions on political issues and empowered Swifties, but critics have questioned whether her political alignments were strategic in her career. While some publications have argued that Swift's stardom had a significant impact on political involvements in the US, others have viewed her influence as sizable but overstated. According to the popular-culture scholar Simone Driessen, her political impact reached beyond the US to Australia and Europe.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nSwift ranked first on DoSomething's 2015 \"Gone Good\" list, having received the Star of Compassion from the Tennessee Disaster Services and the Big Help Award from the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for her \"dedication to helping others\" and \"inspiring others through action\". Especially early in her career, Swift donated to various relief funds following natural disasters. In 2009, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood of 2008. The same year, she performed at Sydney's Sound Relief concert, which raised money for those impacted by bushfires and flooding. In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the US, raising more than $750,000. In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, she donated $500,000. In 2009, Swift sang at the BBC's Children in Need concert and raised £13,000 for the cause. In 2016, she donated $1 million to Louisiana flood relief efforts and $100,000 to the Dolly Parton Fire Fund. Swift donated to food banks after Hurricane Harvey struck Houston in 2017. Swift donated $1 million for Tennessee tornado relief in 2020 and again in 2023, as well as $5 million toward the relief efforts after Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton in 2024.\nSwift has also donated to cancer research. As the recipient of the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year in 2011, Swift donated $25,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee. In 2012, she participated in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon, performing the charity single \"Ronan\", which she wrote in memory of a four-year-old boy who died of neuroblastoma. She has also donated $100,000 to the V Foundation for Cancer Research and $50,000 to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She has made donations to her fans several times for their medical or academic expenses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift donated to the World Health Organization and Feeding America and supported independent record stores. Swift performed \"Soon You'll Get Better\" on the One World: Together At Home television special, a benefit concert curated by Lady Gaga for Global Citizen to raise funds for the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.\nShe is a supporter of the arts. A benefactor of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, Swift has donated $75,000 to Hendersonville High School to help refurbish the school auditorium, $4 million to build a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, and $100,000 to the Nashville Symphony. In 2012, Swift partnered with Chegg for Good to donate $10,000 to the music departments of six US colleges.\nShe has also provided one-off donations. In 2007, she partnered with the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police to launch a campaign to protect children from online predators. She has donated items to several charities for auction, including the UNICEF Tap Project and MusiCares. Swift has also encouraged young people to volunteer in their local communities as part of Global Youth Service Day. Also a promoter of children's literacy, she has donated money and books to schools around the country. In 2018 and 2021, Swift donated to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network in honor of Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. Swift donated to fellow singer-songwriter Kesha to help with her legal battles against Dr. Luke and to actress Mariska Hargitay's Joyful Heart Foundation.\nDuring the Eras Tour, Swift donated to food banks in Florida, Arizona, and Las Vegas; she also employed local businesses throughout the tour and gave $197 million in bonus payments to her entire crew. In February 2024, she donated $100,000 to the family of a woman who died in a shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl parade. In December 2024, a week before Christmas, Swift donated $250,000 to Operation Breakthrough. The funds were directed to workforce development, childcare, and early learning programs.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\nFearless Tour (2009–2010)\nSpeak Now World Tour (2011–2012)\nThe Red Tour (2013–2014)\nThe 1989 World Tour (2015)\nReputation Stadium Tour (2018)\nThe Eras Tour (2023–2024)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of American Grammy Award winners and nominees\nList of highest-certified music artists in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Cited literature ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nTaylor Swift at AllMusic \nTaylor Swift discography at Discogs \nTaylor Swift at IMDb \nTaylor Swift discography at MusicBrainz",

        "title": "The Summer I Turned Pretty (TV series)",
        "content": "The Summer I Turned Pretty is an American coming-of-age romantic drama television series created by author Jenny Han for Amazon Prime Video, and it is based on her novel trilogy of the same name. Lola Tung stars as Belly Conklin, a teenager involved in a love triangle with brothers Conrad and Jeremiah, played by Christopher Briney and Gavin Casalegno, respectively.\nProduction on the series began in 2021. It premiered on June 17, 2022, with the first season consisting of seven episodes. Before its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season, which debuted on July 14, 2023, and includes eight episodes. In August 2023, the series was renewed for a third season.

The series is based on the 2009 novel of the same name by Jenny Han. It is created by Han who also serves as the showrunner and an executive producer. Also executive producing are Gabrielle Stanton, Karen Rosenfelt, Nne Ebong, and Hope Hartman. Stanton is also a co-showrunner for the first season. On June 8, 2022, ahead of the series premiere, Amazon renewed the series for a second season, with Han and Sarah Kucserka as co-showrunners. On August 3, 2023, ahead of the second season finale, the series was renewed for a third season, with Han and Kucserka returning as showrunners.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nOn April 28, 2021, Lola Tung, Rachel Blanchard, Jackie Chung, and Christopher Briney were cast as series regulars. In July 2021, Gavin Casalegno, Sean Kaufman, Minnie Mills, and Alfredo Narciso joined the main cast, while Summer Madison, David Iacono, Rain Spencer, and Tom Everett Scott joined the cast in recurring roles. On August 31, 2022, Kyra Sedgwick and Elsie Fisher were cast in recurring capacities for the second season. On April 20, 2023, Mills announced that she had exited the series ahead of the second season. On June 4, 2025, it was reported that Isabella Briggs and Kristen Connolly were cast as new series regulars while Sofia Bryant, Lily Donoghue, Zoé de Grand'Maison, Emma Ishta, and Tanner Zagarino in recurring capacities for the third season.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography for the first season took place in 2021 in Wilmington, North Carolina, locations included Carolina Beach, Fort Fisher, and Wave Transit's Padgett Station on N. 3rd Street. Filming of the second season began in July 2022 and concluded in November 2022.\nCast members have confirmed that filming for the third season was initially set to begin in 2023. However, it ended up being delayed due to the Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes which happened from May to November 2023. In late January 2024, it was confirmed that the third season had entered into pre-production in the Wilmington area, eyeing a spring start date. On May 14, 2024, it was announced that the third season had begun filming.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe series features an original score by Zachary Dawes, released as an Amazon Original soundtrack album for season 1. Pop needle drops recur throughout the show, with Taylor Swift the most prominently featured artist across seasons. Swift’s re-recording of \"This Love (Taylor's Version)\" debuted in the first teaser trailer released by Prime Video in May 2022, and the full track was issued the next day. In season 1, placements include \"Cruel Summer,\" \"Lover,\" and \"False God,\" and the finale’s debutante ball dance uses \"The Way I Loved You (Taylor’s Version).\"\nSeason 2 continues this approach with placements such as \"Last Kiss (Taylor’s Version),\" \"Invisible String,\" \"Sweet Nothing,\" \"Snow on the Beach,\" \"Bigger Than the Whole Sky,\" and \"Exile.\" \nIn season 3, Swift’s \"You’re Losing Me\" closes the premiere, \"False God\" returns in episode 6, and \"cardigan\" is used in episode 8. The official trailer for the final season features \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" and \"Daylight.\" Showrunner Jenny Han has also said she wrote a handwritten note to Swift to help secure \"The Way I Loved You (Taylor’s Version)\" and other permissions.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe series premiered on Prime Video on June 17, 2022. The first three episodes of the second season premiered on July 14, 2023, with the remaining five episodes released weekly until the finale on August 18, 2023. Before the release of the third and final season, Prime Video uploaded the first and second seasons of the show for free on YouTube. The 11-episode third and final season premiered on July 16, 2025, with two new episodes, and followed by a new episode on a weekly basis until the series finale on September 17, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\n\n==== Season 1 ====\nFor the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 88% approval rating with an average rating of 7.1/10, based on 24 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The Summer I Turned Pretty doesn't need more time to become a swan, coming out of the gate a solidly charming and sweet rom-com with appeal across generations.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 72 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nAngie Han of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"As a coming-of-age story, Amazon's The Summer I Turned Pretty is a cut above. Tenderly written and endearingly acted, it's sensitive to the subtle but irreversible shifts in self-perception that come with late adolescence—and at the same time clear-eyed enough to understand that teenagers, up to and including its own blushing heroine, sure can act like clueless jerks while they're figuring out how to wield their newfound powers.\" Delia Cai of Vanity Fair also gave a positive review, commenting that \"the specificity of Laurel's fantasy summer is ultimately what rescues The Summer I Turned Pretty from being too sticky sweet.\"\nWriting for The Playlist, Marya E. Gates wrote, \"Although the voiceover in which [Belly] shares [her] feelings is unevenly deployed, it's refreshing to see a story that puts the girl in the driver's seat and gives her the room to work through the contradictions of adolescence and sexual coming-of-age on her own terms.\" Joyce Slaton of Common Sense Media said the series is \"as sweet, light, and refreshing as a soda on ice by the swimming pool...[and] tackles the confusion and loveliness of an awkward coming-of-age.\"\nAbby Cavenaugh of Collider noted \"though at some points, the love triangle—or quadrangle, with Cam included—can feel a bit forced, overall this story works on many levels. You grow to really care about these characters and want to see them happy,\" adding \"Belly is the star of the show, and Tung sells every moment of it with her luminous performance.\"\n\n\n==== Season 2 ====\nThe second season holds an approval rating of 62% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 13 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. On Metacritic, the second season received a score of 71 based on reviews from 6 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nSome critics welcomed the series' tackling of the heavier themes of grief and loss. Lauren Chval of The A.V. Club said that season 2 raises the stakes of the central love triangle and makes a strong case for a Jeremiah relationship with Belly. Tung's performance received continued praise, with Kayleigh Donaldson of TheWrap writing that \"the season is at its best when it focuses on Belly, giving space to her emotional strife and the oft-derided difficulties of being a teenage girl in a world where you're positioned as something between a sex object and a punching bag.\" The soundtrack also received praise.\nOthers felt the second season lacks the breeziness and fun of the first season. Though critics noted the narrative stays faithful to the book, some said the integration of flashback scenes was at times confusing and that important storylines were being skipped. Writing for Collider, Therese Lacson gave an overall positive review but noted that the season's addition of new characters meant less time to develop their arcs and the meat of their stories. Nicole Gallucci of Decider wrote season 2's \"emotional roller coaster serves as a harsh reminder that life isn't always a beach, but its unique mix of 'miserable and magical' will keep you hooked until the end.\"\n\n\n==== Season 3 ====\nThe third season has an approval rating of 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 5 critic reviews.\n\n\n=== Impact ===\nAfter the series' debut, all three The Summer I Turned Pretty books entered the top three spots on the Amazon Best Sellers list, with the second book, It's Not Summer Without You, reaching number one. The artists whose music is used in the show have also seen an increase in streams, sales and followers, with some experiencing up to a 6,000% increase in song sales. Taylor Swift's seventh studio album, Lover, resurged in sales and streaming, and re-entered the top 40 region of the Billboard 200 chart as well, after three of its songs—\"Cruel Summer\", \"Lover\" and \"False God\"—were featured in the series. Beyoncé's 2014 single \"XO\" tripled in sales units following the use of it in the finale. The series also had a significant social media reach, with the hashtag #TheSummerITurnedPretty accumulating over 13.8 billion views on TikTok. It generated over 107,000 global posts over launch weekend and 725 million potential impressions across platforms, according to social analytics agency DMS.\n\n\n=== Audience viewership ===\nIn September 2023, Vernon Sanders, an Amazon Prime executive, revealed that season 2 of Jenny Han's YA adaptation was the streamer's No. 2 most-viewed series to date among women 18–34, behind only Rings of Power, according to Prime Video. It was also the most-completed series to-date among that demographic. The series had also driven subscription growth that summer, Amazon reported. The Summer I Turned Pretty was among Prime Video's Top 3 series in terms of global acquisition (and, again, No. 1 with women 18-34). On July 28, 2025, it reported that the third and final season drew 25 million viewers globally within its first seven days of the season premiere.\n\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nThe Summer I Turned Pretty at IMDb",

        "title": "Amanda Knox",
        "content": "Amanda Marie Knox (born July 9, 1987) is an American woman who was accused of the murder of Meredith Kercher in 2007 in Perugia, Italy. She served almost four years of a 26-year sentence before the murder conviction was overturned, and she was finally acquitted of murder by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation in 2015. In 2024, an Italian appellate court upheld Knox's calunnia conviction for falsely accusing Patrick Lumumba of murdering Kercher, for which she had been sentenced to and served three years in prison. After her release, Knox has written books and appeared in documentaries and other media about her case.\nKnox, aged 20 at the time of the murder, called the police after returning to her and Kercher's apartment after a night spent with her boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, and finding Kercher's bedroom door locked and blood in the bathroom. During the police interrogations that followed, the conduct of which is a matter of dispute, Knox allegedly implicated herself and her employer, Lumumba, in the murder. Initially, Knox, Sollecito, and Lumumba were all arrested for Kercher's murder, but Lumumba was soon released because he had a strong alibi. \nA known burglar, Rudy Guede, was soon arrested, after his bloody fingerprints were found on Kercher's possessions. He was convicted of murder in a fast-track trial and was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment, later reduced to 16 years. In December 2020, an Italian court ruled that Guede could complete his term by doing community service.\nIn their initial trial in 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison, respectively. Pre-trial publicity in Italian media, which was repeated by other media worldwide, portrayed Knox in a negative light and gave her the nickname \"Foxy Knoxy\", leading to complaints that the prosecution was using character assassination. A guilty verdict at Knox's initial trial and her 26-year sentence caused international controversy, because American forensic experts thought evidence at the crime scene was incompatible with her involvement. \nA prolonged legal process, including a successful prosecution appeal against her acquittal at a second-level trial, continued after Knox was freed in 2011. On March 27, 2015, Italy's highest court definitively exonerated Knox and Sollecito. However, Knox's conviction for committing defamation against Lumumba was upheld by all courts. On January 14, 2016, Knox was acquitted of defamation for saying she had been struck by policewomen during the interrogation.\nKnox later became an autobiographical author and activist, producing memoirs and commentary related to her case that presented her account of the events. Her first book Waiting to Be Heard: A Memoir was released in 2013. In 2018, she began hosting The Scarlet Letter Reports, a television series, which examined the \"gendered nature of public shaming\". Her second memoir, Free: My Search for Meaning, was published in 2025.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAmanda Knox was born July 9, 1987, in Seattle, Washington, the eldest of three daughters born to Edda Mellas, a mathematics teacher originally from Germany, and Curt Knox, a vice president of finance for Macy's. Knox and her sisters were raised in West Seattle. Her parents were divorced when she was 10 years old; her mother then married Chris Mellas, an information-technology consultant.\nKnox first traveled to Italy at age 15, on a family holiday. During that trip, she visited Rome, Pisa, the Amalfi Coast, and the ruins of Pompeii. Upon reading Under the Tuscan Sun, which was given to her by her mother, she grew more interested in the country.\nKnox graduated from the Seattle Preparatory School in 2005 and then studied linguistics at the University of Washington. In 2007, she made the dean's list at the university. She worked at part-time jobs to fund an academic year in Italy. Relatives described the 20-year-old Knox as outgoing but unwary. Her stepfather had strong reservations about her going to Italy that year, because he found her too naïve.\n\n\n== Italy ==\n\n\n=== Via della Pergola 7 ===\nKnox had come to Perugia for its universities and because it had fewer tourists than Florence, a more popular destination for foreign students. Knox lived in a four-bedroom, ground-floor apartment at Via della Pergola 7 with three other women. Her flatmates were Meredith Kercher (a British exchange student) and two Italian trainee lawyers in their late twenties, one of whom was Filomena Romanelli. Kercher and Knox moved in on September 10 and 20, 2007, respectively, meeting each other for the first time. Knox was employed part-time at a bar, Le Chic, which was owned by a Congolese-French man, Diya Patrick Lumumba. Kercher's English female friends saw relatively little of Knox, who preferred to socialize with Italians.\nGiacomo Silenzi, who lived in a walk-out semi-basement apartment of the building, shared an interest in music with Kercher and Knox and often visited their apartment. Returning home at 2 a.m. one night in mid-October, Knox, Kercher, Silenzi, and another basement resident met a basketball court acquaintance of the Italians, Rudy Guede, in the basement apartment. At 4:30 a.m. Kercher left, saying she was going to bed, and Knox followed her out. Guede spent the rest of the night in the basement. Knox recalled a second night out with Kercher and Silenzi in which Guede joined them in the basement apartment.\nThree weeks before her death, Kercher went with Knox to the EuroChocolate festival. On October 20, Kercher became romantically involved with Silenzi after going to a nightclub with him as part of a small group that included Knox. Guede visited the basement later that day. On October 25, Kercher and Knox went to a concert, where Knox met Raffaele Sollecito, a 23-year-old software engineering student. Knox began spending her time at his flat, a five-minute walk from Via della Pergola 7.\n\n\n=== Discovery of Meredith Kercher's body ===\n\nNovember 1 was a public holiday, and the Italians living in the building were away. It is believed that after watching a movie at a friend's house, Kercher returned home around 9 pm that evening and was alone in the building. Just after midday on November 2, Knox called Kercher's English phone. But contrary to her normal practice, the call was not answered. Knox then called her roommate Filomena Romanelli, and in a mixture of Italian and English said she was worried something had happened to Kercher, because upon going to the Via della Pergola 7 apartment earlier that morning, Knox had noticed an open front door, bloodstains (including a footprint) in the bathroom, and Kercher's bedroom door locked. Knox and Sollecito then went to Via della Pergola 7, and upon getting no answer from Kercher, unsuccessfully tried to break in the bedroom door, leaving it noticeably damaged. At 12:47 p.m., Knox called her mother, who advised her to contact the police.\nSollecito called the Carabinieri, the national gendarmerie of Italy, getting through at 12:51 p.m. He was recorded telling them there had been a break-in with nothing taken, and the emergency was that Kercher's door was locked, she was not answering calls to her phone, and there were bloodstains. Police telecommunications investigators arrived to inquire about an abandoned phone, which was in fact Kercher's Italian unit. Romanelli arrived and took over, explaining the situation to the police who were informed about Kercher's English phone, which had been handed in as a result of its ringing when Knox called it. On discovering Kercher's English phone had been found dumped, Romanelli demanded that the policemen force Kercher's bedroom door open, but they did not think the circumstances warranted damaging private property. The door was then kicked in by a friend of Romanelli, and Kercher's body was discovered on the floor. She had been stabbed and had died of blood loss from neck wounds.\n\n\n=== Investigation ===\nThe first detectives on the scene were Monica Napoleoni and her superior Marco Chiacchiera. Napoleoni conducted the initial interviews and quizzed Knox about her failure to immediately raise the alarm, which was later widely seen as an anomalous feature of Knox's behavior. During her initial questioning, Knox told authorities that Lumumba had broken into the home she shared with Kercher and other roommates before sexually assaulting and killing her. Knox said that she had spent the night of 1 November with Sollecito at his flat, smoking marijuana, watching the French film Amélie, and having sex. Sollecito told police he could not remember if Knox was with him that evening or not. According to Knox, Napoleoni had been hostile to her from the outset. Chiacchiera discounted the signs of a break-in, deeming them clearly faked by the killer. The police were not told the extent of Kercher's relationship with Silenzi in initial interviews. On November 4, Chiacchiera was quoted as saying that someone known to Kercher might have been let into the apartment and be responsible for her murder. The same day, Guede is believed to have left Perugia.\n\n\n=== Interviews, arrest, and arraignment ===\nOver the following days, Knox was repeatedly interviewed as a witness. She told police that on November 1, she received a text from Lumumba advising that her evening waitressing shift had been cancelled, so she had stayed over at Sollecito's apartment, only going back to the apartment she shared with Kercher on the morning the body was discovered. On the night of November 5, Knox voluntarily went to the police station. Knox was not provided with legal counsel, as Italian law only mandates the appointment of a lawyer for someone suspected of a crime. Knox said she had requested a lawyer but was told it would make things worse for her.\nKnox testified that prior to the trial she had spent hours maintaining her original story, that she had been with Sollecito at his flat all night and had no knowledge of the murder, but a group of police would not believe her.\nPolice arrested Knox, Sollecito, and Patrick Lumumba on November 6, 2007. They were taken into custody and charged with the murder. Customers who Lumumba had been serving at his bar on the night of the murder gave him an alibi, and Lumumba was released. Chiacchiera, who thought the arrests were premature, dropped out of the investigation soon afterward, leaving Napoleoni in charge of a major investigation for the first time in her career.\nKnox's first meeting with her legal counsel was on November 11. \nAfter his bloodstained fingerprints were found on bedding under Kercher's body, Guede (who had fled to Germany) was extradited back to Italy. Guede, Knox, and Sollecito were then charged with committing the murder together. On November 30, a panel of three judges endorsed the charges and ordered Knox and Sollecito held in detention pending a trial.\nKnox became the subject of unprecedented pre-trial media coverage because of leaks from the prosecution, including a best-selling Italian book whose author imagined or invented incidents that were purported to have occurred in Knox's private life.\n\n\n=== Trial of Guede ===\nGuede fled to Germany shortly after the murder. During a November 19, 2007 Skype conversation with his friend Giacomo Benedetti, Guede did not mention Knox or Sollecito as being in the building on the night of the murder. Later his account changed and he indirectly implicated them in the murder, which he denied involvement in. Guede was arrested in Germany on November 20, then extradited to Italy on December 6. Guede opted to be tried in a special fast-track procedure by Judge Micheli. He was not charged with having had a knife. He did not testify and was not questioned about his statements, which he had changed compared to what he originally said. \nIn October 2008, Guede was found guilty of the sexual assault and murder of Kercher and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. His prison sentence was ultimately reduced to 16 years. He was later given an early release in December 2020 and authorized to finish his sentence with community service. Amanda Knox was dissatisfied with his early release and spoke publicly against it.\n\n\n=== First trial of Knox and Sollecito ===\nIn 2009, Knox and Sollecito pleaded not guilty at a corte d'assise on charges of murder, sexual assault, carrying a knife (which Guede had not been charged with), simulating a burglary, and theft of €300, two credit cards, and two mobile phones. There was no charge in relation to Kercher's missing keys to the entry door and her bedroom door, although Guede's trial judgement said he had not stolen anything. There was a separate but concurrent trial of Knox with the same jury as her murder trial, in which she was accused of falsely denouncing her employer for the murder. Knox's police interrogation was deemed improper and ruled inadmissible for the murder trial, but was heard in her nominally separate trial for false denunciation.\n\n\n==== Prosecution case ====\nAccording to the prosecution, Knox's first call of November 2, to Kercher's English phone, was to ascertain if Kercher's phones had been found, and Sollecito had tried to break in the bedroom door because after he and Knox locked it behind them, they realized they had left something that might incriminate them. Knox's call to her mother in Seattle, 15 minutes before the discovery of the body, was said by prosecutors to show Knox was acting as if something serious might have happened before the point in time when an innocent person would have such concern.\nA prosecution witness, homeless man Antonio Curatolo, said Knox and Sollecito were in a nearby square on the night of the murder. Prosecutors advanced a single piece of forensic evidence linking Sollecito to Kercher's bedroom, where the murder had taken place: fragments of his DNA on Kercher's bra clasp. Giulia Bongiorno, leading Sollecito's defence, questioned how Sollecito's DNA could have gotten on the small metal clasp of the bra, but not on the fabric of the bra back strap from which it was torn. \"How can you touch the hook without touching the cloth?\" Bongiorno asked. The back strap of the bra had multiple traces of DNA belonging to Guede. According to the prosecution's reconstruction, Knox had attacked Kercher in her bedroom, repeatedly banged her head against a wall, forcefully held her face, and tried to strangle her. Guede, Knox, and Sollecito had removed Kercher's jeans and held her on her hands and knees while Guede had sexually assaulted her. Knox had cut Kercher with a knife before inflicting the fatal stab wound, then faked a burglary. The judge pointedly questioned Knox about a number of details, especially concerning her phone calls to her mother and Romanelli.\n\n\n==== Defense case ====\nThe defense suggested that Guede was a lone killer who had murdered Kercher after breaking in. Knox's lawyers pointed out that no shoe prints, clothing fibers, hairs, fingerprints, skin cells, or DNA of Knox's were found on Kercher's body, clothes, handbag, or anywhere else in Kercher's bedroom. The prosecution alleged that all forensic traces in the room that would have incriminated Knox had been wiped away by her and Sollecito. Knox's lawyers said it would have been impossible to selectively remove her traces, and emphasized that Guede's shoe prints, fingerprints, and DNA were found in Kercher's bedroom.\nGuede's DNA was on the strap of Kercher's bra, which had been torn off, and his DNA was found on a vaginal swab taken from her body. Guede's bloody palm print was on a pillow that had been placed under Kercher's hips. Guede's DNA, mixed with Kercher's, was on the left sleeve of her bloody sweatshirt and in bloodstains inside her shoulder bag, from which €300 and credit cards had been stolen. Both sets of defence lawyers requested the judges to order independent reviews of evidence including DNA and the compatibility of the wounds with the alleged murder weapon; the request was denied. In final pleas to the court, Sollecito's lawyer described Knox as \"a weak and fragile girl\" who had been \"duped by the police\". Knox's lawyer pointed to text messages between Knox and Kercher as showing that they had been friends.\n\n\n=== Verdict and controversy ===\nOn December 5, 2009, Knox, by then 22, was convicted on charges of faking a break-in, defamation, sexual violence, and murder, and was sentenced to 26 years imprisonment. Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years. In Italy, opinion was not generally favorable toward Knox, and an Italian law professor remarked: \"This is the simplest and fairest criminal trial one could possibly think of in terms of evidence.\"\nIn the United States, the verdict was widely viewed as a miscarriage of justice. American lawyers expressed concern about pre-trial publicity, and statements excluded from the murder case being allowed for a contemporaneous civil suit heard by the same jury. Knox's defense attorneys were seen, by American standards, as passive in the face of the prosecution's use of character assassination. Although acknowledging that Knox might have been a person of interest for American police in similar circumstances, journalist Nina Burleigh, who had spent months in Perugia during the trial while researching a book on the case, said the conviction had not been based on solid proof, and there had been resentment toward the Knox family that amounted to \"anti-Americanism\".\nA number of US experts spoke out against DNA evidence used by the prosecution. According to consultant Greg Hampikian, director of the Idaho Innocence Project, the Italian forensic police could not replicate the key result, claimed to have successfully identified DNA at levels below those an American laboratory would attempt to analyze, and never supplied validation of their methods. Knox was indicted in 2010 on charges of defamation against the police for saying she had been struck across her head during the interview in which she incriminated herself.\nIn May 2011, Hampikian said forensic results from the crime scene pointed to Guede as the killer and to his having acted on his own.\n\n\n== Acquittal and release ==\n\nA corte d'assise verdict of guilty is not a definitive conviction. A corte d'assise d'appello reviews the case in what is essentially a new trial. The appeal (or second grade) trial began November 2010 and was presided over by Judges Claudio Pratillo Hellmann and Massimo Zanetti. A court-ordered review of the contested DNA evidence by independent experts noted numerous basic errors in the gathering and analysis of the evidence, and concluded that no evidential trace of Kercher's DNA had been found on the alleged murder weapon, which police had found in Sollecito's kitchen. The review found the forensic police examination showed evidence of multiple males' DNA fragments on the bra clasp, which had been lost on the floor for 47 days. The court-appointed expert testified that the context strongly suggested contamination. On October 3, 2011, Knox and Sollecito were found not guilty of the murder.\nIn an official statement giving the grounds for the acquittals, Hellmann said Knox had been confused by interviews of \"obsessive duration\" in a language she was still learning, and forensic evidence did not support the idea that Knox and Sollecito had been present at the murder. It was emphasized that Knox's first calls raised the alarm and brought the police, which made the prosecution's assertion that she had been trying to delay discovery of the body untenable. Her and Sollecito's accounts failing to completely match did not constitute evidence that they had given a false alibi. Discounting Curatolo's testimony as self-contradictory, the judges observed that he was a heroin addict. Having noted that there was no evidence of any phone calls or texts between Knox or Sollecito and Guede, the judges concluded there was a \"material non-existence\" of evidence to support the guilty verdicts, and that an association among Sollecito, Knox, and Guede to commit the murder was \"far from probable\".\nThe false accusation conviction in relation to her employer was upheld, and Judge Hellman imposed a three-year sentence, although this did not result in additional incarceration, being less than Knox had already served. She was immediately released, whereupon she quickly returned to her Seattle home.\nKnox wrote a letter to Corrado Maria Daclon, Secretary General of the Italy–USA Foundation, the day after regaining her freedom:\n\nTo hold my hand and offer support and respect throughout the obstacles and the controversy, there were Italians. There was the Italy–USA Foundation, and many others that shared my pain and that helped me survive, with hope. I am eternally grateful for their caring hospitality and their courageous commitment. To those that wrote me, that defended me, that stood by me, that prayed for me... I am forever grateful to you.\n\n\n=== Retrial ===\nOn March 26, 2013, Italy's highest court, the Supreme Court of Cassation, set aside the acquittals of the Hellmann second level trial. The Court ruled that the Hellmann acquittals had gone beyond the remit of a corte d'assise d'appello by not ordering new DNA tests and by failing to give weight to circumstantial evidence in context, such as Knox's accusation against the bar owner in the disputed interviews. A note Knox composed in the police station (not mentioning Guede) was regarded by the Supreme Court as confirmation that she and Guede were present in Via della Pergola 7 while Kercher was attacked. A retrial was ordered. Knox was represented, but remained in the United States.\nJudge Nencini presided at the retrial, and granted a prosecution request for analysis of a previously unexamined DNA sample found on a kitchen knife of Sollecito's, which the prosecution alleged was the murder weapon based on the forensic police reporting that Kercher's DNA was on it, a conclusion discredited by court-appointed experts at the appeal trial. When the unexamined sample was tested, no DNA belonging to Kercher was found. On January 30, 2014, Knox and Sollecito were found guilty. In their written explanation, the judges emphasized Guede's fast-track verdict report as a judicial reference point establishing that he had not acted alone. The Nencini verdict report said there must have been a cleanup to remove traces of Knox from the building while leaving Guede's. The report said that there had been no burglary, and the signs of one were staged.\n\n\n=== Forensic controversy continues ===\nAlthough not part of the defense's team of experts, an authority on the forensic use of DNA, Professor Peter Gill, publicly said that the case against Knox and Sollecito was misconceived because they had a legitimate excuse for their DNA being present on Sollecito's kitchen knife, and in the crime scene apartment. According to Gill, the DNA fragment from Sollecito on the bra clasp could have gotten there through Sollecito having touched the handle of Kercher's door while trying to force it, enabling transfer of his DNA to the bra clasp inside the bedroom on the latex gloves used by investigators.\n\n\n=== Final decision ===\nOn March 27, 2015, the ultimate appeal by Knox and Sollecito was heard by the Supreme Court of Cassation; it ruled that the case was without foundation, thereby definitively acquitting them of the murder. Her defamation conviction was upheld, but the three-year sentence was deemed served by the time she had already spent in prison. Rather than merely declaring that there were errors in the earlier court cases or that there was not enough evidence to convict, the court ruled that Knox and Sollecito were innocent of involvement in the murder.\nOn September 7, 2015, the Court published the report on the acquittal, citing \"glaring errors\", \"investigative amnesia\", and \"guilty omissions\", where a five-judge panel said that the prosecutors who won the original murder conviction failed to prove a \"whole truth\" to back up the scenario that Knox and Sollecito killed Kercher. They also stated that there were \"sensational failures\" (clamorose defaillance) in the investigation, and that the lower court had been guilty of \"culpable omissions\" (colpevoli omissioni) in ignoring expert testimony that demonstrated contamination of evidence.\nThe delegate supreme judge, court adviser Gennaro Marasca, made public the reasons of absolution. First, none of the evidence demonstrated that either Knox or Sollecito was present at the crime scene. Second, they cannot have \"materially participated in the homicide\", since absolutely no \"biological traces ... could be attributed to them in the room of the murder or on the body of the victim, where in contrast numerous traces were found attributable to Guede\".\n\n\n=== Compensation ===\nOn January 24, 2019, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ordered Italy to pay compensation to Knox for violating her rights in the hours after her arrest in Perugia. Italy was ordered to pay Knox €18,400 (about US$20,800) for not providing her with either a lawyer or a competent interpreter when she was first held in custody.\n\n\n=== Retrial of defamation of Patrick Lumumba ===\nBased on the ECHR's ruling that she should have been provided with a lawyer and a competent interpreter during the \"obsessively long\" and implicitly violent police interviews (Knox had been acquitted of defamation for saying policewomen had struck her during the interrogation), Knox appealed her conviction for defamation of Patrick Lumumba, since the statement that he was involved was made during those interviews, at the same time that it was claimed that she had implicated herself. This was her only remaining conviction, and the appeal was enabled by a reform to the code of criminal procedure made in 2022. On 13 October 2023, the Court of Cassation ordered a retrial of this matter. \nIn June 2024, an Italian appellate court upheld Amanda Knox's slander conviction for falsely accusing Patrick Lumumba of murdering Meredith Kercher in 2007. She was not sentenced to additional prison time, as she had already served the length of the original slander sentence, four years, in detention following her wrongful imprisonment for Kercher's murder.\n\n\n== Personal and professional life ==\n\nAfter returning to the United States in late 2011, Knox completed her degree and worked on a book about her case. She was often followed by paparazzi. Her family incurred large debts from the years of supporting her in Italy and were left insolvent, the proceeds from Waiting to Be Heard: A Memoir having gone to pay legal fees to her Italian lawyers. Knox has been a reviewer and journalist for what then was West Seattle Herald (later subsumed into Westside Seattle), and attended events of the Innocence Project and related organizations. \nIn a 2017 interview, Knox said she was devoting herself to writing and activism for the wrongfully accused. She hosted The Scarlet Letter Reports on Facebook Watch, a series which examined the \"gendered nature of public shaming\". Knox has also hosted other podcasts, including The Truth About True Crime and Labyrinths. She has been a featured speaker at fundraising events for non-profits, including the Innocence Project. In June 2019, Knox returned to Italy as a keynote speaker at a conference on criminal justice, where she was part of a panel titled \"Trial by Media\".\nMeredith Kercher's family said through their lawyer that they have \"not been pleased with the initiatives Amanda Knox has undertaken over the years\" and accused her of attempting to profit from Kercher's murder with her public activities.\nOn February 29, 2020, Knox married author Christopher Robinson, who is connected to the Robinson Newspapers, owner of the Westside Seattle newspaper. They had first met after Knox's return to Seattle in 2011, and announced their engagement in 2019. In an October 2021 interview with The New York Times, Knox announced the birth of their first child, a daughter, who had been born several months prior. In September 2023, Knox gave birth to their second child, a son.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nBurleigh, Nina (2011). The Fatal Gift of Beauty: The Trials of Amanda Knox.

        "title": "XXX (2002 film)",
        "content": "XXX (stylized as xXx and pronounced Triple X) is a 2002 American action spy film directed by Rob Cohen, produced by Neal H. Moritz and written by Rich Wilkes. The first installment in the xXx film series, the film stars Vin Diesel as Xander Cage, a thrill-seeking extreme sports enthusiast, stuntman, and rebellious athlete-turned-reluctant spy for the National Security Agency. Cage is sent on a dangerous mission to infiltrate a group of potential Russian terrorists in Central Europe. The film also stars Asia Argento, Marton Csokas, and Samuel L. Jackson. Cohen, Moritz, and Diesel had previously worked on The Fast and the Furious (2001) as director, producer and cast member respectively. The film grossed $277.4 million worldwide and was followed by two sequels, xXx: State of the Union (2005) and xXx: Return of Xander Cage (2017).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nRussian terrorist group Anarchy 99 acquires the biochemical weapon \"Silent Night\", presumed missing since the fall of the Soviet Union. Undercover NSA agent Jim McGrath is assigned to recover the weapon but is killed by Anarchy 99 at a Rammstein concert.\nNSA Agent Augustus Gibbons suggests sending Xander \"XXX\" Cage, an extreme sports professional wanted for unlawful protesting, citing his lack of ties to the US government. Under Gibbons' supervision, Cage passes two field tests and reluctantly accepts the job, as the other option is prison.\nIn Prague, Cage meets his team which includes his supervisor, Czech agent Milan Sova. While scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage identifies Sova as a police officer, earning him favor with the group and catching the attention of the leader Yorgi. Cage asks Yorgi about purchasing high end sports cars, and Yorgi's girlfriend and lieutenant Yelena, gives Cage an account number.\nGibbons calls Cage about changes to the plan but is impressed when he gives them information provided by Kolya, Yorgi's star-struck younger brother. Tech-specialist Agent Toby Shavers then provides Cage with gadgets including a revolver with special ammo, binoculars that can see through walls and explosives disguised as bandages.\nAs Cage attends the car deal he made with Yorgi, Sova attempts to intercede. Using the special ammo, Cage fakes Sova's death. Having earned Yorgi's trust, Cage joins Anarchy 99. Yorgi brings Cage back to a castle after a dance party at one of his nightclubs that serves as Anarchy 99's headquarters. Cage, while searching for the biochemical weapon, catches Yelena investigating Yorgi's secret safe. He takes her to a nearby restaurant to discuss the matter and reveals his true identity.\nSova betrays Cage to Yorgi, so he sends his trusted sniper Kirill to kill him. While watching the pair, Kirill, who is in love with Yelena, warns her. As Cage and Yelena stage a fight, the NSA suddenly appears to capture him, and Yelena is taken back to Anarchy 99.\nCage meets with Gibbons, who demands he return to America as his cover is blown and special forces are planning to assault the castle. He refuses, fearing for Yelena's life and bitter that Sova blew his cover. Cage sneaks into Yorgi's castle and follows him into a secret underground lab. Overhearing his plan to launch \"Silent Night\" from the water-borne drone Ahab; he first tests the weapon on the scientists who developed it, to Cage and Yelena's horror. Cage flees the area after killing Kolya. At his hideout, Sova is waiting for him, now with Yorgi. Yelena saves Cage, revealing herself to be an abandoned undercover Russian Federal Security Service agent. Cage relays Yorgi's plans to the NSA in return for Yelena's asylum.\nAgainst orders, Shavers heavily arms Cage's car, who then parachutes from a plane on a snowboard near Anarchy 99's communication tower. The avalanche he starts destroys the tower but he is captured by Yorgi, who already knew Yelena's identity. As Yorgi prepares to kill them, the special forces attack. Cage and Yelena free themselves, but Yorgi launches Ahab before Cage kills him. The Czech military prepares to destroy Ahab with airstrikes, though this will release some of the biochemical agent. Cage and Yelena take his heavily modified car, to catch up to Ahab. Cage harpoons and disables the weapon moments before it goes off.\nCage and Yelena are recovered, and Gibbons follows through on his promises. Sometime later, the couple is relaxing in Bora Bora when Gibbons contacts him for another mission, but Cage ignores him.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nVin Diesel as Xander \"XXX\" Cage, a thrill-seeking American extreme sports enthusiast, stuntman, and anti-establishment activist. Idolized in some sub-cultures, Cage is also hunted by the authorities and he is offered a deal to become a spy for the National Security Agency in exchange for leniency, the agency requiring an agent who can do the current job without the military professional training that Anarchy 99's background will allow them to recognise.\nSamuel L. Jackson as Augustus Gibbons, a high-ranking official in the National Security Agency who has the power to give Cage a pardon for his crimes. He uses this fact as leverage to recruit Cage for a mission because he knows Cage is the only person who could successfully infiltrate Anarchy 99, recognising the benefits of Cage's rebellious attitude and unorthodox methods.\nWilliam Hope as Roger Donnan, the associate and administrator of the National Security Agency.\nDanny Trejo as \"El Jefe\", a torturer for a Colombian drug cartel.\nAsia Argento as Yelena, Yorgi's apparent girlfriend. Originally a Russian intelligence agent, sent to watch over Yorgi but has since been abandoned by her superiors. Yelena becomes romantically involved with Cage and he attempts to get her political asylum in the United States for her assistance in bringing down Yorgi.\nMarton Csokas as Yorgi, a former soldier in the Soviet Army, now a wealthy hedonist owning a string of properties around Eastern Europe, including a castle and nightclubs. Yorgi is also the leader of Anarchy 99, a group of militant anarchists with a disdain for all forms of government and authority, and society in general. His ultimate aim is complete lawlessness across the world.\nMichael Roof as Toby Lee Shavers, an NSA techno-genius and gadget specialist.\nRichy Müller as Milan Sova, a cop and double agent.\nWerner Daehn as Kirill, a member of Anarchy 99, cigarette addict and sharpshooter.\nPetr Jákl as Kolya, Yorgi's younger brother.\nJan Pavel Filipensky as Viktor, a member of Anarchy 99 and close friend of Yorgi. He is usually with Yorgi wherever he goes.\nTom Everett as Dick Hotchkiss, a conservative California State Senator; his car is stolen and wrecked by Cage prior to his recruitment by the NSA, as a protest against some of Hotchkiss's policies.\nThomas Ian Griffith as Jim McGrath, an undercover agent killed by Anarchy 99 while trying to retrieve the Silent Night weapon.\nEve as J.J., Xander's friend\nLeila Arcieri as Jordan King\nRammstein as themselves\nOrbital as themselves\nTo imply Xander Cage's credibility within extreme sport subcultures, various personalities make cameo appearances:\n\nTony Hawk makes a cameo appearance in the Corvette scene from the bottom of the bridge driving the getaway Cadillac, (near the beginning of the film) and skating over a half-pipe at Xander's place later.\nMike Vallely also makes a cameo as a cameraman and an extra. Pro motocross rider Carey Hart is seen in the back seat of the Cadillac driven by Tony Hawk.\nBMX rider Mat Hoffman exchanges lines with Xander during the party scene.\nAlso during the party scene, Josh Todd (the lead singer of Buckcherry) makes a cameo appearance though he never turns around, but his suicide king of hearts tattoo can be seen on his back.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn July 2001, it was announced that Vin Diesel would receive in the neighborhood of $10 million to star in the film, with an initial release date of July 26, 2002. It is believed that before Diesel was cast, Eric Bana turned down the lead role of Xander Cage. In August 2001, Sony put up a large billboard advertising the film in Hollywood, before a script had been written.\nFilming took place at three locations. Most of the film is set in Prague, Czech Republic. The Corvette jump was filmed at the Foresthill Bridge in Auburn State Recreation Area, Auburn, California. The final scenes were set in Bora Bora, Tahiti, and other areas in southern West Virginia.\nSeveral Czech Su-22s were used for the film. It was one of the last actions of these aircraft – the Czech Air Force decommissioned Sukhois in 2002.\nVin Diesel did many of his own stunts, director Rob Cohen said: \"I think the thing is that Vin did more than he should have, but less than he wanted to.\" Diesel took a fall during the avalanche scene, and landed head first and wasn't moving, and Cohen was worried the star of the film might have broken his neck. A scene where Cage base jumps from a Corvette was performed by Tim Rigby wearing a Vin Diesel mask. The motorcycle jump was performed by professional motocross rider and stuntman Jeremy Stenberg, and Diesel's face was later added digitally.\nStunt player Harry O'Connor, Diesel's stunt double, was killed on April 4, 2002, when he hit a pillar of the Palacký Bridge in Prague while para-sailing during one of the action scenes. The accident occurred while filming the second take of the stunt; O'Connor's first attempt was completed without incident and can be seen in the completed film, which was dedicated to him.\nThe first few minutes of the film take place at a concert of German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein in Prague, performing the song \"Feuer Frei\". The same clip is available, but from the band's perspective (with only brief scenes from the film) in their video compilation Lichtspielhaus.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe film score was composed by Randy Edelman, a frequent collaborator of Cohen's. The film also featured a contemporary rock music soundtrack. Rammstein provided some of the music and was even featured in the film in the opening scene. During the club scene in Prague, Orbital can be seen playing their exclusive track \"Technologicque Park\" live before the dancing crowd. The soundtrack album also features Queens of the Stone Age, Drowning Pool, Flaw, Mushroomhead, Hatebreed, Nelly, Lil Wayne, N.E.R.D, Fermín IV and Moby. It was released on August 6, 2002, through Universal Records. It peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard 200, No. 16 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and No. 1 on the Top Soundtracks. The \"Tweaker remix\" of the song \"Adrenaline\" by Gavin Rossdale (the lead singer of Bush) was featured in the film, while the original version is included on the soundtrack. None of Edelman's score was included on the album, with a separate disc of his work released by Varèse Sarabande.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\n\nThe film opened in 3,374 theaters and grossed $44,506,103 in its opening weekend. It grossed a total of $142 million, and a further $135 million internationally for a worldwide total of $277.4 million worldwide.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 48% based on reviews from 180 critics, with an average rating of 5.59/10. The site's consensus reads: \"It has an endearing lack of seriousness, and Vin Diesel has more than enough muscle for the starring role, but ultimately, XXX is a missed opportunity to breathe new life into the spy thriller genre.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 48 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 3+1⁄2 stars out of 4, writing, \"In its own punk way, XXX is as good as a good Bond movie, and that's saying something.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \"It's hard to hate a movie, even one this droolingly crass, that knows how to laugh at itself.\" Adam Smith of Empire called the movie, \"Sporadically entertaining, but seriously hampered by a very choppy screenplay\", and rating it three out of five stars.\nThis film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Most Flatulent Teen-Targeted Movie, but lost to Jackass: The Movie.\n\n\n== See also ==\nXXX (video game)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nXXX at IMDb\nXXX at Box Office Mojo",

        "title": "Loni Anderson",
        "content": "Loni Kaye Anderson (August 5, 1945 – August 3, 2025) was an American actress. She is best known for playing receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on the CBS sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati (1978–1982), which earned her nominations for three Golden Globe Awards and two Emmy Awards.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAnderson was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on August 5, 1945, the daughter of Klaydon Carl \"Andy\" Anderson, an environmental chemist, and Maxine Hazel (née Kallin), a onetime model. She grew up in suburban Roseville, Minnesota. As a senior at Alexander Ramsey Senior High School, she was voted Queen of the Valentine's Day Winter Formal of 1963. As she stated in her autobiography My Life in High Heels, her father was going to name her Leilani, but he realized that when she got to her teen years, it was likely to be twisted (into \"Lay\" Lani) so it was changed to simply Loni. She had a sister, Andrea. According to Anderson, their maternal grandmother Hazel Kallin was a schoolteacher who also managed a Prohibition-era speakeasy-type dance hall.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAnderson's acting debut came with a bit part in the film Nevada Smith (1966), starring Steve McQueen. After that, she was mostly unemployed as an actress for nearly a decade, then she received guest roles on television series in the mid-1970s. She appeared in two episodes of S.W.A.T., then on the sitcom Phyllis, and on the detective series Police Woman and Harry O. She auditioned for the role of Chrissy on the sitcom Three's Company. She did not win the role, but in 1978 guest-starred as Susan Walters on a Season Two episode.\nAnderson's most famous acting role came as the sultry receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati (1978–1982). She was offered the role when producers saw a poster of her in a red swimsuit—a pose similar to Farrah Fawcett's famous 1976 poster. Hugh Wilson, the sitcom's creator, later said Anderson got the role because her body resembled Jayne Mansfield's and because she possessed the innocent sexuality of Marilyn Monroe. For her role, she was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards and two Emmy Awards. Although the series suffered in the Nielsen ratings throughout most of its four-year run, it had a strong following among teens, young adults, and disc jockeys. Owing to her rising popularity as the series' so-called \"main attraction\", Anderson walked out on the sitcom during the 1980 summer hiatus, requesting a substantial salary increase. While she was renegotiating her contract, she starred in the television film The Jayne Mansfield Story (1980). When the network agreed to her requests, she returned to the series and remained until its cancellation in 1982.\nAside from her acting career, Anderson became known for her colorful personal life, particularly her relationship with and marriage to actor Burt Reynolds. They starred in the comedy film Stroker Ace (1983), which was a critical and box-office failure. She later appeared as herself in the romantic comedy The Lonely Guy (1984), starring Steve Martin. She voiced Flo, a collie in the animated film All Dogs Go to Heaven (1989).\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, Anderson was teamed with Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter in the television series Partners in Crime (1984). Anderson later starred in a short-lived comedy series Easy Street (1986–1987). She appeared in television adaptations of classic Hollywood films, such as A Letter to Three Wives (1985) with Michele Lee, and Sorry, Wrong Number (1989), both of which received little attention. After starring in Coins in the Fountain (1990), Anderson received praise for her portrayal of comedian actress Thelma Todd in the television movie White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd (1991).\nIn the early 1990s, she attempted to co-star with her husband Burt Reynolds on his sitcom Evening Shade, but the network was not fond of the idea and replaced her with Marilu Henner. After Delta Burke was fired from the sitcom Designing Women in 1991, producers offered Anderson a role as Burke's replacement. However, the network balked at Anderson's salary demand. She agreed to return as Jennifer Marlowe on two episodes of The New WKRP in Cincinnati, a sequel to the original series. In 1993, Anderson was added to the third and final season of the sitcom Nurses, playing hospital administrator Casey MacAffee. Her subsequent roles included those in the television series Clueless, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and Melrose Place, and the films 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain and A Night at the Roxbury (both 1998).\nAnderson's autobiography My Life in High Heels was published in 1995. Growing up with parents who both smoked, Anderson witnessed the effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease often caused by smoking. In 1999, she became a spokesperson for a COPD support organization named COPD Together.\nIn April 2018, Anderson was seen promoting WKRP in Cincinnati and other television series on the MeTV television network. Though less frequent since the start of the 21st century, Anderson continued to act in television series, and played a lead role in the 2016–2020 web series My Sister is So Gay. On October 3, 2023, it was announced that Anderson would feature in the Lifetime film Ladies of the '80s: A Divas Christmas. According to the official synopsis, the movie follows five soap opera divas readying for a reunion show who take on playing cupid during Christmas to bring together their director and producer as they all learn the meaning of the true Christmas spirit. The ensemble cast was made up of Anderson, Linda Gray, Morgan Fairchild, Donna Mills, and Nicollette Sheridan.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n\nAnderson was married four times: to real estate developer Bruce Hasselberg (1964–1966), actor Ross Bickell (1974–1981), actor Burt Reynolds (1988–1994), and musician Bob Flick (2008 until her death). Flick, a founding member of the folk band the Brothers Four, first met Anderson at a movie premiere in Minneapolis in 1963. She had an acknowledged affair with her WKRP in Cincinnati co-star Gary Sandy near the end of her marriage with Bickell.\nAnderson had two children: a daughter, Deidra (fathered by Hasselberg), and a son, Quinton (adopted with Reynolds). She had four grandchildren from her two children.\nAnderson died of metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma on August 3, 2025, at the age of 79. She was cremated and interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television films ===\n\n\n=== Television series ===\n\n\n== Book ==\nAnderson, Loni; Warren, Larkin (1995).

        "content": "Clash in Paris was a 2025 professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by the American company WWE. It took place on Sunday, August 31, 2025, at the Paris La Défense Arena in Nanterre, France, and was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. It marked WWE's second PPV and livestreaming event held in France after Backlash in May 2024, and the first in the Paris metropolitan area.\nThe event featured John Cena's first and only appearance at a PPV and livestreaming event in France as an in-ring performer due to his retirement from professional wrestling at the end of 2025. The event was also the last WWE main roster PPV and livestreaming event to air on Peacock in the United States, as these events will begin airing on ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming service with September's Wrestlepalooza.\nSix matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Seth Rollins defeated CM Punk, LA Knight, and Jey Uso in a fatal four-way match to retain Raw's World Heavyweight Championship. In other prominent matches, John Cena defeated Logan Paul and in the opening bout, Roman Reigns defeated Bronson Reed.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of the American professional wrestling promotion WWE's event Backlash in 2024, which was their first pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event held in France, WWE President Nick Khan announced at a January 16, 2025, event in Las Vegas, Nevada that the company would be returning to France for another PPV and livestreaming event sometime later that year. On January 29, WWE officially announced through their YouTube channel and website that they would return to France on Sunday, August 31, 2025, for an event titled Clash in Paris, held in La Défense, Nanterre at the Paris La Défense Arena, marking the company's first event in the Paris metropolitan area. It was also announced that the September 1 episode of Monday Night Raw would emanate from the same venue. An additional five nights of WWE Live shows in Europe and three televised broadcasts of WWE's weekly shows Raw and Friday Night SmackDown preceding Clash in Paris and Monday's Raw, were also scheduled as part of the \"Road to Clash in Paris\" tour, concluding with the Raw after Clash in Paris. Clash in Paris was held for wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands.\nIn addition to airing on traditional PPV worldwide, it was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States, Netflix in most international markets, and the WWE Network in any remaining countries that had not yet transferred to Netflix due to pre-existing contracts. This was WWE's last main roster PPV and livestreaming event to air on Peacock, as ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming service will begin broadcasting these events in the United States starting with Wrestlepalooza on September 20, 2025. This changeover had originally been slated to begin with WrestleMania 42 in April 2026 upon the expiration of WWE's contract with Peacock in March, but as WWE had done some extra events, including each WrestleMania on Peacock since 2021 being two nights, Evolution in July 2025, and making the 2025 SummerSlam two nights, this fulfilled WWE's obligations to Peacock early for the main roster PPV and livestreaming events, allowing them to switch to ESPN sooner; Peacock will still air NXT's livestreaming events until at least March 2026, and will maintain other content, such as Saturday Night's Main Event, for the next several years.\n\n\n=== Storylines ===\nThe event included six matches that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.\nAt Money in the Bank on June 7, a villainous John Cena and Logan Paul teamed together in a losing effort. On the August 8 episode of SmackDown, after turning face the previous week, a now heroic Cena reflected over his career and subsequently issued an open challenge, which was answered by Paul. After an exchange of words, Cena wanted to face Paul on that night's episode, which Paul refused, instead challenging Cena to a match at Clash in Paris, which Cena accepted.\nIn June, Seth Rollins began feuding with LA Knight, with both competing in the Money in the Bank ladder match at the eponymous event, where Rollins won the briefcase after Rollins's stablemates Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed interfered. Knight and Rollins continued feuding, leading to a match at Saturday Night's Main Event XL, where Knight won after Rollins seemingly injured his knee. After that, Breakker competed in a number one contender's gauntlet match for a World Heavyweight Championship match at SummerSlam. During the match, Breakker eliminated all competitors, including Knight and Jey Uso, who also had his own problems with Rollins's group since after WrestleMania 41, and also wanted to win back the World Heavyweight Championship he had lost back on June. However, Breakker was eliminated by Rollins's longtime rival CM Punk, who earned the title match. On Night 1 of SummerSlam, Uso teamed with his cousin Roman Reigns to defeat Breakker and Reed in a tag team match, while later that night in the main event, Punk won the World Heavyweight Championship, only for Rollins to appear and reveal he had feigned his knee injury and subsequently cashed-in his Money in the Bank briefcase on Punk to win the championship. On the following episode of Raw, Rollins's group name was revealed as The Vision, and later that evening, Knight faced Rollins for the championship with Breakker and Reed banned from ringside, but it ended in a disqualification win for Rollins after Punk attacked him. The Vision subsequently got the upper hand on Punk and Knight. The following episode, Punk and Knight defeated Breakker and Reed by disqualification after Rollins attacked Punk. Uso then appeared to help Knight and Punk, brawling with The Vision. Raw General Manager Adam Pearce then announced that Rollins would defend the championship against Punk, Knight, and Uso in a fatal four-way match at Clash in Paris.\nOn the May 26 episode of Raw, after Rusev defeated Akira Tozawa, Rusev continued to attack Tozawa, with Sheamus making the save. Three weeks later, both Rusev and Sheamus competed in a King of the Ring tournament fatal-four way qualifying match, but neither won. They subsequently faced each other on the June 30 episode, where Rusev won, with a rematch taking place on the July 21 episode, where Sheamus won. A third match between both men took place on the August 4 episode, which ended in a double countout. On the August 18 episode, after several confrontations, Raw General Manager Adam Pearce announced that Sheamus and Rusev would face each other in a Good Ol' Fashioned Donnybrook match at Clash in Paris.\nAt Survivor Series: WarGames in November 2024, Roman Reigns and Bronson Reed were both apart of the men's WarGames match, where Reigns' team defeated Reed's team. Reed would take a hiatus due to an injury he sustained during the match, whilst Reigns would go on to main event Night 1 of WrestleMania 41 in April 2025, where Reigns was defeated by Seth Rollins in a triple threat match also involving CM Punk after Paul Heyman betrayed Reigns and Punk. Two nights later on Raw, Bron Breakker joined Rollins and Heyman's alliance and attacked Reigns, taking him out indefinitely. During this time, at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIX, Reed was also recruited into Rollins' group. Reigns would return on the July 14 episode of Raw, saving Punk and his cousin Jey Uso from a post-match assault by Reed and Breakker. Reigns and Uso subsequently defeated both Reed and Breakker in a tag team match at Night 1 of SummerSlam. Two nights later on Raw, Reigns was viciously attacked by Rollins' group, now known as The Vision, with Reed stealing Reigns' shoes after the assault, something Reed had also done a few weeks ago. Two weeks later on the August 18 episode, Reed and Rollins attempted to interfere in an Extreme Rules match between Uso and Breakker, only for Reigns to come out and thwart them, helping Uso defeat Breakker. After that, Reigns challenged Reed to a match at Clash in Paris, which Reed accepted. The match was subsequently made official by Raw General Manager Adam Pearce.\nOn the August 4 episode of Raw, Becky Lynch gloated over her successful defense of the WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship at SummerSlam, before being interrupted by Nikki Bella, who called Lynch a disappointment. After some exchange of words, Lynch punched Bella. Two weeks later, Lynch successfully defended the title against Natalya, who had taken issues with Lynch after her disrespect of Bella. After the match, Lynch attacked Natalya, but Bella appeared to make the save. On the next episode, Bella and Lynch engaged in another verbal confrontation, with Bella challenging Lynch for a match with the title on the line, which Lynch initially refused; however, she eventually agreed to defend the title against Bella at Clash in Paris.\nOn the July 11 episode of SmackDown, The Wyatt Sicks (Dexter Lumis and Joe Gacy) defeated The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. After that, The Street Profits vowed to regain the championship, and they competed in a Six-Pack Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the title at Night 2 of SummerSlam, where The Wyatt Sicks retained. On the subsequent episodes of SmackDown, both Melo Don't Miz (Carmelo Hayes and The Miz) and The Street Profits won their respective tag team matches; this led to a match between them on the August 29 episode in which the winning team would earn a WWE Tag Team Championship match. There, The Wyatt Sicks (Lumis, Gacy, Uncle Howdy, Erick Rowan, and Nikki Cross) distracted Miz, allowing The Street Profits to win the match and challenge Lumis and Gacy for the championship at Clash in Paris.\n\n\n==== Cancelled match ====\nAt the all-women's event Evolution, Raw's Stephanie Vaquer won the Evolution Battle Royal to earn a women's world championship match at Clash in Paris. The next night on Raw, it was confirmed that the match would be for Raw's Women's World Championship. Subsequently at SummerSlam the following month, Naomi retained the title, thus confirming that Naomi would defend the Women's World Championship against Vaquer at Clash in Paris. However, on the August 18 episode of Raw, Naomi had to relinquish the title due to maternity leave as Naomi announced she was pregnant with her first child. The following week, Raw General Manager Adam Pearce announced that there would not be a match for the vacant Women's World Championship at Clash in Paris, and instead, Vaquer would challenge a to be announced opponent at a later date to determine the new champion. Vaquer's opponent was confirmed as Iyo Sky with the title match taking place at Wrestlepalooza on September 20.\n\n\n== Event ==\n\n\n==== Preliminary matches ====\nThe event began with Roman Reigns taking on Bronson Reed (accompanied by Paul Heyman). Reigns attempted a Samoan Drop on Reed but collapsed under Reed's weight. As Reed played around with the shoes he stole from Reigns, Reigns clotheslined Reed over the top rope and out of the ring. As Reigns attempted a Superman Punch, Reed countered into a Death Valley Driver for a nearfall. In the final moments of the match, as Reed went to the top rope, Reigns cut him off with a Superman Punch and followed up with a second-rope Samoan Drop. Reigns performed a spear on Reed to win the match. Following the match, Heyman returned the shoes to Reigns, who applied a Guillotine Choke on Heyman. Breakker then performed a Spear on Reigns through the announce table. As Reigns went backstage, Breakker performed another Spear on Reigns. Reed performed two Tsunamis on Reigns before Jey Uso appeared. Breakker performed a Spear on Uso before Reed performed a third Tsunami on Reigns.\nIn a backstage segment, Raw General Manager Adam Pearce banned Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed from ringside during the World Heavyweight Championship match and if they showed up, they would be suspended indefinitely.\nIn the second match, The Wyatt Sicks (Dexter Lumis and Joe Gacy, accompanied by Erick Rowan, Uncle Howdy, and Nikki Cross) defended SmackDown's WWE Tag Team Championship against The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford, accompanied by B-Fab). In the end, while the referee was distracted, Howdy performed Sister Abigail on Ford outside the ring. Inside, Gacy and Lumis performed The Plague on Ford to retain the title.\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended Raw's Women's Intercontinental Championship against Nikki Bella. During the match, Bella performed the Bella Buster on Lynch onto the steel steps. Inside the ring, Bella performed the Manhandle Slam on Lynch for a nearfall. In the end, as Bella attempted the Dis-arm-her, Lynch countered into a backslide (which she calls the Lynch Pin) to retain the title.\nIn the fourth match, Rusev took on Sheamus in a Good Ol' Fashioned Donnybrook Match. Throughout the match, Rusev and Sheamus dismantled each other with shillelaghs, kendo sticks, steel stairs, and whiskey barrels. Sheamus performed White Noise on Rusev from a whiskey barrel through tables and performed a Brogue Kick inside the ring for a nearfall. After Rusev snatched a shillelagh across Sheamus' back for a nearfall, Rusev snapped it in half and applied the Accolade while wedging it between Sheamus' teeth, forcing Sheamus to submit.\nIn the penultimate match, John Cena took on Logan Paul. Paul performed a pop-up European Uppercut on Cena. Cena attempted an Attitude Adjustment, but Paul countered into a buckshot lariat for a nearfall. Paul's attempt at a Paul From Grace was countered into an Attitude Adjustment by Cena for a nearfall. Cena performed a Tornado DDT on Paul for a nearfall. Paul performed a Zig-Zag on Cena for a nearfall. Paul performed a swanton and a standing moonsault on Cena for another nearfall. As Paul attempted Cena's \"five moves of doom\", Cena performed another Attitude Adjustment on Paul for a nearfall. Paul performed a Knockout Punch and a Paul from Grace on Cena, with both resulting in nearfalls. Cena performed a Styles Clash on Paul for a nearfall. In the end, Paul performed a middle-rope crossbody on Cena, who rolled through and performed the Attitude Adjustment two more times on Paul to win the match.\n\n\n==== Main event ====\nIn the main event, Seth Rollins defended Raw's World Heavyweight Championship against CM Punk, LA Knight, and Jey Uso in a fatal four-way match. As Rollins attempted a Phoenix Splash, Uso moved out of the way and performed a superkick and an Uso Splash on Rollins. Punk broke up the pin and performed the GTS on Uso. Rollins broke it up with a stomp, but Punk kicked out. Rollins then performed stomps on Uso and Knight outside the ring. The ending came when Punk countered a stomp by Rollins through a chair and performed the GTS on Rollins but as he attempted a second GTS, Becky Lynch, Rollins' real-life wife, ran in to perform a low blow on Punk. Rollins pinned Punk following the Stomp onto a chair to retain the title.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWith the attendance record of 30,343, WWE claims that Clash in Paris has set the single event gate in this arena beating out Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour in 2024 although the exact gate figures are unclear.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Raw ===\nOn the following episode of Raw, it was announced that Roman Reigns would be out of action indefinitely with multiple fractured ribs, while Paul Heyman suffered a larynx contusion.\nAlso on  Raw, CM Punk wanted another shot at World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins for revenge. Punk was confronted by Women's Intercontinental Champion Becky Lynch, who knew that the crowd was chanting for Punk's wife, AJ Lee. Lynch gloated about Rollins' accomplishments and what she and Rollins did to get WWE to where it was now. Rollins then appeared, inviting Punk to say whatever he had to say to him. Lynch then slapped Punk multiple times before wishing him well.\nJey Uso and LA Knight addressed their failure to win the World Heavyweight Championship when The Vision (Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker) interrupted. Breakker then scheduled a tag team match featuring himself and Reed against Uso and Knight for that episode's main event, which The Vision won.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "title": "Cleopatra",
        "content": "Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator (Koine Greek: Κλεοπάτρα Θεά Φιλοπάτωρ, lit. 'Cleopatra father-loving goddess'; 70/69 BC – 10 or 12 August 30 BC) was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC, and the last active Hellenistic pharaoh. A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great. Her first language was Koine Greek, and she is the only Ptolemaic ruler known to have learned the Egyptian language, among several others. After her death, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end of the Hellenistic period in the Mediterranean, which had begun during the reign of Alexander (336–323 BC).\nBorn in Alexandria, Cleopatra was the daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes, who named her his heir before his death in 51 BC. Cleopatra began her reign alongside her brother Ptolemy XIII, but falling-out between them led to a civil war. Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt after losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus against his rival Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator, in Caesar's civil war. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy XIII had him ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied Alexandria. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings, but Ptolemy XIII's forces besieged Cleopatra and Caesar at the palace. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy XIII died in the Battle of the Nile. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers, and maintained a private affair with Cleopatra which produced a son, Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar's villa. After Caesar's assassination, followed shortly afterwards by the sudden death of Ptolemy XIV (possibly murdered on Cleopatra's order), she named Caesarion co-ruler as Ptolemy XV.\nIn the Liberators' civil war of 43–42 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman Second Triumvirate formed by Caesar's heir Octavian, Mark Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. After their meeting at Tarsos in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony which produced three children. Antony became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during his invasions of the Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. The Donations of Alexandria declared their children rulers over various territories under Antony's authority. Octavian portrayed this event as an act of treason, forced Antony's allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32 BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC Battle of Actium, Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. After his death, Cleopatra reportedly killed herself, probably by poisoning, to avoid being publicly displayed by Octavian in Roman triumphal procession.\nCleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern works of art. Roman historiography and Latin poetry produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later Medieval and Renaissance literature. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include Roman busts, paintings, and sculptures, cameo carvings and glass, Ptolemaic and Roman coinage, and reliefs. In Renaissance and Baroque art, she was the subject of many works including operas, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become a pop culture icon of Egyptomania since the Victorian era, and in modern times, Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts, burlesque satire, Hollywood films, and brand images for commercial products.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the Ancient Greek Kleopátra (Κλεοπάτρα), meaning \"glory of her father\", from κλέος (kléos, \"glory\") and πατήρ (patḗr, \"father\"). The masculine form would have been written either as Kleópatros (Κλεόπατρος) or Pátroklos (Πάτροκλος). Cleopatra was the name of Alexander the Great's sister Cleopatra of Macedonia, as well as the wife of Meleager in Greek mythology, Cleopatra Alcyone. Through the marriage of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra (a Seleucid princess), the name entered the Ptolemaic dynasty. Cleopatra's adopted title Theā́ Philopátōra (Θεᾱ́ Φιλοπάτωρα) means \"goddess who loves her father\".\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nPtolemaic pharaohs were crowned by the Egyptian high priest of Ptah at Memphis, but resided in the multicultural and largely Greek city of Alexandria, established by Alexander the Great. They spoke Greek and governed Egypt as Hellenistic Greek monarchs, refusing to learn the native Egyptian language. In contrast, Cleopatra could speak multiple languages by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler known to have learned the Egyptian language. Plutarch implies that she also spoke Ethiopian, the language of the \"Troglodytes\", Hebrew (or Aramaic), Arabic, the \"Syrian language\" (perhaps Syriac), Median, and Parthian, and she could apparently also speak Latin, although her Roman contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native Koine Greek. Aside from Greek, Egyptian, and Latin, these languages reflected Cleopatra's desire to restore North African and West Asian territories that once belonged to the Ptolemaic Kingdom.\nRoman interventionism in Egypt predated the reign of Cleopatra. When her grandfather Ptolemy IX Lathyros died in late 81 BC, he was succeeded by his daughter Berenice III. With opposition building at the royal court against the idea of a sole reigning female monarch, Berenice III accepted joint rule and marriage with her cousin and stepson Ptolemy XI Alexander II, an arrangement made by the Roman dictator Sulla. Ptolemy XI had his wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 BC, and was lynched soon after in the resulting riot over the assassination. Ptolemy XI, and perhaps his uncle Ptolemy IX or father Ptolemy X Alexander I, willed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to Rome as collateral for loans, giving the Romans legal grounds to take over Egypt, their client state, after the assassination of Ptolemy XI. The Romans chose instead to divide the Ptolemaic realm among the illegitimate sons of Ptolemy IX, bestowing Egypt on Ptolemy XII Auletes and Cyprus on another namesake son.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early childhood ===\n\nCleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother, presumably Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena (who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena), the mother of Cleopatra's older sister, Berenice IV Epiphaneia. Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC. The three younger children of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV Philopator, were born in the absence of his wife. Cleopatra's childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy. During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum, including the Library of Alexandria.\n\n\n=== Reign and exile of Ptolemy XII ===\n\nIn 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt, but his proposed bill and the similar bill of tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC were rejected. Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering remuneration and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen, such as Pompey during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and eventually Julius Caesar after he became Roman consul in 59 BC. However, Ptolemy XII's profligate behavior bankrupted him, and he was forced to acquire loans from the Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus.\nIn 58 BC the Romans annexed Cyprus and on accusations of piracy drove Ptolemy of Cyprus, Ptolemy XII's brother, to commit suicide instead of enduring exile to Paphos. Ptolemy XII remained publicly silent on the death of his brother, a decision which, along with ceding traditional Ptolemaic territory to the Romans, damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies. Ptolemy XII was then exiled from Egypt by force, traveling first to Rhodes, then Athens, and finally the villa of triumvir Pompey in the Alban Hills, near Praeneste, Italy.\nPtolemy XII spent roughly up to a year there on the outskirts of Rome, ostensibly accompanied by his daughter Cleopatra, then about 11. Berenice IV sent an embassy to Rome to advocate for her rule and oppose the reinstatement of her father. Ptolemy had assassins kill the leaders of the embassy, an incident that was covered up by his powerful Roman supporters. When the Roman Senate denied Ptolemy XII the offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to Egypt, he decided to leave Rome in late 57 BC and reside at the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.\nThe Roman financiers of Ptolemy XII remained determined to restore him to power. Pompey persuaded Aulus Gabinius, the Roman governor of Syria, to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII, offering him 10,000 talents for the proposed mission. Although it put him at odds with Roman law, Gabinius invaded Egypt in the spring of 55 BC by way of Hasmonean Judea, where Hyrcanus II had Antipater the Idumaean, father of Herod the Great, furnish the Roman-led army with supplies. As a young cavalry officer, Mark Antony was under Gabinius's command. He distinguished himself by preventing Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of Pelousion, and for rescuing the body of Archelaos, the husband of Berenice IV, after he was killed in battle, ensuring him a proper royal burial. Cleopatra, then 14 years of age, would have traveled with the Roman expedition into Egypt; years later, Antony would profess that he had fallen in love with her at this time.\n\nGabinius was put on trial in Rome for abusing his authority, for which he was acquitted. However, his second trial, for accepting bribes, led to his exile. He was recalled from exile seven years later, in 48 BC, by Caesar. Crassus replaced him as governor of Syria and extended his provincial command to Egypt, but Crassus was killed by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC. Ptolemy XII had Berenice IV and her wealthy supporters executed, seizing their properties. He allowed Gabinius's largely Germanic and Gallic Roman garrison, the Gabiniani, to harass people in the streets of Alexandria and installed his longtime Roman financier Rabirius as his chief financial officer.\nWithin a year Rabirius was placed under protective custody and sent back to Rome after his life was endangered for draining Egypt of its resources. Despite these problems, Ptolemy XII created a will designating Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs, oversaw major construction projects such as the Temple of Edfu and a temple at Dendera, and stabilized the economy. On 31 May 52 BC, Cleopatra was made a regent to Ptolemy XII, as indicated by an inscription in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. Rabirius was unable to collect the entirety of Ptolemy XII's debt by the time of the latter's death, and so it was passed on to his successors Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII.\n\n\n=== Reign ===\n\n\n==== Accession to the throne ====\n\nPtolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, when Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion. Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne. These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile, and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani, the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt. Inheriting her father's debts, Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 17.5 million drachmas.\nIn 50 BC Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, proconsul of Syria, sent his two eldest sons to Egypt, most likely to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria against the Parthians. The Gabiniani tortured and murdered these two, perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatra's court. Cleopatra sent the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment, but he sent them back to Cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication, which was the prerogative of the Roman Senate. Bibulus, siding with Pompey in Caesar's Civil War, failed to prevent Caesar from landing a naval fleet in Greece, which ultimately allowed Caesar to reach Egypt in pursuit of Pompey.\nBy 29 August 51 BC, official documents started listing Cleopatra as the sole ruler, evidence that she had rejected her brother Ptolemy XIII as a co-ruler. She had probably married him, but there is no record of this. The Ptolemaic practice of sibling marriage was introduced by Ptolemy II and his sister Arsinoe II. A long-held royal Egyptian practice, it was loathed by contemporary Greeks. By the reign of Cleopatra, however, it was considered a normal arrangement for Ptolemaic rulers.\nDespite Cleopatra's rejection of him, Ptolemy XIII still retained powerful allies, notably the eunuch Potheinos, his childhood tutor, regent, and administrator of his properties. Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included Achillas, a prominent military commander, and Theodotus of Chios, another tutor of Ptolemy XIII. Cleopatra seems to have attempted a short-lived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV, but by the autumn of 50 BC Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and began signing documents with his name before that of his sister, followed by the establishment of his first regnal date in 49 BC.\n\n\n==== Assassination of Pompey ====\n\nIn the summer of 49 BC, Cleopatra and her forces were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompey's son Gnaeus Pompeius arrived, seeking military aid on behalf of his father. After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC, Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece. In perhaps their last joint decree, both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius's request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops, including the Gabiniani, a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome. Losing the fight against her brother, Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes. By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to Roman Syria with her younger sister, Arsinoe IV, to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt. She returned with an army, but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brother's forces, including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her, so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern Nile Delta.\nIn Greece, Caesar and Pompey's forces engaged each other at the decisive Battle of Pharsalus on 9 August 48 BC, leading to the destruction of most of Pompey's army and his forced flight to Tyre, Lebanon. Given his close relationship with the Ptolemies, Pompey ultimately decided that Egypt would be his place of refuge, where he could replenish his forces. Ptolemy XIII's advisers, however, feared the idea of Pompey using Egypt as his base in a protracted Roman civil war. In a scheme devised by Theodotus, Pompey arrived by ship near Pelousion after being invited by a written message, only to be ambushed and stabbed to death on 28 September 48 BC. Ptolemy XIII believed he had demonstrated his power and simultaneously defused the situation by having Pompey's head, severed and embalmed, sent to Caesar, who arrived in Alexandria by early October and took up residence at the royal palace. Caesar expressed grief and outrage over the killing of Pompey and called on both Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra to disband their forces and reconcile with each other.\n\n\n==== Relationship with Julius Caesar ====\n\nPtolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army, in clear defiance of Caesar's demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival. Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar, but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women, she came to Alexandria to see him personally. Historian Cassius Dio records that she did so without informing her brother, dressed in an attractive manner, and charmed Caesar with her wit. Plutarch provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.\nWhen Ptolemy XIII realized that his sister was in the palace consorting directly with Caesar, he attempted to rouse the populace of Alexandria into a riot, but he was arrested by Caesar, who used his oratorical skills to calm the frenzied crowd. Caesar then brought Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII before the assembly of Alexandria, where Caesar revealed the written will of Ptolemy XII—previously possessed by Pompey—naming Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs. Caesar then attempted to arrange for the other two siblings, Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV, to rule together over Cyprus, thus removing potential rival claimants to the Egyptian throne while also appeasing the Ptolemaic subjects still bitter over the loss of Cyprus to the Romans in 58 BC.\nJudging that this agreement favored Cleopatra over Ptolemy XIII and that the latter's army of 20,000, including the Gabiniani, could most likely defeat Caesar's army of 4,000 unsupported troops, Potheinos decided to have Achillas lead their forces to Alexandria to attack both Caesar and Cleopatra. After Caesar managed to execute Potheinos, Arsinoe IV joined forces with Achillas and was declared queen, but soon afterward had her tutor Ganymedes kill Achillas and take his position as commander of her army. Ganymedes then tricked Caesar into requesting the presence of the erstwhile captive Ptolemy XIII as a negotiator, only to have him join the army of Arsinoe IV. The resulting siege of the palace, with Caesar and Cleopatra trapped together inside, lasted into the following year of 47 BC.\n\nSometime between January and March of 47 BC, Caesar's reinforcements arrived, including those led by Mithridates of Pergamon and Antipater the Idumaean. Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV withdrew their forces to the Nile, where Caesar attacked them. Ptolemy XIII tried to flee by boat, but it capsized, and he drowned. Ganymedes may have been killed in the battle. Theodotus was found years later in Asia, by Marcus Junius Brutus, and executed. Arsinoe IV was forcefully paraded in Caesar's triumph in Rome before being exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in the palace, most likely because she had been pregnant with Caesar's child since September 48 BC.\nCaesar's term as consul had expired at the end of 48 BC. However, Antony, an officer of his, helped to secure Caesar's appointment as dictator lasting for a year, until October 47 BC, providing Caesar with the legal authority to settle the dynastic dispute in Egypt. Wary of repeating the mistake of Cleopatra's sister Berenice IV in having a female monarch as sole ruler, Caesar appointed the 12-year-old Ptolemy XIV as joint ruler with the 22-year-old Cleopatra in a nominal sibling marriage, but Cleopatra continued living privately with Caesar. The exact date at which Cyprus was returned to her control is not known, although she had a governor there by 42 BC.\nCaesar is alleged to have joined Cleopatra for a cruise of the Nile and sightseeing of Egyptian monuments, although this may be a romantic tale reflecting later well-to-do Roman proclivities and not a real historical event. The historian Suetonius provided considerable details about the voyage, including use of Thalamegos, the pleasure barge constructed by Ptolemy IV, which during his reign measured 90 metres (300 ft) in length and 24 metres (80 ft) in height and was complete with dining rooms, state rooms, holy shrines, and promenades along its two decks, resembling a floating villa. Caesar could have had an interest in the Nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography; he was well-read in the works of Eratosthenes and Pytheas, and perhaps wanted to discover the source of the river, but turned back before reaching Ethiopia.\nCaesar departed from Egypt around April 47 BC, allegedly to confront Pharnaces II of Pontus, the son of Mithridates VI of Pontus, who was stirring up trouble for Rome in Anatolia. It is possible that Caesar, married to the prominent Roman woman Calpurnia, also wanted to avoid being seen together with Cleopatra when she had their son. He left three legions in Egypt, later increased to four, under the command of the freedman Rufio, to secure Cleopatra's tenuous position, but also perhaps to keep her activities in check.\n\nCaesarion, Cleopatra's alleged child with Caesar, was born sometime in 47, possibly on 23 June 47 BC if stele at the Serapeum of Saqqara that mentions \"King Caesar\" refers to him. Perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with Calpurnia, Caesar remained publicly silent about Caesarion (but perhaps accepted his parentage in private). Cleopatra, on the other hand, made repeated official declarations about Caesarion's parentage, naming Caesar as the father.\nCleopatra and Ptolemy XIV visited Rome sometime in late 46 BC, presumably without Caesarion, and were given lodging in Caesar's villa within the Horti Caesaris. As with their father Ptolemy XII, Caesar awarded both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV the legal status of \"friend and ally of the Roman people\" (Latin: socius et amicus populi Romani), in effect client rulers loyal to Rome. Cleopatra's visitors at Caesar's villa across the Tiber included the senator Cicero, who found her arrogant. Sosigenes of Alexandria, one of the members of Cleopatra's court, aided Caesar in the calculations for the new Julian calendar, put into effect 1 January 45 BC. The Temple of Venus Genetrix, established in the Forum of Caesar on 25 September 46 BC, contained a golden statue of Cleopatra (which stood there at least until the 3rd century AD), associating the mother of Caesar's child directly with the goddess Venus, mother of the Romans. The statue also subtly linked the Egyptian goddess Isis with the Roman religion.\nCleopatra's presence in Rome most likely had an effect on the events at the Lupercalia festival a month before Caesar's assassination. Antony attempted to place a royal diadem on Caesar's head, but the latter refused in what was most likely a staged performance, perhaps to gauge the Roman public's mood about accepting Hellenistic-style kingship. Cicero, who was present at the festival, mockingly asked where the diadem came from, an obvious reference to the Ptolemaic queen whom he abhorred. Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BC), but Cleopatra stayed in Rome until about mid-April, in the vain hope of having Caesarion recognized as Caesar's heir. However, Caesar's will named his grandnephew Octavian as the primary heir, and Octavian arrived in Italy around the same time Cleopatra decided to depart for Egypt.\nIt is suggested, based on Cicero's letter, that Cleopatra might have been pregnant at that time with her and Caesar's second child; if so, this pregnancy ended in the loss of the baby. A few months later, Ptolemy XIV died—allegedly poisoned by Cleopatra—and she elevated her son Caesarion as her co-ruler.\n\n\n==== Liberators' civil war ====\n\nOctavian, Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, in which they were each elected for five-year terms to restore order in the Republic and bring Caesar's assassins to justice. Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus, one of Caesar's assassins, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella, proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist, requesting military aid. She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems, while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella. These troops were captured by Cassius in Palestine.\nWhile Serapion, Cleopatra's governor of Cyprus, defected to Cassius and provided him with ships, Cleopatra took her own fleet to Greece to personally assist Octavian and Antony. Her ships were heavily damaged in a Mediterranean storm and she arrived too late to aid in the fighting. By the autumn of 42 BC, Antony had defeated the forces of Caesar's assassins at the Battle of Philippi in Greece, leading to the suicide of Cassius and Brutus.\nBy the end of 42 BC, Octavian had gained control over much of the western half of the Roman Republic and Antony the eastern half, with Lepidus largely marginalized. In the summer of 41 BC, Antony established his headquarters at Tarsos in Anatolia and summoned Cleopatra there in several letters, which she rebuffed until Antony's envoy Quintus Dellius convinced her to come. The meeting would allow Cleopatra to clear up the misconception that she had supported Cassius during the civil war and address territorial exchanges in the Levant, but Antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal, romantic relationship with the queen. Cleopatra sailed up the Kydnos River to Tarsos in Thalamegos, hosting Antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board the ship. Cleopatra managed to clear her name as a supposed supporter of Cassius, arguing she had really attempted to help Dolabella in Syria, and convinced Antony to have her exiled sister, Arsinoe IV, executed at Ephesus. Cleopatra's former rebellious governor of Cyprus was also handed over to her for execution.\n\n\n==== Relationship with Mark Antony ====\n\nCleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos, which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC. Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria, both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done. In Egypt, Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos. He also had his subordinates, such as Publius Ventidius Bassus, drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria.\nCleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner for producing further heirs, as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesar's demise. With his powers as a triumvir, Antony also had the broad authority to restore former Ptolemaic lands, which were currently in Roman hands, to Cleopatra. While it is clear that both Cilicia and Cyprus were under Cleopatra's control by 19 November 38 BC, the transfer probably occurred earlier in the winter of 41–40 BC, during her time spent with Antony.\nBy the spring of 40 BC, Antony left Egypt due to troubles in Syria, where his governor Lucius Decidius Saxa was killed and his army taken by Quintus Labienus, a former officer under Cassius who now served the Parthian Empire. Cleopatra provided Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories. She would not see Antony again until 37 BC, but she maintained correspondence, and evidence suggests she kept a spy in his camp. By the end of 40 BC, Cleopatra had given birth to twins, a boy named Alexander Helios and a girl named Cleopatra Selene II, both of whom Antony acknowledged as his children. Helios (the Sun) and Selene (the Moon) were symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation, as well as an indication that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the exploits of Alexander the Great by conquering the Parthians.\n\nMark Antony's Parthian campaign in the east was disrupted by the events of the Perusine War (41–40 BC), initiated by his ambitious wife Fulvia against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome. It has been suggested that Fulvia wanted to cleave Antony away from Cleopatra, but the conflict emerged in Italy even before Cleopatra's meeting with Antony at Tarsos. Fulvia and Antony's brother Lucius Antonius were eventually besieged by Octavian at Perusia (modern Perugia, Italy) and then exiled from Italy, after which Fulvia died at Sicyon in Greece while attempting to reach Antony. Her sudden death led to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at Brundisium in Italy in September 40 BC. Although the agreement struck at Brundisium solidified Antony's control of the Roman Republic's territories east of the Ionian Sea, it also stipulated that he concede Italia, Hispania, and Gaul, and marry Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a potential rival for Cleopatra.\nIn December 40 BC Cleopatra received Herod in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in Judea. Herod had been installed as a tetrarch there by Antony, but he was soon at odds with Antigonus II Mattathias of the long-established Hasmonean dynasty. The latter had imprisoned Herod's brother and fellow tetrarch Phasael, who was executed while Herod was fleeing toward Cleopatra's court. Cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment, but Herod declined and traveled to Rome, where the triumvirs Octavian and Antony named him king of Judea. This act put Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra, who would desire to reclaim the former Ptolemaic territories that comprised his new Herodian kingdom.\n\nRelations between Antony and Cleopatra perhaps soured when he not only married Octavia, but also sired her two children, Antonia the Elder in 39 BC and Antonia Minor in 36 BC, and moved his headquarters to Athens. However, Cleopatra's position in Egypt was secure. Her rival Herod was occupied with civil war in Judea that required heavy Roman military assistance, but received none from Cleopatra. Since the authority of Antony and Octavian as triumvirs had expired on 1 January 37 BC, Octavia arranged for a meeting at Tarentum, where the triumvirate was officially extended to 33 BC.\n With two legions granted by Octavian and a thousand soldiers lent by Octavia, Antony traveled to Antioch, where he made preparations for war against the Parthians.\nAntony summoned Cleopatra to Antioch to discuss pressing issues, such as Herod's kingdom and financial support for his Parthian campaign. Cleopatra brought her now three-year-old twins to Antioch, where Antony saw them for the first time and where they probably first received their surnames Helios and Selene as part of Antony and Cleopatra's ambitious plans for the future. In order to stabilize the east, Antony not only enlarged Cleopatra's domain, he also established new ruling dynasties and client rulers who would be loyal to him, yet would ultimately outlast him.\nIn this arrangement Cleopatra gained significant former Ptolemaic territories in the Levant, including nearly all of Phoenicia (Lebanon) minus Tyre and Sidon, which remained in Roman hands. She also received Ptolemais Akko (modern Acre, Israel), a city that was established by Ptolemy II. Given her ancestral relations with the Seleucids, she was granted the region of Coele-Syria along the upper Orontes River. She was even given the region surrounding Jericho in Palestine, but she leased this territory back to Herod. At the expense of the Nabataean king Malichus I (a cousin of Herod), Cleopatra was also given a portion of the Nabataean Kingdom around the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea, including Ailana (modern Aqaba, Jordan). To the west Cleopatra was handed Cyrene along the Libyan coast, as well as Itanos and Olous in Roman Crete. Although still administered by Roman officials, these territories nevertheless enriched her kingdom and led her to declare the inauguration of a new era by double-dating her coinage in 36 BC.\n\nAntony's enlargement of the Ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly controlled Roman territory was exploited by his rival Octavian, who tapped into the public sentiment in Rome against the empowerment of a foreign queen at the expense of their Republic. Octavian, fostering the narrative that Antony was neglecting his virtuous Roman wife Octavia, granted both her and Livia, his own wife, extraordinary privileges of sacrosanctity. Some 50 years before, Cornelia Africana, daughter of Scipio Africanus, had been the first living Roman woman to have a statue dedicated to her. She was now followed by Octavia and Livia, whose statues were most likely erected in the Forum of Caesar to rival that of Cleopatra's, erected by Caesar.\nIn 36 BC, Cleopatra accompanied Antony to the Euphrates in his journey toward invading the Parthian Empire. She then returned to Egypt, perhaps due to her advanced state of pregnancy. By the summer of 36 BC, she had given birth to Ptolemy Philadelphus, her second son with Antony.\nAntony's Parthian campaign in 36 BC turned into a complete debacle for a number of reasons, in particular the betrayal of Artavasdes II of Armenia, who defected to the Parthian side. After losing some 30,000 men, more than Crassus at Carrhae (an indignity he had hoped to avenge), Antony finally arrived at Leukokome near Berytus (modern Beirut, Lebanon) in December, engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops. Antony desired to avoid the risks involved in returning to Rome, and so he traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria to see his newborn son.\n\n\n==== Donations of Alexandria ====\n\nAs Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC, this time aimed at their ally Armenia, Octavia traveled to Athens with 2,000 troops in alleged support of Antony, but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses. Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch, only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria. When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony, although she refused to leave Antony's household. Octavian's confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west, including Sextus Pompeius and even Lepidus, the third member of the triumvirate, who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily.\nDellius was sent as Antony's envoy to Artavasdes II in 34 BC to negotiate a potential marriage alliance that would wed the Armenian king's daughter to Alexander Helios, the son of Antony and Cleopatra. When this was declined, Antony marched his army into Armenia, defeated their forces and captured the king and Armenian royal family. Antony then held a military parade in Alexandria as an imitation of a Roman triumph, dressed as Dionysus and riding into the city on a chariot to present the royal prisoners to Cleopatra, who was seated on a golden throne above a silver dais. News of this event was heavily criticized in Rome as a perversion of time-honored Roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an Egyptian queen.\n\nIn an event held at the gymnasium soon after the triumph, Cleopatra dressed as Isis and declared that she was the Queen of Kings with her son Caesarion, King of Kings, while Alexander Helios was declared king of Armenia, Media, and Parthia, and two-year-old Ptolemy Philadelphus was declared king of Syria and Cilicia. Cleopatra Selene II was bestowed with Crete and Cyrene. Antony and Cleopatra may have been wed during this ceremony. Antony sent a report to Rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims, now known as the Donations of Alexandria. Octavian wanted to publicize it for propaganda purposes, but the two consuls, both supporters of Antony, had it censored from public view.\nIn late 34 BC, Antony and Octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years. Antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed Lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in Italy, while Octavian accused Antony of unlawfully detaining the king of Armenia, marrying Cleopatra despite still being married to his sister Octavia, and wrongfully claiming Caesarion as the heir of Caesar instead of Octavian. The litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war have shaped the popular perceptions about Cleopatra from Augustan-period literature through to various media in modern times. Cleopatra was said to have brainwashed Mark Antony with witchcraft and sorcery and was as dangerous as Homer's Helen of Troy in destroying civilization. Pliny the Elder claims in his Natural History that Cleopatra once dissolved a pearl worth tens of millions of sesterces in vinegar just to win a dinner-party bet. The accusation that Antony had stolen books from the Library of Pergamum to restock the Library of Alexandria later turned out to be an admitted fabrication by Gaius Calvisius Sabinus.\nA papyrus document dated to February 33 BC, later used to wrap a mummy, contains the signature of Cleopatra, probably written by an official authorized to sign for her. It concerns certain tax exemptions in Egypt granted to either Quintus Caecillius or Publius Canidius Crassus, a former Roman consul and Antony's confidant who would command his land forces at Actium. A subscript in a different handwriting at the bottom of the papyrus reads \"make it happen\" or \"so be it\" (Ancient Greek: γινέσθωι, romanized: ginésthōi); this is likely the autograph of the queen, as it was Ptolemaic practice to countersign documents to avoid forgery.\n\n\n==== Battle of Actium ====\n\nIn a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1 January 33 BC, Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen. Before Antony and Octavian's joint imperium expired on 31 December 33 BC, Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian. In 32 BC, the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus became consuls. The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian, now a private citizen without public office, and introduced pieces of legislation against him. During the next senatorial session, Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls. Intimidated by this act, the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony.\nAntony and Cleopatra traveled together to Ephesus in 32 BC, where she provided him with 200 of the 800 naval ships he was able to acquire. Ahenobarbus, wary of having Octavian's propaganda confirmed to the public, attempted to persuade Antony to have Cleopatra excluded from the campaign against Octavian. Publius Canidius Crassus made the counterargument that Cleopatra was funding the war effort and was a competent monarch. Cleopatra refused Antony's requests that she return to Egypt, judging that by blocking Octavian in Greece she could more easily defend Egypt. Cleopatra's insistence that she be involved in the battle for Greece led to the defections of prominent Romans, such as Ahenobarbus and Lucius Munatius Plancus.\n\nDuring the spring of 32 BC Antony and Cleopatra traveled to Athens, where she persuaded Antony to send Octavia an official declaration of divorce. This encouraged Plancus to advise Octavian that he should seize Antony's will, invested with the Vestal Virgins. Although a violation of sacred and legal rights, Octavian forcefully acquired the document from the Temple of Vesta, and it became a useful tool in the propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra. Octavian highlighted parts of the will, such as Caesarion being named heir to Caesar, that the Donations of Alexandria were legal, that Antony should be buried alongside Cleopatra in Egypt instead of Rome, and that Alexandria would be made the new capital of the Roman Republic. In a show of loyalty to Rome, Octavian decided to begin construction of his own mausoleum at the Campus Martius. Octavian's legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 BC. With Antony's will made public, Octavian had his casus belli, and Rome declared war on Cleopatra, not Antony. The legal argument for war was based less on Cleopatra's territorial acquisitions, with former Roman territories ruled by her children with Antony, and more on the fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that Antony's triumviral authority had expired.\n\nAntony and Cleopatra had a larger fleet than Octavian, but the crews of Antony and Cleopatra's navy were not all well-trained, some of them perhaps from merchant vessels, whereas Octavian had a fully professional force. Antony wanted to cross the Adriatic Sea and blockade Octavian at either Tarentum or Brundisium, but Cleopatra, concerned primarily with defending Egypt, overrode the decision to attack Italy directly. Antony and Cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at Patrai in Greece, and by the spring of 31 BC they had moved to Actium, on the southern side of the Ambracian Gulf.\nCleopatra and Antony had the support of various allied kings, but Cleopatra had already been in conflict with Herod, and an earthquake in Judea provided him with an excuse to be absent from the campaign. They also lost the support of Malichus I, which would prove to have strategic consequences. Antony and Cleopatra lost several skirmishes against Octavian around Actium during the summer of 31 BC, while defections to Octavian's camp continued, including Antony's long-time companion Dellius and the allied kings Amyntas of Galatia and Deiotaros of Paphlagonia. While some in Antony's camp suggested abandoning the naval conflict to retreat inland, Cleopatra urged for a naval confrontation, to keep Octavian's fleet away from Egypt.\nOn 2 September 31 BC the naval forces of Octavian, led by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, met those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium. Cleopatra, aboard her flagship, the Antonias, commanded 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, at the rear of the fleet, in what was likely a move by Antony's officers to marginalize her during the battle. Antony had ordered that their ships should have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from the enemy, which Cleopatra, ever concerned about defending Egypt, used to swiftly move through the area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to the Peloponnese.\nBurstein writes that partisan Roman writers would later accuse Cleopatra of cowardly deserting Antony, but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible. Antony followed Cleopatra and boarded her ship, identified by its distinctive purple sails, as the two escaped the battle and headed for Tainaron. Antony reportedly avoided Cleopatra during this three-day voyage, until her ladies in waiting at Tainaron urged him to speak with her. The Battle of Actium raged on without Cleopatra and Antony until the morning of 3 September, and was followed by massive defections of officers, troops, and allied kings to Octavian's side.\n\n\n=== Downfall and death ===\n\nWhile Octavian occupied Athens, Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt. The couple then went their separate ways, Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory. She was afraid that news about the outcome of the battle of Actium would lead to a rebellion. It is uncertain whether or not, at this time, she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival, Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, in an attempt to strike an alliance with him.\nLucius Pinarius, Mark Antony's appointed governor of Cyrene, received word that Octavian had won the Battle of Actium before Antony's messengers could arrive at his court. Pinarius had these messengers executed and then defected to Octavian's side, surrendering to him the four legions under his command that Antony desired to obtain. Antony nearly committed suicide after hearing news of this but was stopped by his staff officers. In Alexandria he built a reclusive cottage on the island of Pharos that he nicknamed the Timoneion, after the philosopher Timon of Athens, who was famous for his cynicism and misanthropy. Herod, who had personally advised Antony after the Battle of Actium that he should betray Cleopatra, traveled to Rhodes to meet Octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to Antony. Octavian was impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty, so he allowed him to maintain his position in Judea, further isolating Antony and Cleopatra.\nCleopatra perhaps started to view Antony as a liability by the late summer of 31 BC, when she prepared to leave Egypt to her son Caesarion. Cleopatra planned to relinquish her throne to him, take her fleet from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea, and then set sail to a foreign port, perhaps in India, where she could spend time recuperating. However, these plans were ultimately abandoned when Malichus I, as advised by Octavian's governor of Syria, Quintus Didius, managed to burn Cleopatra's fleet in revenge for his losses in a war with Herod that Cleopatra had largely initiated. Cleopatra had no other option but to stay in Egypt and negotiate with Octavian. Although most likely later pro-Octavian propaganda, it was reported that at this time Cleopatra started testing the strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants.\n\nCleopatra had Caesarion enter into the ranks of the ephebi, which, along with reliefs on a stele from Koptos dated 21 September 31 BC, demonstrated that Cleopatra was now grooming her son to become the sole ruler of Egypt. In a show of solidarity, Antony also had Marcus Antonius Antyllus, his son with Fulvia, enter the ephebi at the same time. Separate messages and envoys from Antony and Cleopatra were then sent to Octavian, still stationed at Rhodes, although Octavian seems to have replied only to Cleopatra. Cleopatra requested that her children should inherit Egypt and that Antony should be allowed to live in exile in Egypt, offered Octavian money in the future, and immediately sent him lavish gifts. Octavian sent his diplomat Thyrsos to Cleopatra after she threatened to burn herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction. Thyrsos advised her to kill Antony so that her life would be spared, but when Antony suspected foul intent, he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to Octavian without a deal.\nAfter lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results, Octavian set out to invade Egypt in the spring of 30 BC, stopping at Ptolemais in Phoenicia, where his new ally Herod provided his army with fresh supplies. Octavian moved south and swiftly took Pelousion, while Cornelius Gallus, marching eastward from Cyrene, defeated Antony's forces near Paraitonion. Octavian advanced quickly to Alexandria, but Antony returned and won a small victory over Octavian's tired troops outside the city's hippodrome. However, on 1 August 30 BC, Antony's naval fleet surrendered to Octavian, followed by Antony's cavalry.\nCleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants and sent a message to Antony that she had committed suicide. In despair, Antony responded to this by stabbing himself in the stomach and taking his own life at age 53. According to Plutarch, he was still dying when brought to Cleopatra at her tomb, telling her he had died honorably and that she could trust Octavian's companion Gaius Proculeius over anyone else in his entourage. It was Proculeius, however, who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained the queen, denying her the ability to burn herself with her treasures. Cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury Antony within her tomb before she was escorted to the palace.\n\nOctavian entered Alexandria, occupied the palace, and seized Cleopatra's three youngest children. When she met with Octavian, Cleopatra told him bluntly, \"I will not be led in a triumph\" (Ancient Greek: οὑ θριαμβεύσομαι, romanized: ou thriambéusomai), according to Livy, a rare recording of her exact words. Octavian promised that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom. When a spy informed her that Octavian planned to move her and her children to Rome in three days, she prepared for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV. It is unclear if Cleopatra's suicide on 12 August 30 BC, at age 39, took place within the palace or her tomb. It is said she was accompanied by her servants Eiras and Charmion, who also took their own lives.\nOctavian was said to have been angered by this outcome but had Cleopatra buried in royal fashion next to Antony in her tomb. Cleopatra's physician, Olympos, did not explain her cause of death, although the popular belief is that she allowed an asp or Egyptian cobra to bite and poison her. Plutarch relates this tale, but then suggests an implement (κνῆστις, knêstis, lit. 'spine, cheese-grater') was used to introduce the toxin by scratching,; Dio says that she injected the poison with a needle (βελόνη, belónē), and Strabo argued for an ointment of some kind. Horace corroborates the common belief that it was a venomous snake, but instead states that it was several (serpentēs, lit.'serpents'). Vergil agrees that it was several serpents. Both this and Horace's account suggest that this belief stemmed from Octavian's propaganda. No venomous snake was found with her body, but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle.\nCleopatra decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt, perhaps with plans to flee to Kushite Nubia, Ethiopia, or India. Caesarion, now Ptolemy XV, would live for a mere 18 days until executed on the orders of Octavian around 29 August 30 BC, after returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king. Octavian was convinced by the advice of the philosopher Arius Didymus that there was room for only one Caesar in the world. With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Roman province of Egypt was established, marking the end of the Hellenistic period. In January of 27 BC Octavian was renamed Augustus (\"the revered\") and amassed constitutional powers that established him as the first Roman emperor, inaugurating the Principate era of the Roman Empire.\n\n\n== Cleopatra's kingdom and role as a monarch ==\n\nFollowing the tradition of Macedonian rulers, Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an absolute monarch, serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom. She was the chief religious authority in her realm, presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the Egyptian and Greek polytheistic faiths. She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods, a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt, and even built the Caesareum of Alexandria, dedicated to the cult worship of her patron and lover Julius Caesar.\nCleopatra was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her domain, tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to the starving populace during a drought at the beginning of her reign. A study suggested that volcanic eruptions caused the unfavourable climate and that this contributed to Cleopatra's demise, although others expressed skepticism about this hypothesis. Although the command economy that she managed was more of an ideal than a reality, the government attempted to impose price controls, tariffs, and state monopolies for certain goods, fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies, and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons. Apparent financial troubles led Cleopatra to debase her coinage, which included silver and bronze currencies but no gold coins like those of some of her distant Ptolemaic predecessors.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Children and successors ===\n\nAfter her suicide, Cleopatra's three surviving children, Cleopatra Selene II, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus, were sent to Rome with Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a former wife of their father, as their guardian. Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC. The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point. Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II, son of Juba I, whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba I's support of Pompey.\nThe emperor Augustus installed Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II, after their wedding in 25 BC, as the new rulers of Mauretania, where they transformed the old Carthaginian city of Iol into their new capital, renamed Caesarea Mauretaniae (modern Cherchell, Algeria). Cleopatra Selene II imported many important scholars, artists, and advisers from her mother's royal court in Alexandria to serve her in Caesarea, now permeated in Hellenistic Greek culture. She also named her son Ptolemy of Mauretania, in honor of their Ptolemaic dynastic heritage.\nCleopatra Selene II died c. 5 BC, and when Juba II died in 23/24 AD he was succeeded by his son Ptolemy. However, Ptolemy was eventually executed by the Roman emperor Caligula in 40 AD, perhaps under the pretense that Ptolemy had unlawfully minted his own royal coinage and utilized regalia reserved for the Roman emperor. Ptolemy of Mauretania was the last known monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty, although Queen Zenobia, of the short-lived Palmyrene Empire during the Crisis of the Third Century, claimed descent from Cleopatra. A cult dedicated to Cleopatra still existed as late as 373 AD when Petesenufe, an Egyptian scribe of the book of Isis, explained that he \"overlaid the figure of Cleopatra with gold.\"\n\n\n=== Roman literature and historiography ===\n\nAlthough almost 50 ancient works of Roman historiography mention Cleopatra, these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium, her suicide, and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies. Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra, the Life of Antonius written by Plutarch in the 1st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatra's life. Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on primary sources, such as Philotas of Amphissa, who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace, Cleopatra's personal physician named Olympos, and Quintus Dellius, a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Plutarch's work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatra—which became canonical for his period—as well as sources outside of this tradition, such as eyewitness reports.\nThe Jewish Roman historian Josephus, writing in the 1st century AD, provides valuable information on the life of Cleopatra via her diplomatic relationship with Herod the Great. However, this work relies largely on Herod's memoirs and the biased account of Nicolaus of Damascus, the tutor of Cleopatra's children in Alexandria before he moved to Judea to serve as an adviser and chronicler at Herod's court. The Roman History published by the official and historian Cassius Dio in the early 3rd century AD, while failing to fully comprehend the complexities of the late Hellenistic world, nevertheless provides a continuous history of the era of Cleopatra's reign.\n\nCleopatra is barely mentioned in De Bello Alexandrino, the memoirs of an unknown staff officer who served under Caesar. The writings of Cicero, who knew her personally, provide an unflattering portrait of Cleopatra. The Augustan-period authors Virgil, Horace, Propertius, and Ovid perpetuated the negative views of Cleopatra approved by the ruling Roman regime, although Virgil established the idea of Cleopatra as a figure of romance and epic melodrama. Horace also viewed Cleopatra's suicide as a positive choice, an idea that found acceptance by the Late Middle Ages with Geoffrey Chaucer.\nThe historians Strabo, Velleius, Valerius Maximus, Pliny the Elder, and Appian, while not offering accounts as full as Plutarch, Josephus, or Dio, provided some details of her life that had not survived in other historical records. Inscriptions on contemporary Ptolemaic coinage and some Egyptian papyrus documents demonstrate Cleopatra's point of view, but this material is very limited in comparison to Roman literary works. The fragmentary Libyka commissioned by Cleopatra's son-in-law Juba II provides a glimpse at a possible body of historiographic material that supported Cleopatra's perspective.\nCleopatra's gender has perhaps led to her depiction as a minor if not insignificant figure in ancient, medieval, and even modern historiography about ancient Egypt and the Greco-Roman world. For instance, the historian Ronald Syme asserted that she was of little importance to Caesar and that the propaganda of Octavian magnified her importance to an excessive degree. Although the common view of Cleopatra was one of a prolific seductress, she had only two known sexual partners, Caesar and Antony, the two most prominent Romans of the time period, who were most likely to ensure the survival of her dynasty. Plutarch described Cleopatra as having had a stronger personality and charming wit than physical beauty.\n\n\n=== Cultural depictions ===\n\n\n==== Depictions in ancient art ====\n\n\n===== Statues =====\n\nCleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art, in the Egyptian as well as Hellenistic-Greek and Roman styles. Surviving works include statues, busts, reliefs, and minted coins, as well as ancient carved cameos, such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style, now in the Altes Museum, Berlin. Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt. For instance, there was once a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome, the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a Roman temple. It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 3rd century AD, its preservation perhaps owing to Caesar's patronage, although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra.\nA life-sized Roman-style statue of Cleopatra was found near the Tomba di Nerone, Rome, along the Via Cassia, and is now housed in the Museo Pio-Clementino, part of the Vatican Museums. Plutarch, in his Life of Antonius, said that the public statues of Antony were torn down by Augustus, but those of Cleopatra were preserved following her death thanks to her friend Archibius paying the emperor 2,000 talents to dissuade him from destroying hers.\nSince the 1950s scholars have debated whether or not the Esquiline Venus—discovered in 1874 on the Esquiline Hill in Rome and housed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori of the Capitoline Museums—is a depiction of Cleopatra, based on the statue's hairstyle and facial features, apparent royal diadem worn over the head, and the uraeus Egyptian cobra wrapped around the base. Detractors of this theory argue that the face in this statue is thinner than the face on the Berlin portrait and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as the naked goddess Venus (or the Greek Aphrodite). However, she was depicted in an Egyptian statue as the goddess Isis, while some of her coinage depicts her as Venus-Aphrodite. She also dressed as Aphrodite when meeting Antony at Tarsos. The Esquiline Venus is generally thought to be a mid-1st-century AD Roman copy of a 1st-century BC Greek original from the school of Pasiteles.\n\n\n===== Coinage portraits =====\n\nSurviving coinage of Cleopatra's reign include specimens from every regnal year, from 51 to 30 BC. Cleopatra, the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf, almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins. Cleopatra was the first foreign queen to have her image appear on Roman currency. Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony, which also bear his image, portray the queen as having a very similar aquiline nose and prominent chin as that of her husband. These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutually-observed harmony of a royal couple.\n\nHer strong, almost masculine facial features in these particular coins are strikingly different from the smoother, softer, and perhaps idealized sculpted images of her in either the Egyptian or Hellenistic styles. Her masculine facial features on minted currency are similar to that of her father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, and perhaps also to those of her Ptolemaic ancestor Arsinoe II (316–260 BC) and even depictions of earlier queens such as Hatshepsut and Nefertiti. It is likely, due to political expediency, that Antony's visage was made to conform not only to hers but also to those of her Macedonian Greek ancestors who founded the Ptolemaic dynasty, to familiarize himself to her subjects as a legitimate member of the royal house.The inscriptions on the coins are written in Greek, but also in the nominative case of Roman coins rather than the genitive case of Greek coins, in addition to having the letters placed in a circular fashion along the edges of the coin instead of across it horizontally or vertically as was customary for Greek ones. These facets of their coinage represent the synthesis of Roman and Hellenistic culture, and perhaps also a statement to their subjects, however ambiguous to modern scholars, about the superiority of either Antony or Cleopatra over the other. Diana Kleiner argues that Cleopatra, in one of her coins minted with the dual image of her husband Antony, made herself more masculine-looking than other portraits and more like an acceptable Roman client queen than a Hellenistic ruler. Cleopatra had actually achieved this masculine look in coinage predating her affair with Antony, such as the coins struck at the Ascalon mint during her brief period of exile to Syria and the Levant, which Joann Fletcher explains as her attempt to appear like her father and as a legitimate successor to a male Ptolemaic ruler.\nVarious coins, such as a silver tetradrachm minted sometime after Cleopatra's marriage with Antony in 37 BC, depict her wearing a royal diadem and a 'melon' hairstyle. The combination of this hairstyle with a diadem is also featured in two surviving sculpted marble heads. This hairstyle, with hair braided back into a bun, is the same as that worn by her Ptolemaic ancestors Arsinoe II and Berenice II in their own coinage. After her visit to Rome in 46–44 BC it became fashionable for Roman women to adopt it as one of their hairstyles, but it was abandoned for a more modest, austere look during the conservative rule of Augustus.\n\n\n===== Greco-Roman busts and heads =====\n\nOf the surviving Greco-Roman-style busts and heads of Cleopatra, the sculpture known as the \"Berlin Cleopatra\", located in the Antikensammlung Berlin collection at the Altes Museum, possesses her full nose, whereas the head known as the \"Vatican Cleopatra\", located in the Vatican Museums, is damaged with a missing nose. Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems, similar facial features, and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix.\nBoth heads are dated to the mid-1st century BC and were found in Roman villas along the Via Appia in Italy, the Vatican Cleopatra having been unearthed in the Villa of the Quintilii. Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the Berlin head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun, a diadem, and a hooked nose.\nA third sculpted portrait of Cleopatra accepted by scholars as being authentic survives at the Archaeological Museum of Cherchell, Algeria. This portrait features the royal diadem and similar facial features as the Berlin and Vatican heads, but has a more unique hairstyle and may actually depict Cleopatra Selene II, daughter of Cleopatra. A possible Parian-marble sculpture of Cleopatra wearing a vulture headdress in Egyptian style is located at the Capitoline Museums. Discovered near a sanctuary of Isis in Rome and dated to the 1st century BC, it is either Roman or Hellenistic-Egyptian in origin.\nOther possible sculpted depictions of Cleopatra include one in the British Museum, London, made of limestone, which perhaps only depicts a woman in her entourage during her trip to Rome. The woman in this portrait has facial features similar to others (including the pronounced aquiline nose), but lacks a royal diadem and sports a different hairstyle. However, the British Museum head, once belonging to a full statue, could potentially represent Cleopatra at a different stage in her life and may also betray an effort by Cleopatra to discard the use of royal insignia (i.e. the diadem) to make herself more appealing to the citizens of Republican Rome. Duane W. Roller speculates that the British Museum head, along with those in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, the Capitoline Museums, and in the private collection of Maurice Nahmen, while having similar facial features and hairstyles as the Berlin portrait but lacking a royal diadem, most likely represent members of the royal court or even Roman women imitating Cleopatra's popular hairstyle.\n\n\n===== Paintings =====\n\nIn the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, Italy, a mid-1st century BC Second Style wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a cupid near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion. The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar in September 46 BC, where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra. This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as this painting at Pompeii.\nThe woman in the painting wears a royal diadem over her head and is strikingly similar in appearance to the Vatican Cleopatra, which bears possible marks on the marble of its left cheek where a cupid's arm may have been torn off. The room with the painting was walled off by its owner, perhaps in reaction to the execution of Caesarion in 30 BC by order of Octavian, when public depictions of Cleopatra's son would have been unfavorable with the new Roman regime.\nBehind her golden diadem, crowned with a red jewel, is a translucent veil with crinkles that suggest the \"melon\" hairstyle favored by the queen. Her ivory-white skin, round face, long aquiline nose, and large round eyes were features common in both Roman and Ptolemaic depictions of deities. Roller affirms that \"there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of Cleopatra and Caesarion before the doors of the Temple of Venus in the Forum Julium and, as such, it becomes the only extant contemporary painting of the queen.\"\n\nAnother painting from Pompeii, dated to the early 1st century AD and located in the House of Giuseppe II, contains a possible depiction of Cleopatra with her son Caesarion, both wearing royal diadems while she reclines and consumes poison in an act of suicide. The painting was originally thought to depict the Carthaginian noblewoman Sophonisba, who toward the end of the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) drank poison and committed suicide at the behest of her lover Masinissa, King of Numidia. Arguments in favor of it depicting Cleopatra include the strong connection of her house with that of the Numidian royal family, Masinissa and Ptolemy VIII Physcon having been associates, and Cleopatra's own daughter marrying the Numidian prince Juba II.\nSophonisba was also a more obscure figure when the painting was made, while Cleopatra's suicide was far more famous. An asp is absent from the painting, but many Romans held the view that she received poison in another manner than a venomous snakebite. A set of double doors on the rear wall of the painting, positioned very high above the people in it, suggests the described layout of Cleopatra's tomb in Alexandria. A male servant holds the mouth of an artificial Egyptian crocodile (possibly an elaborate tray handle), while another man standing by is dressed as a Roman.\nIn 1818 a now lost encaustic painting was discovered in the Temple of Serapis at Hadrian's Villa, near Tivoli, Lazio, Italy, that depicted Cleopatra committing suicide with an asp biting her bare chest. A chemical analysis performed in 1822 confirmed that the medium for the painting was composed of one-third wax and two-thirds resin. The thickness of the painting over Cleopatra's bare flesh and her drapery were reportedly similar to the paintings of the Fayum mummy portraits. A steel engraving published by John Sartain in 1885 depicting the painting as described in the archaeological report shows Cleopatra wearing authentic clothing and jewelry of Egypt in the late Hellenistic period, as well as the radiant crown of the Ptolemaic rulers, as seen in their portraits on various coins minted during their respective reigns. After Cleopatra's suicide, Octavian commissioned a painting to be made depicting her being bitten by a snake, parading this image in her stead during his triumphal procession in Rome. The portrait painting of Cleopatra's death was perhaps among the great number of artworks and treasures taken from Rome by Emperor Hadrian to decorate his private villa, where it was found in an Egyptian temple.\n\nA Roman panel painting from Herculaneum, Italy, dated to the 1st century AD possibly depicts Cleopatra. In it she wears a royal diadem, red or reddish-brown hair pulled back into a bun, pearl-studded hairpins, and earrings with ball-shaped pendants, the white skin of her face and neck set against a stark black background. Her hair and facial features are similar to those in the sculpted Berlin and Vatican portraits as well as her coinage. A highly similar painted bust of a woman with a blue headband in the House of the Orchard at Pompeii features Egyptian-style imagery, such as a Greek-style sphinx, and may have been created by the same artist.\n\n\n===== Portland Vase =====\n\nThe Portland Vase, a Roman cameo glass vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum, includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony. In this interpretation, Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent (i.e. the asp) rises between her legs, Eros floats above, and Anton, the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family, looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom. The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia, abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother, the emperor Augustus. The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC, when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria.\n\n\n===== Native Egyptian art =====\n\nThe Bust of Cleopatra in the Royal Ontario Museum represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style. Dated to the mid-1st century BC, it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt. The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art. The Dendera Temple complex, near Dendera, Egypt, contains Egyptian-style carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of Hathor depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making offerings to the gods. Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra.\nA large Ptolemaic black basalt statue measuring 104 centimetres (41 in) in height, now in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, is thought to represent Arsinoe II, wife of Ptolemy II, but recent analysis has indicated that it could depict her descendant Cleopatra due to the three uraei adorning her headdress, an increase from the two used by Arsinoe II to symbolize her rule over Lower and Upper Egypt. The woman in the basalt statue also holds a divided, double cornucopia (dikeras), which can be seen on coins of both Arsinoe II and Cleopatra. In his Kleopatra und die Caesaren (2006), Bernard Andreae contends that this basalt statue, like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen, does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of her appearance. Adrian Goldsworthy writes that, despite these representations in the traditional Egyptian style, Cleopatra would have dressed as a native only \"perhaps for certain rites\" and instead would usually dress as a Greek monarch, which would include the Greek headband seen in her Greco-Roman busts.\n\n\n==== Medieval and Early Modern reception ====\n\nIn modern times Cleopatra has become an icon of popular culture, a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to the Renaissance as well as paintings and films. This material largely surpasses the scope and size of existent historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on the general public's view of Cleopatra than the latter. The 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer, in The Legend of Good Women, contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the Middle Ages. His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony, her shining knight engaged in courtly love, has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire.\nChaucer highlighted Cleopatra's relationships with only two men as hardly the life of a seductress and wrote his works partly in reaction to the negative depiction of Cleopatra in De Mulieribus Claris and De Casibus Virorum Illustrium, Latin works by the 14th-century Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio. The Renaissance humanist Bernardino Cacciante, in his 1504 Libretto apologetico delle donne, was the first Italian to defend the reputation of Cleopatra and criticize the perceived moralizing and misogyny in Boccaccio's works. Works of Islamic historiography written in Arabic covered the reign of Cleopatra, such as the 10th-century Meadows of Gold by Al-Masudi, although his work erroneously claimed that Octavian died soon after Cleopatra's suicide.\nCleopatra appeared in miniatures for illuminated manuscripts, such as a depiction of her and Antony lying in a Gothic-style tomb by the Boucicaut Master in 1409. In the visual arts, the sculpted depiction of Cleopatra as a free-standing nude figure committing suicide began with the 16th-century sculptors Bartolommeo Bandinelli and Alessandro Vittoria. Early prints depicting Cleopatra include designs by the Renaissance artists Raphael and Michelangelo, as well as 15th-century woodcuts in illustrated editions of Boccaccio's works.\nIn the performing arts, the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603, and the German publication in 1606 of alleged letters of Cleopatra, inspired Samuel Daniel to alter and republish his 1594 play Cleopatra in 1607. He was followed by William Shakespeare, whose Antony and Cleopatra, largely based on Plutarch, was first performed in 1608 and provided a somewhat salacious view of Cleopatra in stark contrast to England's own Virgin Queen. Cleopatra was also featured in operas, such as George Frideric Handel's 1724 Giulio Cesare in Egitto, which portrayed the love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra; Domenico Cimarosa wrote Cleopatra on a similar subject in 1789.\n\n\n==== Modern depictions and brand imaging ====\n\nIn Victorian Britain, Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture and her image was used to market various household products, including oil lamps, lithographs, postcards and cigarettes. Fictional novels such as H. Rider Haggard's Cleopatra (1889) and Théophile Gautier's One of Cleopatra's Nights (1838) depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner, while the Egyptologist Georg Ebers's Cleopatra (1894) was more grounded in historical accuracy. The French dramatist Victorien Sardou and Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw produced plays about Cleopatra, while burlesque shows such as F. C. Burnand's Antony and Cleopatra offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age.\nShakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra was considered canonical by the Victorian era. Its popularity led to the perception that the 1885 painting by Lawrence Alma-Tadema depicted the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra on her pleasure barge in Tarsus, although Alma-Tadema revealed in a private letter that it depicts a subsequent meeting of theirs in Alexandria. Also based on Shakespeare's play was Samuel Barber's opera Antony and Cleopatra (1966), commissioned for the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House. In his unfinished 1825 short story The Egyptian Nights, Alexander Pushkin popularized the claims of the 4th-century Roman historian Aurelius Victor, previously largely ignored, that Cleopatra had prostituted herself to men who paid for sex with their lives. Cleopatra also became appreciated outside the Western world and Middle East, as the Qing-dynasty Chinese scholar Yan Fu wrote an extensive biography of her.\nGeorges Méliès's Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb (French: Cléopâtre), an 1899 French silent horror film, was the first film to depict the character of Cleopatra. Hollywood films of the 20th century were influenced by earlier Victorian media, which helped to shape the character of Cleopatra played by Theda Bara in Cleopatra (1917), Claudette Colbert in Cleopatra (1934), and Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra (1963). In addition to her portrayal as a \"vampire\" queen, Bara's Cleopatra also incorporated tropes familiar from 19th-century Orientalist painting, such as despotic behavior, mixed with dangerous and overt female sexuality. Colbert's character of Cleopatra served as a glamour model for selling Egyptian-themed products in department stores in the 1930s, targeting female moviegoers. In preparation for the film starring Taylor as Cleopatra, women's magazines of the early 1960s advertised how to use makeup, clothes, jewelry, and hairstyles to achieve the \"Egyptian\" look similar to the queens Cleopatra and Nefertiti. By the end of the 20th century there were forty-three films, two hundred plays and novels, forty-five operas, and five ballets associated with Cleopatra.\n\n\n=== Written works ===\n\nWhereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media, important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed, such as her command of naval forces and administrative acts. Publications on ancient Greek medicine attributed to her are, likely to be the work of a physician by the same name writing in the late first century AD. Ingrid D. Rowland, who highlights that the \"Berenice called Cleopatra\" cited by the 3rd- or 4th-century female Roman physician Metrodora was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra. Only fragments exist of these medical and cosmetic writings, such as those preserved by Galen, including remedies for hair disease, baldness, and dandruff, along with a list of weights and measures for pharmacological purposes. Aëtius of Amida attributed a recipe for perfumed soap to Cleopatra, while Paul of Aegina preserved alleged instructions of hers for dyeing and curling hair.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\nCleopatra belonged to the Macedonian Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies, their European origins tracing back to northern Greece. Through her father, she was a descendant of two prominent companions of Alexander the Great of Macedon: the general Ptolemy I Soter, founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, and Seleucus I Nicator, the Macedonian Greek founder of the Seleucid Empire of West Asia. While Cleopatra's paternal line can be traced, the identity of her mother is uncertain. She was presumably the daughter of Cleopatra V Tryphaena, the sister-wife of Ptolemy XII who had previously given birth to their daughter Berenice IV.\nCleopatra I Syra was the only member of the Ptolemaic dynasty known for certain to have introduced some non-Greek ancestry. Her mother Laodice III was a daughter born to King Mithridates II of Pontus, a Persian of the Mithridatic dynasty, and his wife Laodice who had a mixed Greek-Persian heritage. Cleopatra I Syra's father Antiochus III the Great was a descendant of Queen Apama, the Sogdian Iranian wife of Seleucus I Nicator. It is generally believed that the Ptolemies did not intermarry with native Egyptians. Michael Grant asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy, further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and \"would have described herself as Greek\".\nStacy Schiff writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry, arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress. Duane W. Roller speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian-Greek, half-Egyptian woman from Memphis in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to Ptah (a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarship), but contends that whatever Cleopatra's ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most. Ernle Bradford writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman \"but as a civilized Greek\".\nClaims that Cleopatra was an illegitimate child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her. Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XII's children born after Berenice IV, including Cleopatra, were illegitimate. Cleopatra V (or VI) was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC, a few months after the birth of Cleopatra, while Ptolemy XII's three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife. The high degree of inbreeding among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatra's immediate ancestry, of which a reconstruction is shown below.\nThe family tree given below also lists Cleopatra V as a daughter of Ptolemy X Alexander I and Berenice III. This would make her a cousin of her husband, Ptolemy XII, but she could have been a daughter of Ptolemy IX Lathyros, which would have made her a sister-wife of Ptolemy XII instead. The confused accounts in ancient primary sources have also led scholars to number Ptolemy XII's wife as either Cleopatra V or Cleopatra VI; the latter may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII. Fletcher and John Whitehorne assert that this is a possible indication Cleopatra V had died in 69 BC rather than reappearing as a co-ruler with Berenice IV in 58 BC (during Ptolemy XII's exile in Rome).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of female hereditary monarchs\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n==== Online ====\n\n\n==== Print ====\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAncient Roman depictions of Cleopatra VII of Egypt, at YouTube\nCleopatra on In Our Time at the BBC\nJacob Abbott (1852).

        "title": "Pamela Anderson",
        "content": "Pamela Denise Anderson (born July 1, 1967) is a Canadian-American actress, model and media personality. She rose to prominence after being selected as the February 1990 Playboy Playmate of the Month. She went on to obtain the record for the most Playboy cover appearances. Anderson began her acting career on the ABC sitcom Home Improvement (1991–1993, 1997), before receiving international recognition for starring as \"C.J.\" Parker in the drama series Baywatch (1992–1997), which cemented her status as a sex symbol. In 1995, home videos of Anderson with her then-husband, Tommy Lee, were stolen, spliced together, and sold as a sex tape, which resulted in a legal fight and made her the subject of controversy. \nAnderson starred as Vallery Irons in the syndicated series V.I.P. (1998–2002) and as Skyler Dayton in the Fox sitcom Stacked (2005–2006). Her film credits include Barb Wire (1996), Scary Movie 3 (2003), Borat (2006), Baywatch (2017), and City Hunter (2018). She starred in the reality series Pam: Girl on the Loose (2008) and appeared as a contestant on the Dancing with the Stars franchise (2010–2012, 2018). She saw a career resurgence in the 2020s after her Broadway debut as Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago (2022) and the 2023 releases of the Netflix documentary Pamela, a Love Story and her autobiography, Love, Pamela. For starring in the independent drama film The Last Showgirl (2024), she received nominations for the Golden Globe Award and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. She then starred in the comedy film The Naked Gun (2025).\nAnderson has supported various charitable causes, particularly animal rights and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and endorses plant-based cooking. She hosts Flavour Network's plant-based cooking show Pamela's Cooking with Love (2025–present), and released a plant-based cookbook I Love You: Recipes from the Heart, which was nominated for a 2025 James Beard Award, for the work of her photographer, Ditte Isager.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAnderson was born in Ladysmith, British Columbia, Canada, the daughter of Barry W. Anderson, a furnace repairman, and Carol (née Cawthorpe), a waitress. Her great-grandfather, Juho Hyytiäinen, was a Finnish native of Saarijärvi, and left the Grand Duchy of Finland (which was an autonomous state within the Russian Empire at the time) for Canada in 1908. He changed his name to Anderson when he arrived as an immigrant. Anderson also has Volga German ancestry on her mother's side; her grandmother, Rose Friesen, ethnically German, was born in Russia in a Mennonite village and immigrated to Canada in 1901. Anderson received press coverage right after her birth as a \"Centennial Baby\", having been born on July 1, 1967, the 100th anniversary of Canada's official founding via the Constitution Act, 1867. She has a younger brother, Gerry (born 1971), an actor and producer who worked in some of her films and television shows.\nWhen she was in grade 8, Anderson was a \"scat soloist\" for her middle school jazz band, where she played the saxophone. Decades later, she would draw on this talent for a solo in The Naked Gun. Anderson attended Highland Secondary School in Comox, British Columbia. In high school, she played on the volleyball team, and graduated in 1985. \nIn 2014, Anderson discussed suffering sexual abuse as a child. She mentioned being molested by a female babysitter from ages 6 to 10, raped by a 25-year-old man when she was age 12, and gang-raped by her boyfriend and six of his friends when she was 14.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1988–1999: Modelling and acting breakthrough ===\nIn 1988, Anderson moved to Vancouver and worked as a fitness instructor. The next year, she attended a BC Lions Canadian Football League game at the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, where she was featured on the jumbotron while wearing a Labatt's Beer T-shirt. The brewing company hired Anderson briefly as a spokesmodel. Inspired by the event, her then-boyfriend Dan Ilicic produced a poster of her image, entitled the Blue Zone Girl.\n\nAnderson was flown to Los Angeles for a photo shoot; she appeared as the cover girl on Playboy magazine's October 1989 issue. She subsequently moved to the United States, settling in LA to further pursue a modelling career. Playboy subsequently chose her as Playmate of the Month in their February 1990 issue, in which she appeared in the centrefold portrait. Anderson then elected to have breast implant surgery, increasing her bust size to 34D. She increased her bust size again, to 34DD, several years later. Her Playboy career spans 22 years, and she has appeared on more Playboy covers than any other model. She has also made numerous appearances in the publication's newsstand specials. Anderson wrote the foreword to the Playboy coffee table book Playboy's Greatest Covers. After Anderson moved to Los Angeles, she won a minor role as Lisa, the original \"Tool Time Girl\", on the ABC comedy series Home Improvement.\nHer breakthrough role was as C.J. Parker on Baywatch, which she played for five seasons between 1992 and 1997, making her one of the longest-serving cast members. The series has gained her popularity from international viewers and the character of Parker became one of her best-known roles, having been reenacted by multiple high-profile people since. Anderson was paid US$1,500 per episode during the first season. She reprised her role in a reunion movie, Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding (2003), and also appeared in commercials for DirecTV in 2007. Anderson was still modelling for Outdoor Life and appearing on the cover of the magazine each year. In 1993, Anderson appeared in a music video \"Can't Have Your Cake\" by Vince Neil to promote his first solo album, Exposed.\nIn 1994, she was cast in her first starring film role, in Raw Justice, also known as Good Cop, Bad Cop, co-starring with Stacy Keach, David Keith, and Robert Hays. Under the alternate title, the film won the Bronze Award at the Worldfest-Charleston in the category for dramatic theatrical films. In 1996, she played Barbara Rose Kopetski in the film Barb Wire. The movie, a thinly veiled futuristic remake of Casablanca, was not a commercial success. During filming, she had barbed wire tattooed on her left upper arm instead of having it painted on by make-up artists every day, but she had it removed in 2016. In April 1997, she guest-hosted Saturday Night Live. She appeared on one of two covers for the September issue of Playboy. In September 1998, Anderson starred as Vallery Irons in the Sony Pictures Television syndicated action/comedy-drama series V.I.P. created by J. F. Lawton. The series had a successful four-year run.

She appeared on The Nanny as Fran Fine's rival, Heather Biblow.\n\n\n=== 2000–2009: Rise to media prominence ===\nSam Newman House, a pop architecture building constructed in 2001 in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia, has a large image of Anderson's face. Sam Newman commissioned local architect Cassandra Fahey to design the building, and used the image with Anderson's permission. Permits were issued retroactively when it became a major local landmark and won the award for Best New Residential Building in the RAIA Victorian Architecture Awards. Later that year, Anderson played herself in the Miller Lite TV commercial \"Pillow Fight\", the sequel to the brand's earlier commercial \"Catfight\", with models Tanya Ballinger and Kitana Baker reprising their roles.\nIn May 2004, Anderson appeared nude on the cover of Playboy magazine.

In 2005, Anderson starred in a new Fox comedy series Stacked as Skyler Dayton, a party girl who works at a book store. It was cancelled on May 18, 2006, after two seasons. On August 14, 2005, Comedy Central aired the Roast of Pamela Anderson.\n\nIn December 2005, NBC cut a video of Anderson pole dancing to Elton John's \"The Red Piano\", saying that the footage was inappropriate for prime time. The video was shown on huge screens during the event, while John played \"The Bitch is Back\". \nIn March 2006, Anderson received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. In April 2006, she hosted Canada's Juno Awards, becoming the first non-singer and model to do so. She also appeared in the 2006 mockumentary Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, in which the title character becomes obsessed with her and plans to abduct and marry her. She appears as herself at a book-signing at the end of the film, confronted by Borat in a staged botched abduction.\nAnderson performed on February 13–14, 2008, in a Valentine's Day strip-tease act at the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris. Anderson then starred in the reality series Pam: Girl on the Loose.\nIn December 2009, Anderson guest-starred as Genie of the Lamp in the pantomime Aladdin at the New Wimbledon Theatre in Wimbledon, in southwest London. Anderson took over the role from comedian Ruby Wax, with former EastEnders actress Anita Dobson and comedian Paul O'Grady also booked for the role.\n\n\n=== 2010–2021: Shift to reality television ===\nIn 2010, she appeared in the short film The Commuter directed by the McHenry Brothers and shot entirely on the Nokia N8 smartphone as promotion for the phone in the UK. Anderson was featured in a beach-themed editorial, shot by Mario Testino for Brazilian Vogue's June 2013 \"Body Issue\".\nIn November 2010, Anderson appeared on season 4 of Bigg Boss, the Indian version of the Big Brother television franchise. She stayed as a guest in the house for three days for a reported sum of Rs. 2.5 crores (approx US$550,000). Furthering her involvement in the franchise, Anderson took part in the 12th season of Big Brother in the United Kingdom in 2011. In 2012, she appeared as a Special Houseguest on the fourth season of VIP Brother, the celebrity spin-off of Big Brother in Bulgaria.\nOn Day 12 of the first season of  Promi Big Brother in Germany, she entered the house, as a Special Guest Star on the final day. David Hasselhoff, a former Baywatch co-star, was a contestant on Days 1 to 5.\nAnderson was a contestant on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars, partnered with professional dancer Damian Whitewood. The season premiered on March 22, 2010. Anderson was eliminated after seven weeks. She also took part in the 15th season all-star edition in 2012 with Tristan MacManus. Anderson and MacManus were eliminated in the first week of competition.\nIn May 2011, she was a contestant on the Bailando 2011 (Argentina), partnered with professional dancer Damian Whitewood.

The season premiered on September 29, 2018. Anderson was eliminated on November 8, 2018.\n\n\n=== 2022–present: Return to acting and critical acclaim ===\nAnderson made her Broadway debut playing Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of Chicago for eight weeks from April 12, 2022 to June 5, 2022 (her first time performing since 2019). A few months later in 2023, Netflix released a documentary directed by Ryan White on her life from childhood to the 2022 appearance in Chicago, called Pamela, a Love Story. It was also produced by her son Brandon Thomas Lee, who received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination as a producer in the 2023 Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special category for his work on the film. Its release coincided with Anderson's autobiography, Love, Pamela, which debuted at number two on The New York Times Best Seller list within its first week of release.\n\nAfter watching Pamela, a Love Story, Gia Coppola wanted to cast Anderson as Shelly in the 2024 drama film The Last Showgirl. She sent the script to Anderson's then-agent who turned it down within the hour without letting Anderson know about it. Coppola then reached out to Anderson's son Brandon through mutual friends, who passed it along to his mother. While Anderson had given up on acting by this point, she accepted the role. She was officially cast in February 2024, starring alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, Dave Bautista, Brenda Song, Kiernan Shipka and Billie Lourd. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2024, with Anderson calling it \"the role I have been waiting for my entire career\". Caryn James of the BBC called Anderson \"a revelation\" and wrote: \"The low-key devastation Anderson has captured is the real acting triumph.\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said Anderson's \"transformative performance is undeniably affecting, offering illuminating insights into both the character and the actress playing her, who has had to struggle to be taken seriously. This role should mark a turning point on that front.\" Anderson received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance in the film, marking her first Golden Globe Award nomination and the first major industry acting nomination in her career. She was also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.\nAnderson appeared in the November 12, 2024 episode of the Criterion Closet, where she discussed her lifelong interest in cinema. The films she selected included Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, David Lynch's Blue Velvet, Federico Fellini's La Strada, and David Lean's Summertime.\nIn 2025, Anderson appeared in the Williamstown Theatre Festival's production of Camino Real (Tennessee Williams), and co-starred in the 2025 action comedy The Naked Gun with Liam Neeson. She is slated to appear in Karim Aïnouz's Rosebush Pruning.\n\n\n=== Plant-based cooking ===\nAnderson became a vegetarian in her early teens after her father went hunting and brought home a \"bloodied deer.\" She eventually transitioned to a vegan diet in her twenties, and promotes the benefits of a plant-based diet. She served as an executive producer for the 2018 plant-based documentary, The Game Changers, along with James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jackie Chan.\nPamela's Cooking with Love (Anderson's plant-based cooking show) was greenlit in February 2023, and debuted on Canada's Flavour Network in February 2025. In addition, Anderson's 2024 plant-based cookbook I Love You: Recipes From the Heart, was nominated for a 2025 James Beard Award. The work of her photographer, Ditte Isager, was recognized in the \"Media: Visuals\" category. Actress and talk show host Drew Barrymore has noted that \"literally as a cookbook collector\" she finds I Love You: Recipes From the Heart to be \"the most beautiful cookbook I've ever seen - it is stunning.\"\nVegNews describes I Love You: Recipes From the Heart as one of \"The Best Vegan Cookbooks of 2024,\" Chowhound calls it one of the \"15 Best Vegetarian Cookbooks Of 2024,\" and SHE Media lists Anderson as one of \"22 Celebrity Moms Whose Cookbooks Will Solve Your Dinner Problems.\" During her interview with Anderson for Elle,  Martha Stewart stated that I Love You: Recipes From the Heart is \"very nicely done,\" and that Anderson drew from French cuisine \"in the most simple, beautiful way.\" She also told Anderson that her Pierogi recipe \"came out beautifully.\" In addition, after testing a salad recipe in the book, Jessica Wrubel states in Parade magazine that she is \"completely smitten with I Love You as a whole. Pamela's journey into this softer, more personal territory—whether through her recipes or her stories—makes the book feel like an extension of her heart. If you've ever doubted the staying power of Pamela Anderson's influence, let this cookbook—and this salad—prove you wrong.\"\n\n\n== Activism ==\n\n\n=== Animal rights ===\n\nAnderson advocates for animal rights, and is an active member of the animal protection organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).\nShe became the center of controversy when she posed for a PETA ad wearing a bikini with sections drawn on her body dividing it into ribs, rump, shoulder, etc., like a diagram of meat cuts; the ad's tagline was \"All Animals Have the Same Parts\". The ad was banned in Montreal, Quebec on grounds that it was sexist. Anderson retorted, \"In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with burqas – is that next? I didn't think that Canada would be so puritanical.\"\nShe became a company spokesperson for FrogAds, Inc. in March 2012, a company that used her as part of a media campaign in a pool operation of which she was unaware. In February 2014, she stripped for a Valentine's Day-themed ad for PETA, urging dog lovers to cuddle up with their pets during winter.\nOn July 8, 2015, Anderson wrote to Vladimir Putin to save whales. On December 15, 2015, Anderson, representing the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), met with top Kremlin officials regarding animals rights in Russia. On December 15, 2016, Anderson and IFAW officials met with Kremlin officials to discuss animal welfare and conservation.\nIn December 2015, Anderson, a close friend of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society founder Paul Watson and a long-time supporter and advisory board member, became a full board member in order to further its efforts in opposing the hunting of whales.\n\n\n=== Anti-pornography ===\nAnderson has been critical of pornography. In 2016, she co-authored a viral opinion article in The Wall Street Journal with Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach, in which they called online pornography a \"public hazard of unprecedented seriousness.\" The two called for a \"sensual revolution\" to replace \"pornography with eroticism, the alloying of sex with love, of physicality with personality, of the body's mechanics with imagination, of orgasmic release with binding relationships.\" They later gave a joint lecture at Oxford University to over 1,000 people. Boteach observed: \"It can be intimidating to talk about pornography and eroticism alongside an international sex symbol, but I think Pamela has handled it extremely well.\" The two also wrote a book together, Lust for Love (2018), about how meaningful, passionate sex has been declining, and called for a new sensual revolution that emphasizes partners connecting in the bedroom. However, in a 2008 interview with The Guardian, Anderson said that because she is aware of her Finnish ancestry, she considered moving to Finland and opening a strip club called \"Lapland\".\n\n\n=== Julian Assange ===\nIn December 2016, in a statement to People magazine, Anderson called WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange a \"hero\". She stated that he had done everyone \"a great service\" and that \"[e]veryone in the world has benefited because of WikiLeaks,\" while decrying how \"elaborate plots against him and made up sexual allegations could result in him being extradited to the US – where he would not be treated fairly – because of his exposure of truths.\" In April 2019, Anderson expressed anger on Twitter at Assange's expulsion from Ecuador's London embassy. In May 2019, Anderson visited Assange in Belmarsh prison with Kristinn Hrafnsson, and said she believed Assange to be innocent, saying, \"He is a good man, he is an incredible person. I love him, I can't imagine what he has been going through.\"\nIn October 2019, Anderson announced she would be travelling to Australia in November 2019 to challenge Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to stand up for Assange. In her announcement, she referenced the 'disparaging remarks' he made about her in 2018 and challenged him to debate the matter \"in front of the Australian people.\" She also wrote another letter to Morrison asking him to use his influence to secure Assange's release. Morrison replied with a letter, saying that his government would respect Britain's judicial process and Assange would not receive any special help. In the text of a speech she had intended to give at Parliament House, Canberra, Anderson said that Assange was suffering \"psychological torture\" in jail and that \"every moment he is in there, he is in danger\".\nOn January 18, 2021, Anderson spoke on the Fox News show Tucker Carlson Tonight, asking President Donald Trump to pardon Assange.\n\n\n=== Additional activism ===\nIn March 2005, Anderson became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics's MAC AIDS Fund, which helped people affected by AIDS and HIV. After becoming the official spokesmodel, Anderson raised money during Toronto, Tokyo, Dublin, and Athens events. Anderson became the celebrity spokesperson for the American Liver Foundation and served as the Grand Marshal of the SOS motorcycle ride fundraiser.\nIn 2009, Anderson wrote an open letter to President Barack Obama urging the legalization of cannabis.\nIn November 2016, Anderson starred in a video public service announcement produced by the National Limousine Association and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center as part of the Ride Responsibly initiative, titled The Driving Game, which aimed to shed light on the lack of universal driver regulations in the private ground transportation industry.\nAnderson once again starred in a video public service announcement produced by the National Limousine Association in January 2018, this time in partnership with Promoting Awareness | Victim Empowerment (PAVE), as part of the Ride Responsibly initiative. The video titled The Signs pushes for passenger safety and universal driver regulations in the private ground transportation industry.\nIn the 2019 Canadian federal election, she endorsed the Green Party of Canada.\nAfter supporting the yellow vests movement, Anderson attended a meeting of the European Spring with Yanis Varoufakis and Benoît Hamon. She appeared as a supporter on election posters of the German DiEM25 campaign in the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament elections.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Homes and family ===\nAnderson has two sons from her first marriage to Tommy Lee,  Brandon Thomas (born in 1996) and Dylan Jagger (born in 1997). She became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2004 while retaining her Canadian citizenship. After moving to California in 1989, Anderson felt that it was important to become an American citizen in order to vote and one day petition to bring her parents to the U.S. and care for them when they were older.\nAnderson purchased a beach home in Malibu, California for $1.8 million in 2001 and attempted to sell it in 2013 for $7.75 million, but later took it off the market. She previously lived in a mansion in Cassis, in the commune of Marseille, France.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, her childhood home in Canada became her permanent residence, and she sold her Malibu home. As of 2024 she lives with her dogs in Ladysmith on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and has a vegetable farm, Arcady.\n\n\n=== Marriages and relationships ===\nAnderson has been married five times. She married her first husband, Tommy Lee, drummer of Mötley Crüe, on February 19, 1995, after knowing him for only four days. They married on a beach, with Anderson in a white bikini and Lee in boardshorts. Lee was later sentenced to six months in the Los Angeles County Jail for spousal abuse after assaulting Anderson, and they divorced in 1998. A long custody dispute over their sons followed, and was finalized when they were granted joint custody in October 2002. In March 2002, Anderson publicly stated that she had contracted hepatitis C by sharing tattoo needles with Lee, and began writing a regular column for Jane magazine. In October 2003, Anderson jokingly said on Howard Stern's radio show that she did not expect to live more than 10 or 15 years, but this was taken seriously by many websites and tabloids. By 2015 Anderson had been cured of hepatitis C.\n\nAnderson later married Kid Rock, but after a miscarriage while in Vancouver shooting a new film, Blonde and Blonder, Anderson filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.\nIn September 2007, Anderson stated on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she was engaged, and on September 29, Anderson and Rick Salomon applied for a marriage license in Las Vegas. On October 6, 2007, Anderson married Salomon in a small wedding ceremony at The Mirage, between her two nightly appearances at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Hans Klok's magic show. The couple separated on December 13, and on February 22, 2008, Anderson requested through the courts that the marriage be annulled, citing fraud. In October 2013, Anderson stated on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she and Salomon were \"friends with benefits\". In January 2014, she announced that she had remarried Salomon on an unspecified date. Anderson filed for divorce from Salomon in February 2015. The divorce was finalized on April 29, 2015.\nShe was in a relationship with French soccer player Adil Rami from 2017 to 2019.\nOn December 24, 2020, Anderson married Dan Hayhurst, her bodyguard. On January 21, 2022, Anderson announced that she had filed for divorce and split with Hayhurst.\n\n\n=== Stolen home videos ===\nIn 1995, personal home videos of Anderson with her then-husband Tommy Lee recorded on a houseboat on Lake Mead were stolen and spliced together. They were then sold as a sex tape, which resulted in a legal fight and made her the subject of controversy. Anderson sued the video distribution company, Internet Entertainment Group, who posted the video on their website ClubLove in November 1997. Anderson was pregnant during the trial and, fearful of the extreme stress causing harm to her pregnancy, dismissed the case. The company began making the tape available to subscribers to its websites again, resulting in triple the normal traffic on the sites. In the 2023 Netflix documentary Pamela, a Love Story, Anderson said there was no confidential agreement over releasing rights to the video, and that she chose not to monetize it.\nThe story of the tape was portrayed in the Hulu 2022 miniseries Pam & Tommy. In Pamela, a Love Story, Anderson said that she was not consulted about the production of the series. Critics, journalists, and academics posited that the series was profiting from Anderson's trauma and likely doing further harm to her. Pamela, a Love Story verified those claims, in Anderson's own words. Producers of the series were able to develop the series without her participation, permission, or consent by optioning the rights to an article published by Rolling Stone in 2014. Some critics felt that this was a similar violation of privacy that mirrored the tape originally being stolen and distributed without Anderson's and Lee's consent.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== Documentary ===\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAnderson, Pamela (2004).

        "title": "War of the Worlds (2025 film)",
        "content": "War of the Worlds is a 2025 American screenlife science fiction thriller film based on H. G. Wells's 1898 novel The War of the Worlds. The film was directed by Rich Lee with a screenplay by Kenneth A. Golde and Marc Hyman from a story by Golde. It stars Ice Cube, Eva Longoria, Clark Gregg, Andrea Savage, Henry Hunter Hall, Iman Benson, Devon Bostick, and Michael O'Neill. \nWar of the Worlds was released by Universal Pictures on Amazon Prime Video on July 30, 2025. The film was panned by critics, with criticism directed at the cinematography, writing, Ice Cube's performance, and the film's product placement. \n\n\n== Plot ==\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) officer Will Radford works for a government surveillance program that can monitor every person on Earth. His relationship with his pregnant daughter Faith and son Dave is strained due to his use of the program to constantly monitor them. While helping FBI agents try to find a mysterious hacker, known as \"Disruptor\", meteors begin striking all over the planet. When large machines emerge from the meteorites and start attacking humans, Will and his friend Sandra from NASA conclude it is an alien invasion. Will helps Dave and Faith evade the machines before being called to a meeting with DHS Director Donald Briggs, U.S. Secretary of Defense Walter Crystal, and the United States president.\nWhen the president authorizes a military response, other governments do likewise. Will notices the machines are concentrating around data centers around the world, dispersing smaller insectoid creatures to harvest data inside the buildings. The data nourishes the alien machines, and they continue to defeat the human forces attacking them. Will is dismayed to discover that Disruptor is actually Dave, who links him to classified information regarding a surveillance operation known as \"Goliath\". These classified files reveal to Will that alien ships had previously arrived on Earth, and that the government knew they fed on data. Despite warnings that activating Goliath could warn the aliens, Briggs activated it anyway. Will confronts Briggs, who claims his actions were necessary to keep people safe. Briggs then locks Will out of the DHS system.\nWill, Dave and his team of hackers re-enter the system and plant a virus to disable the aliens' machines. The virus fails to stop the aliens, who locate and kill most of Dave's fellow hackers. The military plans to bomb the DHS headquarters (under which Goliath is kept), to ensure the aliens cannot access the system. Using a variation of Faith's cancer-destroying \"Cannibal\" code concealed in a flash drive delivered by her boyfriend, Amazon delivery driver Mark, Will breaks into the bunker and shuts down Goliath in time, simultaneously deactivating the aliens. The military calls off the bombing.\nWill and Dave are celebrated as heroes, Briggs is arrested for his crimes and Faith is credited with using her DNA studies to ensure the aliens' defeat. Crystal gives Will an offer to lead a new surveillance program that will not interfere with people's privacy, but he declines, saying, \"Now, I'm watching you.\" He then leaves to go to Faith's baby shower.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nIce Cube as William \"Will\" Radford, a surveillance and threat assessment expert at the Department of Homeland Security who watches people via a security program\nEva Longoria as Dr. Sandra Salas, Will's friend who works at NASA and monitors the weather\nClark Gregg as Donald Briggs, Director of the Department of Homeland Security\nIman Benson as Faith Radford, Will's daughter, a biomedical researcher who is pregnant\nHenry Hunter Hall as David \"Dave\" Radford, Will's son, a video gamer and hacker known as Disruptor\nDevon Bostick as Mark Goodman, Faith's boyfriend, Amazon delivery driver\nMichael O'Neill as Walter Crystal, United States Secretary of Defense\nAndrea Savage as Sheila Jeffries, FBI Agent\nJim Meskimen as the President of the United States\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn September 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ice Cube joined in the lead role in an untitled film produced by Timur Bekmambetov, which would be directed by Rich Lee with a screenplay by Kenneth A. Golde for Universal Pictures. Universal was intrigued by the project by Bekmambetov's use of screenlife technology, described as having \"the look of commercial event film but at the budget of a contained thriller\", which also allowed the actors and crew members to work in individual workspaces, which was seen as useful regarding the pandemic's impact on the film industry. In October, Eva Longoria joined the cast, and Universal greenlit the film and \"fast tracked it by having it go into production\" that month. By April 2024, it was revealed to be an adaptation of the 1898 novel The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells.\nProduction lasted for 15 days. Post production lasted for 2 years. According to producer Patrick Aiello, the film was originally developed for a theatrical release by Universal, and it was later acquired by Amazon which included an Amazon delivery driver character as fitting to its platform.\nIn July 2025, Clark Gregg, Andrea Savage, Henry Hunter Hall, Iman Benson, Devon Bostick, and Michael O'Neill were revealed to have been part of the project. The film was produced using a screenlife technique that places audiences inside the action through the lens of phones, computers, and tablets. Bekmambetov added: \"If aliens invaded today, how would we experience it? Most likely, we'd be watching it on our phones, in that way, it's kind of a modern spin on Orson Welles's War of the Worlds. Back then, he used radio, the most popular technology of the time, to make people believe the invasion was real. Today, that medium is the screen of our devices.\" Jon Natchez composed the film's score.\n\n\n== Release ==\nWar of the Worlds was released by Universal Pictures on Amazon Prime Video on July 30, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 4% of 45 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Stranding Ice Cube in an inept screensaver with wall-to-wall product placement, War of the Worlds will make audiences consider giving peace a chance instead.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 6 out of 100, based on seven critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". \nThe product placement from Amazon was panned by critics. The film's climax, where an Amazon employee uses a Prime Air drone to deliver Ice Cube’s character a flash drive, was heavily criticized. Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave it zero out of four stars, considered the constant promotion of Amazon \"truly morally icky\", and recommended watching Union instead. \nPeter Debruge of Variety considered the film to be a poor adaptation of The War of the Worlds, criticizing Ice Cube's performance. NBC's Austin Mullen called it one of the worst films of 2025. The movie has entered Rotten Tomatoes's list of \"100 Worst Movies of All Time\" at #79, as of August 2025. Kevin Nguyen of The Verge described the movie as \"so bad it's good\". Entertainment Weekly reviewer Jordan Hoffman gave it a positive review, saying, \"It's certainly stupid, but it's also a great deal of fun.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of works based on The War of the Worlds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWar of the Worlds at IMDb",

        "content": "YouTube  is an American social media and online video sharing platform owned by Google. YouTube was founded on February 14, 2005, by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim, and Steve Chen, who were former employees of PayPal. Headquartered in San Bruno, California, it is the second-most-visited website in the world, after Google Search. In January 2024, YouTube had more than 2.7 billion monthly active users, who collectively watched more than one billion hours of videos every day. As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute, and as of mid-2024, there were approximately 14.8 billion videos in total.\nOn November 13, 2006, YouTube was purchased by Google for US$1.65 billion (equivalent to $2.39 billion in 2024). Google expanded YouTube's business model of generating revenue from advertisements alone, to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content explicitly produced for YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube incorporated the Google AdSense program, generating more revenue for both YouTube and approved content creators. In 2023, YouTube's advertising revenue totaled $31.7 billion, a 2% increase from the $31.1 billion reported in 2022. From Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, YouTube's combined revenue from advertising and subscriptions exceeded $50 billion.\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short and feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, TV spots, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between \"YouTubers\" and corporate sponsors. Established media, news, and entertainment corporations have also created and expanded their visibility to YouTube channels to reach bigger audiences.\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth and success, the platform has been criticized for its facilitation of the spread of misinformation and copyrighted content, routinely violating its users' privacy, excessive censorship, endangering the safety of children and their well-being, and for its inconsistent implementation of platform guidelines.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding and initial growth (2005–2006) ===\n\nYouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim, and Steve Chen. The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay. Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site. Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not. They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward. Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.\n\nYouTube began as a venture capital–funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two. YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California. In February 2005, the company registered www.youtube.com. The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site. The same day, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views. The site exited out of beta in December 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day. Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.\nYouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was founded in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor. On December 17, 2005 - the same week YouTube exited beta - NBCUniversal Saturday Night Live ran a sketch \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for Saturday Night Live, \"Lazy Sunday\"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website. Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns. Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content. The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.\nThe choice of the name youtube.com led to problems for a similarly named website, utube.com. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment (Universal Tube), filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006, after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to www.utubeonline.com.\n\n\n=== \"Broadcast Yourself\" era (2006–2013) ===\nOn October 9, 2006, Google announced that they had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock. The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006. Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube. It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\nThe company experienced rapid growth. The Daily Telegraph wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000. By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore. That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site. In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute. However, most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site. That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red. A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013. By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014.\n\nDuring that time, the company also went through some organizational changes. In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California. Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company in October 2010. In December 2009, YouTube partnered with Vevo. In April 2010, Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" became the most-viewed video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million views on May 9, 2010.\nYouTube faced a major lawsuit by Viacom International in 2011 that nearly resulted in the discontinuation of the website. The lawsuit was filed due to alleged copyright infringement of Viacom's material by YouTube. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that YouTube was not liable, and thus YouTube won the case in 2012.\n\n\n=== Susan Wojcicki's leadership (2014–2023) ===\n\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014. In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million. The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees. YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well as a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.\nThrough this period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements. In 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels. This effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with US$4.99 channel subscriptions. These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability, launched in 2017, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment highlighted. In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as \"Music Key\", which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service. The service continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year), premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.\nThe company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile app known as YouTube Kids in 2015, which was designed to provide an experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features. Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch. The company was attacked in April 2018, when a shooting occurred at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter.\nBy February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute. Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased. Forbes estimated that YouTube accounted for 16% of all internet traffic, as of 2024, up from 11% in 2018 i.e. pre-pandemic. In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix said they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request. YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.\"\nAfter a 2018 complaint alleging violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the company was fined $170 million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13. YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children's privacy. Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems, YouTube started treating all videos designated as \"made for kids\" as liable under COPPA on January 6, 2020. Joining the YouTube Kids app, the company created a supervised mode, designed more for tweens, in 2021. Additionally, to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels, YouTube released YouTube Shorts, a short-form video platform. During that period, YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies. For over a year, in 2018–19, no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products. In 2020, Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.\nAfter testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November 2021, claiming the reason for the removal was, based on its internal research, that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading. While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls, others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as \"a stupid idea\", and said that the real reason behind the change was \"not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed.\" He felt that users' ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, \"The process works, and there's a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines.\" Shortly after the announcement, software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike, an open-source, third-party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video's number of dislikes. In a letter published on January 25, 2022, by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision, but reiterated that she stands by this decision, claiming that \"it reduced dislike attacks.\"\nIn 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube \"ended\" the experiment on September 19 of the same year. In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.\n\n\n=== Neal Mohan leadership (2023–present) ===\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor. Wojcicki took on an advisory role for Google and parent company Alphabet. Wojcicki died a year and a half later from non-small-cell lung cancer, on August 9, 2024.\nIn late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform. Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying \"Video player will be blocked after 3 videos\". Users of ad blockers are shown a message asking them to allow ads or inviting them to subscribe to the ad-free YouTube Premium subscription plan. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service. In April 2024, YouTube announced it would be \"strengthening our enforcement on third-party apps that violate YouTube's Terms of Service, specifically ad-blocking apps\". Starting in June 2024, Google Chrome announced that it would be replacing Manifest V2 in favor of Manifest V3, effectively killing support for most ad-blockers. Around the same time, YouTube started using server-side ad injection, which allows the platform to inject the ads directly into the video, instead of having the ad as a separate file which can be blocked.\nIn September 2023, YouTube announced an in-app gaming platform called Playables. It was made accessible to all users in May 2024, expanding from an initial offering limited to premium subscribers. In December 2024, YouTube began testing a new multiplayer feature for that service, supporting multiplayer functionality across desktop and mobile devices. As of December 2024 the Playables catalog has over 130 games in various genres, including trivia, action and sports.\nIn December 2024, YouTube introduced new guidelines prohibiting videos with clickbait titles to enhance content quality and combat misinformation. The platform aims to penalize creators using misleading or sensationalized titles, with potential actions including video removal or channel suspension. According to YouTube, this guideline will gradually roll out in India first, but will expand to more countries in the coming months.\nOn February 14, 2025, YouTube celebrated 20 years since its founding.\nOn July 30, 2025, amid the implementation of the Online Safety Act 2023 in the United Kingdom, Google announced that it will begin to enforce \"age assurance\" policies for selected users in the United States as a trial. Machine learning will be used to determine the age of the user (regardless of any account information indicating their age) and restrict access to certain content and features across all Google properties, including YouTube (including, in particular, disabling personalized advertising and enabling certain digital wellbeing limits), if they are assumed to be under 18. On YouTube, this will be based on factors such as searches and video history, and the age of the account. The user must go through age verification via payment, scanned ID, or selfie to access all features if they are detected to be a minor.\n\n\n== Senior leadership ==\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and kept the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023. The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nYouTube offers different features based on user verification, such as standard or basic features like uploading videos, creating playlists, and using YouTube Music, with limits based on daily activity (verification via phone number or channel history increases feature availability and daily usage limits); intermediate or additional features like longer videos (over 15 minutes), live streaming, custom thumbnails, and creating podcasts; advanced features like content ID appeals, embedding live streams, applying for monetization, clickable links, adding chapters, and pinning comments on videos or posts.\n\n\n== Videos ==\n\nIn January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television. In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.\nIn December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. That was disputed by Billboard, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube. On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behavior which caused a video's view count to freeze at \"301\" (later \"301+\") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud. YouTube view counts once again updated in real time. Since September 2019, subscriber counts are abbreviated. Only three leading digits of channels' subscriber counts are indicated publicly, compromising the function of third-party real-time indicators such as that of Social Blade. Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio.\nOn November 11, 2021, after testing out this change in March of the same year, YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos, making them invisible to viewers. The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment. Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool, according to YouTube.\nYouTube has an estimated 14.8 billion videos with about 4% of those never having a view. Just over 85% have fewer than 1,000 views.\n\n\n=== Copyright issues ===\n\nYouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns. At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws. Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted. From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.\nIn August 2008, a US court ruled in Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material. YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.\nIn the 2011 case of Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube. He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor. In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users. On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.\nIn April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice. As part of YouTube Music, Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in 2017, which was followed by separate agreements other major labels, which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube. By 2019, creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video, with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label. Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use.\n\n\n==== Content ID ====\n\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute. The system, which was initially called \"Video Identification\" and later became known as Content ID, creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found. When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\nAn independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was \"surprisingly resilient\" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible. The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use. If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.\nBefore 2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute. Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the \"Video Manager\". YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\nIn 2021, two accounts linked to RT DE, the German channel of the Russian state-owned RT network, were removed for breaching YouTube's policies relating to COVID-19. Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021. Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, YouTube removed all channels funded by the Russian state. YouTube expanded the removal of Russian content from its site to include channels described as 'pro-Russian'. In June 2022, the War Gonzo channel run by Russian military blogger and journalist Semyon Pegov was deleted.\nIn July 2023, YouTube removed the channel of British journalist Graham Phillips, active in covering the war in Donbas from 2014. In August 2023, a Moscow court fined Google 3 million rubles, around $35,000, for not deleting what it said was \"fake news about the war in Ukraine\".\nIn October 2024, a Russian court fined Google 2 undecillion rubles (equivalent to US$20 decillion) for restricting Russian state media channels on YouTube. The fine imposed by Russia is far greater than the world's total GDP, estimated at US$110 trillion by the International Monetary Fund. State news agency TASS reported that Google is allowed to return to the Russian market only if it complies with the court's decision. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov labeled the court decision as \"symbolic\" and warned Google that it \"should not be restricting the actions of our broadcasters on its platform.\"\n\n\n=== April Fools gags ===\n\nYouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\". The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\". In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\"\nThe next year, the site celebrated its \"100th anniversary\" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900s-style films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat. In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD. In 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company The Onion to claim in an uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.\nIn 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as \"Clocking\", \"Kissing Dad\", and \"Glub Glub Water Dance\". The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from \"Sandstorm\" by Darude. In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.\n\n\n== Services ==\n\n\n=== YouTube Premium ===\n\nYouTube Premium (formerly Music Key and YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices. YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music \"All Access\" service. On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access to exclusive original content. As of November 2016, the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis. As of June 2017, the first season of YouTube Originals had received 250 million views in total.\n\n\n=== YouTube Kids ===\n\nYouTube Kids is an American children's video app developed by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. The app was developed in response to parental and government scrutiny on the content available to children. The app provides a version of the service oriented towards children, with curated selections of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing for children aged under 13, 8 or 5, depending on the age grouping chosen. First released on February 15, 2015, as an Android and iOS mobile app, the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as well as for Android TV. On May 27, 2020, it became available on Apple TV. As of September 2019, the app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province. YouTube launched a web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.\n\n\n=== YouTube Music ===\n\nOn September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.\nIn early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music. On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named \"YouTube Music\" was launched for people who mostly listen to music on YouTube. \n\n\n=== YouTube Movies & TV ===\nYouTube Movies & TV is a video on demand (VOD) service that offers movies and television shows for purchase or rental, depending on availability, along with a selection of movies (encompassing between 100 and 500 titles overall) that are free to stream, with interspersed ad breaks. YouTube began offering free-to-view movie titles to its users in November 2018; selections of new movies are added and others removed, unannounced each month.\nIn March 2021, Google announced plans to gradually deprecate the Google Play Movies & TV app, and eventually migrate all users to the YouTube app's Movies & TV store to view, rent and purchase movies and TV shows (first affecting Roku, Samsung, LG, and Vizio smart TV users on July 15). Google Play Movies & TV formally shut down on January 17, 2024, with the web version of that platform migrated to YouTube as an expansion of the Movies & TV store to desktop users. (Other functions of Google Play Movies & TV were integrated into the Google TV service.)\n\n\n==== YouTube Primetime Channels ====\nOn November 1, 2022, YouTube launched Primetime Channels, a channel store platform offering third-party subscription streaming add-ons sold a la carte through the YouTube website and app, competing with similar subscription add-on stores operated by Apple, Prime Video and Roku. The add-ons can be purchased through the YouTube Movies & TV hub or through the official YouTube channels of the available services; subscribers of YouTube TV add-ons that are sold through Primetime Channels can also access their content via the YouTube app and website. A total of 34 streaming services (including Paramount+, Showtime, Starz, MGM+, AMC+ and ViX+) were initially available for purchase.\nNFL Sunday Ticket, as part of a broader residential distribution deal with Google signed in December 2022 that also made it available to YouTube TV subscribers, was added to Primetime Channels as a standalone add-on on August 16, 2023. The ad-free tier of Max was added to Primetime Channels on December 12, 2023, coinciding with YouTube TV converting its separate HBO (for base plan subscribers) and HBO Max (for all subscribers) linear/VOD add-ons into a single combined Max offering.\n\n\n=== YouTube TV ===\n\nOn February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017, the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC, along with selected MyNetworkTV affiliates and independent stations in certain markets), as well as approximately 60 cable channels owned by companies such as The Walt Disney Company, Paramount Global, Fox Corporation, NBCUniversal, Allen Media Group and Warner Bros. Discovery (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN).\nSubscribers can also receive premium cable channels (including HBO (via a combined Max add-on that includes in-app and log-in access to the service), Cinemax, Showtime, Starz and MGM+) and other subscription services (such as NFL Sunday Ticket, MLB.tv, NBA League Pass, Curiosity Stream and Fox Nation) as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content. In September 2022, YouTube TV began allowing customers to purchase most of its premium add-ons (excluding certain services such as NBA League Pass and AMC+) without an existing subscription to its base package.\n\n\n=== YouTube Go ===\n\nIn September 2016, YouTube Go was announced, as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets. It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution.\nIn February 2017, YouTube Go was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa. On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's population. In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down YouTube Go in August 2022.\n\n\n=== YouTube Shorts ===\n\nIn September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts. The platform was first tested in India but as of March 2021 has expanded to other countries including the United States with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long. The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app. Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos. The platform had its global beta launch in July 2021.\n\n\n=== YouTube Stories ===\nIn 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called \"YouTube Reels\". The feature was nearly identical to Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories. YouTube later renamed the feature \"YouTube Stories\". It was only available to creators who had more than 10,000 subscribers and could only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app. On May 25, 2023, YouTube announced that they would be shutting down this feature on June 26, 2023.\n\n\n=== YouTube VR ===\n\nIn November 2016, YouTube released YouTube VR, a dedicated version with an interface for VR devices, for Google's Daydream mobile VR platform on Android. In November 2018, YouTube VR was released on the Oculus Store for the Oculus Go headset. YouTube VR was updated since for compatibility with successive Quest devices, and was ported to Pico 4.\nYouTube VR allows for access to all YouTube-hosted videos, but particularly supports headset access for 360° and 180°-degree video (both in 2D and stereoscopic 3D). Starting with the Oculus Quest, the app was updated for compatibility with mixed-reality passthrough modes on VR headsets. In April 2024, YouTube VR was updated to support 8K SDR video on Meta Quest 3.\n\n\n=== Playables ===\nIn 2010, YouTube added Snake as a hidden game inside of their video player. In May 2024, YouTube introduced Playables, a set of around 75 free-to-play games that can be played on the platform.\n\n\n=== Automatic language dubbing ===\nIn December 2024, YouTube added the functionality of automatic language dubbing, which uses AI to produce translations of videos into different languages.\n\n\n== Criticism and controversies ==\n\n\n=== Privacy concerns ===\n\n\n=== Censorship and bans ===\n\nYouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including:\n\nLimiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.\nPreventing criticism of a ruler (e.g. in North Korea), government (e.g. in China) or its actions (e.g. in Morocco), government officials (e.g. in Turkey and Libya), or religion (e.g. in Pakistan).\nMorality-based laws, e.g. in Iran.\nAccess to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection laws (e.g. in Germany), violations of hate speech, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth, which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with \"restricted mode\". Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to its bandwidth limitations and the site's potential for distraction.\nAs of 2018, public access to YouTube is blocked in many countries, including China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. In some countries, YouTube is blocked for more limited periods of time, such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.\nReports emerged that since October 2019, comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the Chinese Communist Party (共匪 \"communist bandit\" or 五毛 \"50 Cent Party\", referring to state-sponsored commentators) were being automatically deleted within 15 seconds.\nSpecific incidents where YouTube has been blocked include:\n\nThailand blocked access in April 2007 over a video said to be insulting the Thai king.\nMorocco blocked access in May 2007, possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara. YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007, after Maroc Telecom unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere \"technical glitch\".\nTurkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. In November 2010, a video of the Turkish politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly, and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video. During the two and a half-year block of YouTube, the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in Turkey. In 2014, Turkey blocked the access for the second time, after \"a high-level intelligence leak\".\nPakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, because of \"offensive material\" towards the Islamic faith, including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad. This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries. On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government. Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software. In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing \"growing sacrilegious content\". The ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government. However, individual videos deemed offensive to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked. Pakistan again placed a ban on YouTube in September 2012, after the site refused to remove the film Innocence of Muslims. The ban was lifted in January 2016 after YouTube launched a Pakistan-specific version.\nLibya blocked access on January 24, 2010, because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch. In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.\nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sudan blocked access in September 2012 following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film Innocence of Muslims which had been posted on the site. A court in the southern Russian Republic of Chechnya ruled that Innocence of Muslims should be banned. In Libya and Egypt, it was blamed for violent protests. YouTube stated: \"This video—which is widely available on the Web—is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries.\"\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube announced on March 1 the immediate removal of RT (and other Russian government-funded outlets) from its platform in Europe. The removal was soon expanded globally. From late 2024, users across Russia started experiencing sharp declines in YouTube loading speeds.\n\n\n== Social impact ==\n\nPrivate individuals and large production corporations have used YouTube to grow their audiences. Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic. Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television. While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels.\" In 2013 Forbes' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media. Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year. By early 2013, Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts.\n\nObserving that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been \"fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution\", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that \"what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication.\" Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch \"the biggest learning cycle in human history.\" In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what Forbes' Michael Noer called \"the largest school in the world\", with technology poised to disrupt how people learn. YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award, the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that \"both embodies and promotes democracy.\" The Washington Post reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most-subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white. A Pew Research Center study reported the development of \"visual journalism\", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation. The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.\nYouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape. Describing the Arab Spring (2010–2012), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using \"Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.\" In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the \"Kony 2012\" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video \"will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.\"\n\nConversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance. In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators not only to promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the \"YouTube Generation\". Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.\nSome YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as Innocence of Muslims (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally. TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field. Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in The New York Times that such videos have \"surprising implications\" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.\nA 2017 article in The New York Times Magazine posited that YouTube had become \"the new talk radio\" for the far right. Almost a year before YouTube's January 2019 announcement that it would begin a \"gradual change\" of \"reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways\", Zeynep Tufekci had written in The New York Times that, \"(g)iven its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century\". Under YouTube's changes to its recommendation engine, the most-recommended channel evolved from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (2016) to Fox News (2019). According to a 2020 study, viewership of far-right videos on YouTube peaked in 2017 and \"a growing body of journalistic evidence\" suggested that YouTube was radicalizing young men through its recommendation engine, but that such evidence was \"fraught with a bias towards sensationalism\". It also found more \"mainstream-adjacent Conservative creators\" gaining over alt-right and extremist videos by 2020. A 2022 study found that \"despite widespread concerns that YouTube's algorithms send people down 'rabbit holes' with recommendations to extremist videos, little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture\", and that such exposure was \"heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment.\" A 2024 study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue found that YouTube frequently recommended Christian videos and right-leaning and culturally conservative \"culture war\" videos by Fox News and male lifestyle influencers to accounts that did not show an interest in such topics.\nThe Legion of Extraordinary Dancers and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra selected their membership based on individual video performances. Further, the cyber-collaboration charity video \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)\" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work, with The Tokyo Times noting the \"We Pray for You\" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.\nThe anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens, that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries. Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video \"My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm\", legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy. In May 2018, after London Metropolitan Police claimed that drill music videos glamorizing violence gave rise to gang violence, YouTube deleted 30 videos.\n\n\n== Finances ==\nPrior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing. In June 2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales. In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion. In 2013, it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to e-Marketer, while others estimated $4.7 billion. The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising. In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month. The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.\nGoogle first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February 2020 as part of Alphabet's 2019 financial report. According to Google, YouTube had made US$15.1 billion in ad revenue in 2019, in contrast to US$8.1 billion in 2017 and US$11.1 billion in 2018. YouTube's revenues made up nearly 10% of the total Alphabet revenue in 2019. These revenues accounted for approximately 20 million subscribers combined between YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions, and 2 million subscribers to YouTube TV.\nYouTube had $29.2 billion ads revenue in 2022, up by $398 million from the prior year. In Q2 2024, ad revenue rose to $8.66 billion, up 13% on Q1.\n\n\n=== Partnership with corporations ===\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006. In March 2007, it struck a deal with the BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment. In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney. In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners. In January 2010, YouTube introduced a film rentals service, available in many countries, and TV shows can be bought in several countries. The service offers over 6,000 films.\n\n\n==== 2017 advertiser boycott ====\nIn March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered safely and appropriately\". The Guardian newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\". In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.\nOn April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that to \"ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules\", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000-lifetime views, before they may join the YouTube Partner Program.\n\n\n=== YouTuber earnings ===\n\nIn May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site. YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.\nThere are over two million members of the YouTube Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually, no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.\nYouTube's policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising, including videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\" (unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\"), and videos whose user comments contain \"inappropriate\" content. In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription for viewers to watch videos. In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription. On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watch-time within the past 12 months and 1,000 subscribers. The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.\nYouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels. The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal, ruby, and red tinted crystal glass are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million, fifty million subscribers, and one hundred million subscribers, respectively.\nYouTube's policies on \"advertiser-friendly content\" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language, sexual content, and \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\", unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\". In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Philip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was \"censorship by a different name\". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had \"improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators\". Boing Boing reported in 2019 that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization.\nIn the United States as of November 2020, and June 2021 worldwide, YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform, even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program. This will occur on channels whose content is deemed \"advertiser-friendly\", and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the uploader.\n\n\n=== Revenue to copyright holders ===\nThe majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue. In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue. In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games. In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program. On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program. Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLists\nComparison of video hosting services\nList of Google Easter eggs#YouTube\nList of Internet phenomena\nList of most-disliked YouTube videos\nList of most-liked YouTube videos\nList of most-viewed YouTube videos\nList of most-subscribed YouTube channels\nList of online video platforms\nList of YouTubers\nLawsuits\nViacom International Inc. v.

        "title": "The Naked Gun (2025 film)",
        "content": "The Naked Gun is a 2025 American action crime comedy film directed by Akiva Schaffer, who co-wrote the screenplay along with Dan Gregor and Doug Mand. A legacy sequel to Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult (1994) and the fourth film in The Naked Gun franchise, the film stars Liam Neeson in the main role, with Pamela Anderson, Paul Walter Hauser, Kevin Durand, and Danny Huston co-starring in supporting roles. Its plot follows the son of Lt. Frank Drebin who must succeed in his father's footsteps to prevent the closure of Police Squad.\nA fourth The Naked Gun film was originally announced in 2009, as a direct-to-TV sequel starring Leslie Nielsen, with Alan Spencer being attached to write the film; however, the project was cancelled due to Spencer's departure and Nielsen's death. After a languishing through several years of development, including being redeveloped as a reboot starring Ed Helms in 2013, it was officially announced in January 2021 that Seth MacFarlane had been hired to develop the project, and he expressed interest in casting Neeson in the main role. Although MacFarlane was hired to direct, Schaffer replaced him after the film was greenlit in October 2022, and Neeson was officially cast in the main role. Anderson was cast in April 2024, and further casting took place the following month. Filming began in Atlanta, Georgia in May and wrapped in June.\nThe Naked Gun premiered at the SVA Theater in Manhattan on July 28, 2025, and was released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on August 1, 2025. It received positive reviews from critics, who deemed it faithful to the original films, and has grossed $96 million worldwide against a $42 million budget.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nLieutenant Frank Drebin Jr. of the LAPD Police Squad singlehandedly dispatches a gang of bank robbers while disguised as a schoolgirl. Unbeknownst to him, this was a distraction to steal a gadget called the \"P.L.O.T. Device\" from a safe deposit box. Police Chief Davis reassigns Drebin when his over-the-top law enforcement becomes a legal liability. While paying tribute to his father Frank Drebin Sr., he prays to him to send him an owl as a sign of his approval.\nDrebin investigates software engineer Simon Davenport's fatal car crash, deeming it suicide, but notices a matchbook at the scene. Simon's sister Beth, a crime novelist, argues otherwise, but Drebin discourages her from investigating further. Drebin finds Richard Cane, Simon's wealthy employer at Edentech, at the company's tech expo. After they mutually appreciate the Black Eyed Peas, Cane donates a self-driving electric car to Police Squad – which wreaks havoc with Drebin behind the wheel – and recommends his personal nightclub. Drebin notices the matchbook found at Simon's crash site has the same logo as the nightclub.\nCane privately demonstrates how he will use the stolen P.L.O.T. (\"Primordial Law of Toughness\") Device to revert humans to their barbarian nature, culling the population for his fellow billionaires, who will be safely insulated in a bunker. Drebin, while interrogating one of the bank robbers, learns about the deposit box, which was Simon's, connecting the two cases. At Cane's club, Beth distracts Cane with improvised, atrocious scat singing while Drebin fights many goons to access security footage, discovering that Simon met discreetly with a journalist. Davis suspends Drebin for insubordination. Beth stays with the demoralized Drebin, and he considers finally moving on from memories of his late wife. Drebin and Beth spend a romantic weekend at an alpine lodge. They have a threesome with a magical, living snowman, but the snowman turns murderous after they neglect it.\nDrebin finds the journalist murdered and is easily tricked into incriminating himself. He flees in the electric car, but Cane overrides the controls and attempts to kill Drebin just as he did Simon. Drebin blows out the windshield, but is trapped again by the car driving head-on into balloons, bees, and a replacement windshield. He accidentally activates Clippy, who helpfully unlocks the doors. Meanwhile, Police Squad has been decommissioned. Beth reveals that Simon feared the misuse of the P.L.O.T. Device, but Drebin suspects that Beth is using him and angrily leaves her home.\nDrebin captures Cane's henchman Gustafson and frightens him into confessing to Cane's plan to activate the P.L.O.T. Device at the New Year's ball drop at a mixed martial arts match. Drebin heads to the match at the \"Ponzi-scheme.com Arena\", equipped with an earpiece that blocks the P.L.O.T. Device's influence. Beth plans to kill Cane, but he sees this coming as telegraphed in her book. Drebin finds the P.L.O.T. Device inside the New Year's balls. He loses his pants as the balls drop, indecently exposing himself to the entire audience, leading them to not respect his order to evacuate. The P.L.O.T. Device activates, and mindless violence erupts throughout the city. Drebin fights through innocents by ricocheting ejected handgun magazines, but cannot catch up with the escaping Cane. His father's spirit arrives as an owl, airlifting Drebin and blinding Cane with feces. Cane folds in agony after one punch to the gut. Beth nearly shoots Cane in revenge, but Drebin talks her down. Drebin and Beth use the P.L.O.T. Device to calm the crowd and embrace lovingly as Cane is arrested. In the aftermath, Drebin faces \"investigation\" by \"Internal Affairs\" – actually the name of a tropical resort, where he spends his time with Beth.\nIn a post-credits scene, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic performs onstage to an empty bunker.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nLiam Neeson as Lt. Frank Drebin Jr.\nPamela Anderson as Beth Davenport\nPaul Walter Hauser as Capt. Ed Hocken Jr.\nDanny Huston as Richard Cane\nCCH Pounder as Chief Davis\nKevin Durand as Sig Gustafson\nLiza Koshy as Detective Barnes\nEddie Yu as Detective Park\nMoses Jones as \"Not Nordberg Jr.\"\nCody Rhodes as bartender\nBusta Rhymes as bank robber\nJon Anik, Michael Bisping, Bruce Buffer, John McCarthy, Dave Bautista, and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic all appear as themselves; Yankovic had previously made cameo appearances in all three of the preceding films in the franchise. MMA fighters Justin Gaethje and Kamaru Usman appear as fighters in the film's \"WWFC\" event scene. Additionally, Jason MacDonald appears as Simon Davenport and Priscilla Presley makes a cameo appearance reprising her role as Jane Spencer-Drebin, the wife of the late Frank Drebin and mother of Frank Drebin Jr. Along with director Akiva Schaffer, Andy Samberg and Jorma Taccone provided additional voice lines.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Cancelled attempt with Leslie Nielsen ===\nAlthough 33 1/3: The Final Insult (1994) was intended to be the final installment, in 2009, it was revealed that a fourth film starring Leslie Nielsen was planned as a direct-to-TV sequel, titled The Naked Gun: What 4? The Rhythm of Evil. The script followed the story of Frank training a young rookie, but due to financial reasons, it was canceled in 2009. It was written by Alan Spencer, who said he signed on to write the film as a \"rescue mission\" to save an inferior sequel from happening, and impressed Paramount executives and online reviewers so much that it was briefly shifted to the theatrical department, while the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team, original writers of the saga, tried to stop it from happening.\nSpencer wrote a sizable role for Nielsen, who would be passing the torch to a new generation of incompetent police, but Paramount asked him to reduce the part to a cameo for budgetary reasons, and later decided to remove his character altogether. After this last request, Spencer left the project. Nielsen died in November 2010.\n\n\n=== First development with Ed Helms ===\nIn December 2013, Paramount Pictures announced that a reboot of The Naked Gun franchise was in development with Ed Helms cast in the role of Frank Drebin, while the script was being co-written by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant. By January 2014, Garant revealed that the working title of the project was Episode IV: A New Hope, while announcing that it was intended to be a sequel to the original films. Helms was intended to portray a character that introduces himself as \"Frank Drebin, no relation\" so that the movie can introduce a new protagonist without contradicting what came before. In March 2015, David Zucker stated that he was offered a producing role on the project, but had declined to be involved because he felt like it would differ in comedic style and ultimately be inferior to his original films. In August 2015, Helms confirmed that the script was still being written, while acknowledging the concerns that Zucker had with modern-day audience reception, and a need for something other than the spoof genre of the previous movies.\n\n\n=== Second development with David Zucker and Pat Proft ===\nBy March 2017, a re-write of the script was being completed by David Zucker and Pat Proft, with the plot being reworked to feature the son of Frank Drebin, who would have been a secret agent rather than a policeman. The script was originally titled The Naked Gun 444 1/4: Nordberg Did It, but was later renamed Naked: Impossible, parodying the Mission Impossible, Bourne and Daniel Craig James Bond franchises. Zucker felt that \"they don't make cop movies anymore. When you do parody, you've got to spoof something current.\" According to Zucker, Jon Gonda at Paramount liked the script, written by him and Pat Proft that was presented to the studio in 2018, but that somewhere along the line the studio decided not to go with it. Zucker also said that he went on a meeting with Paramount in around 2019, where a female head of production complained over a \"mild\" joke about a \"police officer having to adjust her Kevlar vest or have a breast reduction\". He explained saying that a \"stupid, mild joke\" was too much for them [Paramount].\n\n\n=== Third development with Seth MacFarlane ===\nIn January 2021, it was announced that Seth MacFarlane had been hired to further develop the project. After MacFarlane had previously expressed interest in casting Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin Jr. in 2015, he was hired by the studio. MacFarlane and Paramount approached Neeson with a pitch to star in the movie. In June, Neeson said MacFarlane was working on a new draft of the script, with the studio additionally negotiating his potential role as director. He expressed excitement at the opportunity to explore a more comedic role should he decide to star in the movie, while stating that development on the project was ongoing. In February 2022, Neeson again confirmed that Paramount was still courting him to star in the legacy sequel.\nIn October 2022, the film was greenlit with Neeson in the lead role as Frank Drebin Jr. and Akiva Schaffer directing. Dan Gregor and Doug Mand were hired to write a new draft of the script from a previous draft with contributions from Mark Hentemann and Alec Sulkin. In December 2024, it was determined by the Writers Guild of America that Gregor, Mand, and Schaffer would be credited on the screenplay while Hentemann, MacFarlane, and Sulkin contributed additional literary material. MacFarlane and Erica Huggins served as producers, under their production company Fuzzy Door Productions, with Domain Entertainment providing additional funding. Zucker was again offered a credit on the film, as an executive producer, but he declined, saying he did not wish to claim credit for a project he was not involved with. Near the film's 2025 release, Zucker expressed dissatisfaction with the crew not involving him. Zucker said after the film's release that he had no intention of watching it (as was standard procedure for him regarding sequels to his work) but was pleased it was a success and was on good terms with the director and writing crew. He had declined to get involved in the film mainly because he believed he would have done the film differently.\nIn April 2024, Pamela Anderson joined the cast. Anderson was originally offered the role of Tanya Peters in The Final Insult before the role eventually went to Anna Nicole Smith. In May, Paul Walter Hauser joined the cast, playing Capt. Ed Hocken, alongside Kevin Durand in an undisclosed villain role, as well as Danny Huston, Liza Koshy, Cody Rhodes, CCH Pounder and Busta Rhymes.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began on May 6, 2024, in Atlanta under the working title Law of Toughness, and it wrapped on June 28.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe Naked Gun premiered at the SVA Theater in New York on July 28, 2025, and released in the United States on August 1, 2025. It was originally scheduled for July 18, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of September 2, 2025, The Naked Gun has grossed $52 million in the United States and Canada, and $44 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $96 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside The Bad Guys 2, and was projected to gross around $15 million from 3,344 theaters in its opening weekend. It grossed $6.3 million on its first day, including $1.6 million from Thursday previews. It went on to open to $16.8 million, finishing in third behind holdover The Fantastic Four: First Steps and The Bad Guys 2.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 301 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"With Liam Neeson's gravelly gravitas proving to be a perfect fit for Frank Drebin's deadpan buffoonery, The Naked Gun revives the original trilogy's daffy sense of humor like it never went out of style.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.\nHanna Flint of Time Out gave the film a perfect five stars out of five rating, and wrote, \"In the thick of reboot culture, The Naked Gun is a prime example of filmmakers taking a nostalgic piece of cinema and making good on its legacy. It honours the humour above all, and you’d be hard-pushed to find a funnier film this year.\" IndieWire's David Ehrlich awarded the film with B+ grade, and wrote, \"That's a delicate tango in the context of an increasingly rare studio movie that exists for no other purpose than to make people laugh, but it’s one this hilarious new take on the old ZAZ masterpiece pulls off with a rose between its teeth.\"\n\n\n== Future ==\nIn August 2025, producer Erica Huggins said that the actors, writers, and producers were discussing a sequel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSiegel, Alan (July 31, 2025). \"A Naked Attempt at Saving Comedy\".

        "title": "Jurassic World Rebirth",
        "content": "Jurassic World Rebirth is a 2025 American science fiction action film directed by Gareth Edwards and written by David Koepp. It takes place three years after Jurassic World Dominion (2022), and is the fourth Jurassic World film as well as the seventh installment overall in the Jurassic Park franchise. The film stars Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey, Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and Ed Skrein. In Jurassic World Rebirth, the world's dinosaurs live around the equator, which provides the last viable climate for them to survive. A team travels to a former island research facility where the three largest prehistoric animals reside, with the goal of extracting samples that are vital for a heart disease treatment. The team also rescues a shipwrecked family, and both groups struggle to survive after becoming stranded on the island.\nWork on the film began shortly after the release of Jurassic World Dominion, when executive producer Steven Spielberg recruited Koepp to help him develop a new installment in the series. Koepp previously co-wrote the original Jurassic Park film (1993) and wrote its sequel, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). Development of Rebirth was first reported in January 2024. Edwards was hired as director a month later, and casting commenced shortly thereafter. Principal photography took place in Thailand, Malta, and the United Kingdom from June to September 2024.\nJurassic World Rebirth premiered on June 17, 2025, at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London, and was released in the United States and Canada by Universal Pictures on July 2. The film received mixed reviews from critics, though some deemed it an improvement over previous entries. It has grossed $856.8 million worldwide against a budget of $180–$225 million, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2025.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2008, InGen is operating a dinosaur research laboratory on Île Saint-Hubert in the Atlantic Ocean. The site is used for genetic experiments, including transgenic and mutated dinosaurs. One of these creations, a deformed six-limbed Tyrannosaur dubbed \"Distortus rex\", escapes containment. It kills an employee and wreaks havoc, forcing the personnel to abandon the island.\nIn 2025, most of Earth's climate has become inhospitable to sustain the de-extinct dinosaurs. The remaining animals survive in areas around the equator, which resemble the Mesozoic climate, making them no-travel zones.\nMartin Krebs, an executive at pharmaceutical company ParkerGenix, recruits Zora Bennett, an ex-military covert operative, to collaborate with paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis on a top-secret mission. Their goal is to retrieve biomaterial samples from the three largest remaining prehistoric specimens, which hold the key to a new heart disease treatment. In a bar in Suriname, Zora recruits her longtime friend Duncan Kincaid to lead the expedition. He brings boat driver LeClerc, mercenary Nina, and security chief Bobby Atwater.\nThe expedition team sets out to Île Saint-Hubert to extract samples from the aquatic Mosasaurus, terrestrial Titanosaurus, and avian Quetzalcoatlus. Meanwhile, Reuben Delgado is sailing nearby with his daughters Isabella and Teresa, before Teresa leaves for college. Traveling with them is Teresa's boyfriend, Xavier Dobbs, whom Reuben finds obnoxious. The family is shipwrecked by the Mosasaurus and uses a radio to call for help, with the expedition team coming to their rescue.\nThe team soon encounters the Mosasaurus and extracts a sample from it, but the creature returns with a group of Spinosaurus and attacks the ship, killing Bobby. Teresa attempts to use the radio to call for help, but Martin panics and shoves her away to protect the mission's secrecy. Teresa falls overboard after Martin refuses to help her. Xavier jumps overboard to rescue her, followed by Reuben and Isabella, who then separate from the expedition team. The mosasaur forces the ship aground, and Nina is killed onshore by a Spinosaurus. Zora informs the survivors that she employed a rescue helicopter to circle the island in 24 hours.\nThe team locates a Titanosaurus herd in a field and extracts the second sample. Because the Quetzalcoatlus is a large and carnivorous animal, the team hopes to avoid issues by obtaining their final sample from an egg instead. Zora, Henry, and LeClerc rappel to reach a nest located in an ancient temple on the side of a cliff. A parent Quetzalcoatlus returns to the nest and devours LeClerc, but Zora and Henry manage to escape with the sample.\nElsewhere on the island, Reuben commends Xavier for rescuing Teresa. The family searches for the InGen complex and encounters various dinosaurs, including a Mutadon, a mutated raptor/pterosaur hybrid, and an Aquilops, which Isabella adopts and names Dolores. They find a raft and, after surviving a Tyrannosaurus rex attack, proceed down a river.\nAt the complex, the family reunites with the expedition group. When Teresa denounces Martin, he holds the others at gunpoint, takes the samples from Zora, and flees to the helipad alone by UTV. A pack of Mutadons descend on the survivors, who escape through underground tunnels. The rescue helicopter arrives but is destroyed by the Distortus rex, which then devours Martin. The survivors reach a locked gate at the end of the tunnel and see a boat on the other side. Isabella, small enough to fit through the gate, unlocks it, allowing the group to load onto the boat while Duncan diverts the D. rex using a flare.\nZora, Henry, Reuben, Teresa, Xavier, and Isabella escape, and Duncan rejoins them after the D. rex retreats. With the samples in hand, Zora and Henry agree to distribute the new medication without a patent, making it open-source for the entire planet.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nScarlett Johansson as Zora Bennett, a covert operation expert\nMahershala Ali as Duncan Kincaid, Zora's team leader\nJonathan Bailey as Dr. Henry Loomis, a paleontologist\nRupert Friend as Martin Krebs, a pharmaceutical representative\nManuel Garcia-Rulfo as Reuben Delgado, the father of a shipwrecked civilian family\nLuna Blaise as Teresa Delgado, Reuben's eldest daughter\nDavid Iacono as Xavier Dobbs, Teresa's boyfriend\nAudrina Miranda as Isabella Delgado, Reuben's youngest daughter\nEd Skrein as Bobby Atwater, a member of Zora's team\nBechir Sylvain as LeClerc, a member of Zora's team\nPhilippine Velge as Nina, a member of Zora's team\nAdam Loxley as Williams, an InGen scientist on Île Saint-Hubert who became the first victim of Distortus rex\nNiamh Finlay as Desanto\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nDavid Koepp co-wrote the original film, Jurassic Park (1993); he shared screenplay credit with Michael Crichton, who authored the novels Jurassic Park (1990) and The Lost World (1995). Koepp returned as sole writer on the latter's film adaptation The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). Steven Spielberg directed both films and would return as an executive producer for future installments in the Jurassic Park franchise.\nKoepp initially turned down the chance to write another film, believing he had nothing left to contribute to the series. He was still consulted for subsequent films and eventually did uncredited script work on Jurassic World Dominion (2022). Colin Trevorrow spent nine years working on the Jurassic World trilogy as a director and co-writer, and said he would likely not return for another film, except in a possible advisory role. He ultimately had no involvement with Jurassic World Rebirth.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nDevelopment on Jurassic World Rebirth began shortly after the release of Dominion, with an early story idea from Spielberg that features heavily in the final film. Spielberg had brought his idea to Koepp and asked him about writing a new film in the series, which led to an exchange of other ideas. Koepp took on the project upon learning how deeply involved Spielberg would be in crafting it. They worked closely to develop the screenplay over a six-month period, seeking to revive the tone of the original Jurassic Park trilogy, particularly the first film. Koepp also said, \"We decided early on that, because the first and second trilogies have concluded their stories, let's not restrict ourselves in any way – let's have all-new characters in an all-new location.\"\nKoepp wanted to revisit the concept of humans in a dinosaur environment, whereas the two preceding films had shifted toward the animals living among people around the world, of which Koepp said, \"I don't know where else to go with that.\" He felt this idea had been thoroughly explored, furthermore saying, \"Once that happened, you can go anywhere in the world and you can have as many crazy dinosaur situations as you want. I was more limited. I find limitations freeing. [...]. I think we actually had an easier time than the three Jurassic World movies because they got so big and that becomes hard to work with.\"\nKoepp and Spielberg devised a story involving a secret island facility, used for dinosaur research and development, then had to determine why characters would visit such a place. According to Koepp:\n\n\"While doing research, I found that certain dinosaurs, larger ones in particular, did have extraordinarily long lifespans and the reason was they had remarkably low incidences of heart disease. That led to the idea that a drug could be synthesized from their DNA, because the greatest killer of humans is heart disease.\"\nBen Lamm, co-founder of Colossal Biosciences, said the premise is realistic: \"There's hidden cures and hidden data in all these species that we're losing.\" The idea of mutant dinosaurs was inspired by the hybridized dinosaurs in earlier Jurassic World films; Koepp said that he and Spielberg realized the hybrids \"can't all have gone well. This is genetic experimentation. Things are not going to work out sometimes.\" Initially, Koepp planned to feature the character Atwater more heavily, having him eventually partner with Krebs to betray the others.\nBefore writing the script, Koepp rewatched the preceding six films in the franchise. He also reread Crichton's Jurassic Park novels, for the first time in nearly 30 years, incorporating concepts from both books. Rebirth includes a sequence from the first novel that was cut from its film adaptation, in which characters in a raft must escape from a Tyrannosaurus rex. A monologue by the character Henry Loomis was also pulled from the novel, and additionally includes an un-used line of dialogue that Koepp wrote for the character Ian Malcolm in an early draft of Jurassic Park.\nAside from the inclusion of dinosaurs, Koepp had no story requirements to follow in writing the script, although he did compile a list of rules for himself; among these was that the film be based on accurate science, that it not retcon any events from the previous films, and that humorous dialogue be included. He also sought to depict the non-mutant dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters, stating that their actions are driven by either hunger or territorial defense.\nBy September 2023, Koepp had begun writing the screenplay in earnest, turning in a draft three months later. Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, producers of the Jurassic World trilogy, would return for Rebirth. Although another installment was expected at some point, Marshall and Crowley were unaware that Spielberg was already working on the project until the first draft was turned in. With a mid-2025 release date being targeted, the producers were surprised by the limited amount of production time, but they soon determined it to be adequate.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nThe project was unveiled in late January 2024, when it was reported that a new Jurassic World film was in development by Universal Pictures. Like the previous Jurassic World films, the new installment would be produced by Marshall and Crowley through The Kennedy/Marshall Company, while Spielberg would executive produce through Amblin Entertainment. Development of the project had been underway for some time, with several drafts already written by Koepp. The producers had also done some pre-production work, including dinosaur designs, meaning that any creative input from the eventual director would be minimal. The position was reportedly described as being \"more shooter than auteur\", as the producers sought to have more creative control than Jurassic World Dominion, which earned mostly negative reviews.\n\nDavid Leitch, who previously served as a second unit director on Jurassic World, was briefly in talks to direct the film during early February 2024, but negotiations broke down after several days, as the project's progress up to that point left little room for his creative input. Gareth Edwards was announced as director later that month, having been selected because of the visual style he used in his previous films, which was considered ideal for the Jurassic World series. His experience with computer-generated imagery (CGI) was also a factor in his selection. Furthermore, Spielberg enjoyed Edwards' film Godzilla (2014) and Edwards is a fan of the original Jurassic Park.\nAfter completing the film The Creator (2023), Edwards planned to take a break from studio filmmaking to focus on his own projects instead. He was busy writing a new film when he was offered the Jurassic World project, which he described as \"the only movie that would make me drop everything like a stone and dive right in\". Feeling depleted after finishing The Creator, he hoped that Koepp's draft would give him reason to turn down the directing job but was instead won over. He met with Marshall and subsequently Spielberg to discuss the project and possible changes, and was soon hired as director. Edwards had less than a year and a half to get the film finished, a process that he said would normally take two and a half years. Early on, he suggested delaying the film's release, but this idea was immediately rejected. He credited Koepp's script for the quick turnaround: \"Everybody was pointing at that going, 'Go make that; that's what we want.' And so it was just quite a relatively smooth ride\".\nEdwards aimed to follow Koepp's script by maintaining its balance of humor and horror elements, the latter being emphasized more so than in previous Jurassic World films. Koepp encouraged Edwards to make suggestions for improving the script. A scene involving a Quetzalcoatlus nest was among those modified by Edwards; originally written to take place on a cliff, he changed the setting to an abandoned ancient temple. A sequence at a gas station mini mart was initially set in a different location, but was also changed by Edwards. He ultimately found the film's shortened production time to be beneficial: \"If you have too much time, you procrastinate, you try things that don't work\".\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nJurassic World Rebirth is the first film in the series to not include any returning actors from previous installments. Casting was underway in March 2024, and continued over the next three months.\nVarious actors were considered to play Zora, including Jennifer Lawrence, who turned down the role. Scarlett Johansson was already a fan of the franchise and hoped to join it for more than a decade. While Rebirth was in development, she arranged a meeting with Spielberg and pitched the idea of joining the cast in some capacity. Edwards, after signing on as director, learned of Johansson's interest and immediately cast her as Zora. She worked with Koepp to further develop her character.\nJonathan Bailey would also be cast, at the suggestion of Universal executives who were impressed with his performance in the 2024 film Wicked. Edwards cast Manuel Garcia-Rulfo after seeing him in an episode of the television series The Lincoln Lawyer. Likewise, he cast Rupert Friend after being impressed by a performance he gave in an episode of Homeland. Friend worked with Koepp to make his character more dimensional.\nOther actors cast in the film included Mahershala Ali, Luna Blaise, David Iacono, Audrina Miranda, and Béchir Sylvain. Glen Powell, who voiced Dave in the animated series Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous (2020–2022), turned down a role. Powell was reportedly in talks to play Dr. Henry Loomis but declined the role saying, \"There's somebody better that's gonna breathe more life into this, or can do a better job than I can. And you just have to be realistic about that. Sometimes you put yourself out of a job, but that's okay.\"\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nJohn Mathieson served as the cinematographer. Edwards hoped to emulate Spielberg's filmmaking style, and shot the project using 35mm film, his first time doing so, to harken back to the look of the first film. The production used Panaflex Millennium XL2 cameras and vintage C- and E-Series anamorphic lenses from Panavision. Additional equipment included an ARRI 235 camera for handheld photography, and a range of Angénieux and Elite zoom lenses. The E-Series lenses were favored for their cleaner rendering, and scenes were framed in the 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Night scenes in the jungle were primarily shot using day-for-night techniques to reduce lighting complexity in remote locations. Kodak's Vision3 film stock was used for the production and was processed at Kodak Film Lab in the UK. The final digital intermediate grade used a vintage Kodak print emulation LUT, with limited color correction to maintain the natural grain and color of the film scan.\nCosta Rica was strongly considered as a filming location to depict the fictional Île Saint-Hubert, although other possible locations included the Dominican Republic, Mauritius, and Panama. Once Edwards was hired, he suggested shooting in Thailand, where he filmed The Creator. Spielberg and the producers immediately approved the idea, finding the country's landscapes ideal for depicting Île Saint-Hubert. Also filmed in Thailand, at a small fishing village, was a beach bar scene set in Suriname where Zora meets with Duncan. Edwards sought to do as much on-location filming as possible. James Clyne, production designer for The Creator, would join Edwards again for Jurassic World Rebirth. As filming began, Spielberg turned full creative control over to Edwards and was later impressed by the dailies.\nPrincipal photography began in Thailand on June 13, 2024, under the working title Saga, with filming lasting a month in the country. Locations included Khao Phanom Bencha National Park in Krabi, Ko Kradan at Hat Chao Mai National Park in Trang, and Ao Phang Nga National Park in Phang Nga. Sunset Beach on Ko Kradan was used for the scene in which Duncan's boat crashes on Île Saint-Hubert. The Titanosaurus sequence was shot on a field in Thab Prik, located in Krabi. Clyne's team was unsuccessful in growing high grass for the scene, due to a drought, and instead hired a horticulturist from England to achieve this by installing an irrigation system. Shooting in Thailand was made difficult by the presence of venomous water snakes and insects. The use of film also presented a downside, as the dailies had to be shipped to England for processing. According to executive producer Denis Stewart, \"It was five days of wondering if that film was going to get there okay, wondering if we could move on and strike the set and let an actor leave or if we were going to need to reshoot a scene or let it go. But not a single problem arose.\"\nFilming moved to the Malta Film Studios in Kalkara, Malta in July 2024. Filming there included boat attack sequences involving the Mosasaurus. Some of the stunts were filmed in water tanks at the studio site, and ocean shooting took place on the nearby Mediterranean Sea. Complex shots were filmed in the tanks, with boats placed on hydraulic gimbals. These were built by special effects supervisor Neil Corbould, who had worked with Edwards on previous films. Most of the tank sequences were shot without any water, which would be added in later through CGI. Edwards acknowledged that filming the ocean sequences was \"very difficult\". Johansson said, \"There was no escape from the sun. It was just baking every day. And you're on this rig, 30 feet [9 meters] in the air or whatever it is, and it's moving up and down and sideways, and there's all this water being shot out of these cannons towards you. It was brutal.\"\nIn August 2024, filming moved to London and Sky Studios Elstree in the United Kingdom. The InGen facility, including research rooms and a network of tunnels, was constructed on three sound stages at Sky Studios. The laboratory was the most expensive set built for the film. An artificial jungle, the gas station mini mart, and the interiors of Duncan's boat and the ancient temple were among other sets constructed at Sky Studios. Also built there was a 70-foot (21 m) cliff wall for when Zora's team rappels down to the temple. A waterfall was added to this scene through visual effects, using footage of the Jog Falls in Shimoga district, Karnataka, India. A museum scene was shot at the U.K.'s Old Royal Naval College.\nThe start of the T. rex river chase was filmed at a flooded quarry in Thailand, while the remainder was shot in the U.K. at Lee Valley White Water Centre in Hertfordshire. On-set rocks and CGI landscaping would be used for the latter location. Garcia-Rulfo performed several of his own stunts, and he and Iacono learned scuba diving for the aquatic scenes. Friend had to be suspended from a wire for the scene depicting the death of his character, Krebs. Ali's character, Duncan, was originally written to have been killed by the Distortus rex. Once Ali was cast, Universal believed that due to his star status, the character should live. Edwards and Ali successfully pushed for Duncan to die as written, but were later told by Universal to film an additional scene while in Thailand to show that he survived, in the event that such an outcome should be chosen. Edwards ultimately decided to add this additional footage into the final film.\nKoepp was on set in London during the final weeks of filming, and made himself readily available to Edwards before then through text messaging. Edwards requested minor rewrites on several occasions, sometimes minutes before shooting a scene. Filming wrapped on September 27, 2024, although pick-up shots were made in New York City three weeks later.\n\n\n=== Creatures on screen ===\n\nIndustrial Light & Magic (ILM) returned from previous installments to handle the CGI for dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals featured in the film. Because of its limited pre-production period, the Jurassic World Rebirth crew did not have time to make heavy usage of animatronics, marking a departure from the film's two predecessors. However, on-set materials were still used to aid the actors. John Nolan returned from Jurassic World Dominion to build practical dinosaur parts, including heads, limbs and claws. These were primarily used as lighting and eyeline references, and would be replaced with CGI dinosaur models in post-production, as Edwards sought to maintain design consistency by avoiding an on-screen combination of production methods. Unlike previous films, ILM had only six weeks to finalize the dinosaur designs for Rebirth as a result of its truncated pre-production. Paleontologist Stephen L. Brusatte returned from Dominion as a dinosaur consultant. Edwards chose not to include feathered dinosaurs because he thought they \"looked like big chickens and weren't all that scary,\" according to ILM's visual effects supervisor David Vickery.\nIn the film, it is stated that public interest in dinosaurs has decreased. Metaphorically, Edwards viewed the animals somewhat like films, referencing the decline of movie theaters and the rise of streaming platforms. He saw the mutant dinosaur storyline as \"some strange version of the situation we're in as filmmakers, where, like, how do you get people excited about this stuff again?\"\nThe design of the Distortus rex was inspired by the xenomorphs in the Alien franchise and the rancors in the Star Wars franchise. With its bulbous head, Vickery stated, \"It's as if another animal has been wrapped around the T-Rex. Gareth wanted us to feel sorry for it as well as terrified, because its deformities have caused it some pain, and there's an encumbrance to it.\" Edwards was heavily involved in the design of the Distortus rex, whose traits include gorilla-like arms and movements at his suggestion.\nAnother type of mutant animal, the flying Mutadons, are a combination of a pterosaur and Velociraptor. They were inspired by an encounter that Koepp had with a bat on his porch. Koepp described the Mutadons as a failed early attempt by InGen to create hybridized dinosaurs. The Mutadons underwent many design changes, some depicting the creature with multiple heads and varying limb configurations, as ILM sought to maintain a balance between science fiction and believability. The final design was selected around the end of 2024, after nine months.\nTo establish the film's Tyrannosaurus as a different individual than the ones depicted in the previous installments, the dinosaur was redesigned to draw influence from the 1969 film The Valley of Gwangi. Vickery described it as \"a healthier, heavier, more muscular, more bull-like\" animal, while retaining the typical look of a Jurassic Park T. rex. The raft sequence proved challenging for ILM as the team had to determine how the animal would move while it is underwater.\nRebirth includes the return of Spinosaurus, a dinosaur previously featured in the film Jurassic Park III (2001), of which Edwards is a fan. For Rebirth, the Spinosaurus was redesigned to reflect newer research which determined the animal to be primarily semiaquatic. According to Vickery, \"We've given it more powerful hind limbs, a much bigger, broader tail, webbing in between its feet, and the appearance of a shorter more powerful neck by adding fatty deposits and extra skin folds.\" To determine the design and behavior of the Spinosaurus, ILM studied crocodiles and grizzly bears. Mosasaurus also received a new design. To emphasize its sense of scale, the Mosasaurus goes through many size changes over the course of the film, more so than any other creature.\nOther returning species include Apatosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Compsognathus, Dilophosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Pteranodon, and Quetzalcoatlus. Like all previous installments, the film also features the return of Velociraptor, albeit in a brief scene establishing the Mutadons as a deadlier threat. Velociraptor received a new design inspired by the raptors in Jurassic Park III.\nNew species include creatures such as Titanosaurus and the pterosaur Anurognathus. Nature videos of giraffes and swans were studied for a scene depicting Titanosaurus mating rituals, and an elephant was brought on to walk through the grass field in Thailand as a reference for the CGI artists.\nOne of the primary dinosaurs, also new to the film series, is Aquilops. The production used three on-set animatronics, each measuring 18 inches in length and operated remotely by a team of puppeteers. The primary animatronic had numerous motors to simulate movements such as breathing, blinking, and tail wagging. This was used for close interactions with the cast, while another animatronic was used in scenes where characters pick the creature up, and a third was used for lighting reference. Because of their abundant use of 3D-printed parts, these puppets weighed less than typical animatronics.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nBy the end of 2024, Edwards had finished his first cut of Jurassic World Rebirth. He wanted the film to be under two hours in length, and his cut was one minute below this mark, excluding the credits. Edwards removed five minutes to achieve this, but ultimately restored the footage at the request of Universal executives. Three other scenes are absent from the final theatrical cut, two of which Edwards was fine with removing. The third consisted of additional material for the gas station sequence; he described it as \"a little bit more like being hunted. The tension of something coming.\" It was cut because it slowed down the film's third act, which was written to be fast-paced. According to Edwards, the best advice that Spielberg gave him was to reduce sequences during post-production: \"He was saying, 'It's like a meal. The best version is [consumers] leave just slightly hungry, then they'll get back in the queue and do it all over again.\"\nWhile in post-production, Edwards briefly considered the idea of having a T. rex show up in the ending to battle the Distortus rex and inadvertently save the humans. Other filmmakers on the project rejected this idea for lack of originality, noting that previous installments in the series already ended with a dinosaur battle. The film already had numerous Easter eggs referencing the original Jurassic Park. Upon seeing an early cut of Rebirth, Spielberg and Koepp requested that these references be removed entirely, although Edwards was ultimately allowed to keep most of them. Among the exceptions was Mr. DNA, an animated character in the original film, who was cut from an exposition scene in Rebirth.\nBy March 2025, Edwards was working seven days a week with ILM and film editor Jabez Olssen to have the project finished in time for its release. In total, Jurassic World Rebirth contains 1,515 visual effects shots, the most of any film in the Jurassic series. ILM completed over 1,000 of those shots and the rest were done by other vendors including Important Looking Pirates (ILP) and Midas. The film was completed in May 2025.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nJurassic World Rebirth was scored by Alexandre Desplat, reuniting with Edwards after Godzilla and further replacing Michael Giacchino, who composed the previous installments in the Jurassic World series. Recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London, with a 105-piece orchestra and a 60-piece choir, the score incorporates previous musical themes by John Williams, who composed the scores for the first two Jurassic Park films. Bailey performed the clarinet solo. The soundtrack was released by Back Lot Music on July 2, 2025, simultaneous with the film.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe film's title and a pair of first-look photos were unveiled on August 29, 2024. Jurassic World Rebirth was promoted as an homage to the first Jurassic Park and was marketed toward fans of that film. The first trailer was released on February 5, 2025, preceded by multiple film stills. Discussing the trailer, Ben Travis of Empire felt the film was \"visually stunning\" and reminiscent of the first Jurassic Park. A 60-second TV spot was broadcast at Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025. The second trailer was released on May 20, 2025.\nMattel and Lego produced a line of film-based toys as part of the promotional campaign. Other marketing partners included 7-Eleven (including Speedway and Stripes) and Funko. Professional basketball player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander also appeared in a television commercial that aired during the 2025 NBA playoffs. Universal wanted Johansson to join the social media website Instagram to promote Jurassic World Rebirth, but she declined, believing the film would be successful without her doing so. She did appear in an online video to promote the Mattel toyline.\n\n\n== Release ==\nJurassic World Rebirth premiered on June 17, 2025, at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London. Universal released the film in the United States on July 2, 2025.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nAs part of a long-term deal with Amazon Prime Video for Universal's live-action films, the film will first stream on Peacock for the first four months of the pay-TV window, before moving to Prime Video for the next 10, and returning to Peacock for the remaining four.\nJurassic World Rebirth was released on digital download on August 5, 2025, and will be released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on September 9, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of September 2, 2025, Jurassic World: Rebirth has grossed $338.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $518.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $856.8 million.\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\nThe Hollywood Reporter initially projected a $100–125 million 5-day opening weekend in the United States and Canada while Deadline Hollywood projected $115–135 million. In the week of release, Deadline Hollywood projected an estimation of around $260 million global opening, with a domestic 5-day gross of $120–130 million. On July 5, 2025, the film was projected to make $312 million worldwide during its 5-day opening weekend.\nThe film would make $30.5 million in its opening day, which led to projections for its 5-day opening weekend increasing to at least $133.5 million. It then made $25.3 million the next day, which resulted in the opening weekend prediction being revised to $137.5 million.\nOn July 4, it made $26.3 million at the domestic box office, which resulted in Deadline Hollywood revising its five-day domestic opening weekend box growth estimate to $141.2 million.\nOn July 5, it made $35.6 million domestically, which resulted in Deadline Hollywood increasing its 5-day opening weekend projection to $145.3 million. It ended up debuting to $147.8 million over the five-day Fourth of July holiday, topping the box office, including $92 million for the three-day weekend, and $322.6 million worldwide during this time as well.\nIn its second weekend, the film made $40.3 million, a 56.2% decline, finishing in second place behind newcomer Superman.\n\n\n==== International ====\nIn India, the film set a franchise record by having the highest day one gross without any premieres. The film's highest-grossing territories include China ($41 million), the United Kingdom ($16.6 million), Mexico ($13.9 million), and Germany ($7.6 million).\nShortly after completing a full week, the film would gross just under $410 million worldwide. The film would remain atop of the Chinese box office during its second weekend, grossing $11.1 million.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 51% of 387 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Going back to basics with rip-roaring set pieces and fossilized clichés, Jurassic World Rebirth doesn't evolve this prehistoric franchise but does restore some of its most reliable DNA.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 50 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nEarly reactions to the film by critics was mixed. Peter Debruge of Variety felt that Rebirth \"offers an updated version of the same basic ride Spielberg offered 32 years earlier, and yet, it hardly feels essential to the series' overall mythology, nor does it signal where the franchise could be headed.\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"Edwards clearly is a devoted Spielberg fan, embedding subtle homages throughout, notably in the open water sequences that recall Jaws. Jurassic World Rebirth is unlikely to top anyone's ranked franchise list. But longtime fans should have a blast.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote: \"The latest installment marks a return to form after some recent duds, with all the expected Spielberg-style set pieces and excellent romantic chemistry between the leads\". Bill Bria of TheWrap wrote: \"Jurassic has to live with setting a high bar, of course — the original film revolutionized the industry, a status that Rebirth is all too aware of, as seen in its meta theme of dinosaurs becoming old news to a jaded populace. Yet just because cheeseburgers are now available anywhere doesn't mean that they can't be damn tasty. Jurassic Park Rebirth is just a well made cheeseburger, and whether that's filling and interesting enough is up to your own appetite.\" Peter Hammond of Deadline Hollywood wrote: \"It might sound like a challenge to believe these humans would sign up to visit a forbidden jungle for guaranteed encounters with truly frightening and gigantic creatures out of another time in order to essentially get blood samples, but if you are game to go with that premise, a good time will be had for all.\" Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph awarded Rebirth a perfect five stars and called it the best film in the series since the original. He also praised the film's visual and sound design, calling it the best-looking and best-sounding since the first film.\nEmpire-based critic Ian Freer stated: \"It's not doing much daring or different but this delivers a fun, well-made summer theme-park ride, with fast highs and slow lows. Pleasurable, though it doesn't linger.\" Caryn James of BBC stated that Rebirth \"follows the template created by the original Jurassic Park – but it's no match for it\" and considered it the weakest in the franchise. Alison Wilmore of Vulture stated that \"Audiences may not have run out of enthusiasm for what the Jurassic Worlds are selling, or at least they haven't yet, but the people tasked with making them sure are out of ideas. Rebirth, as though fulfilling its franchise's own prophecy, really does manage to be boring.\"\nMeagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting wrote: \"Jurassic World Rebirth takes a step in the right direction, but the previous trilogy backed this franchise so thoroughly into a corner that it may be time to let this series go extinct.\" David Jenkins of Little White Lies wrote: \"Edwards's involvement was the one thing keeping the candle aflame in terms of our hopes that this moribund, never-ending franchise might have turned a corner. Yet even working at full pelt, there's just too much that's wrong and silly and derivative about this tired, tired run-out. The actors are competent; there are a few tasty zingers; the effects are seamless. But the whole enterprise just feels like the same thing we've seen over and over again, and that the addition of a 'new hat' has been deemed more of an irritant than a gift to create something fresh.\" Siddhant Adlakha of Inverse wrote: \"Rebirth has nothing truly new, and it seldom presents anything old with ingenuity or with a mischievous spark. It should, in that case, come as a relief that it has only nominal connections to the rest of the series.\"\nChristy Lemire of RogerEbert.com wrote: \"There are some sporadic joys here in the clever sight gags, the sleight of hand, the bait and switch. These moments remind us of the mindless summertime excitement the Jurassic movies have long provided, albeit with diminishing returns. But that giant footprint just isn't as imposing as it used to be.\" Chris Bumbray of JoBlo.com wrote: \"One of the summer's bigger disappointments, Jurassic World: Rebirth might finally prove that this is a franchise in need of a long break.\" Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times was critical of the film, calling it \"a straight monster movie with zero awe or prestige.\"\nCritics from the Los Angeles Times, Cracked.com, El País, and Pajiba found the film's overt product placement from such brands as Snickers and Heineken to be distracting.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films featuring dinosaurs\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nJurassic World Rebirth at IMDb",

        "title": "Ansel Adams",
        "content": "Ansel Easton Adams (February 20, 1902 – April 22, 1984) was an American landscape photographer and environmentalist known for his black-and-white images of the American West. He helped found Group f/64, an association of photographers advocating \"pure\" photography which favored sharp focus and the use of the full tonal range of a photograph. He and Fred Archer developed a system of image-making called the Zone System, a method of achieving a desired final print through a technical understanding of how the tonal range of an image is the result of choices made in exposure, negative development, and printing.\nAdams was a life-long advocate for environmental conservation, and his photographic practice was deeply entwined with this advocacy. At age 14, he was given his first camera during his first visit to Yosemite National Park. He developed his early photographic work as a member of the Sierra Club. He was later contracted with the United States Department of the Interior to make photographs of national parks. For his work and his persistent advocacy, which helped expand the National Park system, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1980.\nIn the founding and establishment of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, an important landmark in securing photography's institutional legitimacy, Adams was a key advisor. He assisted the staging of that department's first photography exhibition, helped to found the photography magazine Aperture, and co-founded the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Birth ===\nAdams was born in the Fillmore District of San Francisco, the only child of Charles Hitchcock Adams and Olive Bray. He was named after his uncle, Ansel Easton. His mother's family came from Baltimore, where his maternal grandfather had a successful freight-hauling business but lost his wealth investing in failed mining and real estate ventures in Nevada. The Adams family came from New England, having migrated from the north of Ireland during the early 19th century. His paternal grandfather founded a very prosperous lumber business that his father later managed. Later in life, Adams condemned the industry his grandfather worked in for cutting down many of the redwood forests.\n\n\n=== Early childhood ===\nOne of Adams's earliest memories was watching the smoke from the fires caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Then four years old, Adams was uninjured in the initial shaking but was tossed face-first into a garden wall during an aftershock three hours later, breaking and scarring his nose. A doctor recommended that his nose be reset once he reached maturity, but it remained crooked and necessitated mouth breathing for the rest of his life.\nIn 1907, his family moved 2 miles (3 km) west to a new home near the Seacliff neighborhood of San Francisco, just south of the Presidio Army Base. The home had a \"splendid view\" of the Golden Gate and the Marin Headlands.\nAdams was a hyperactive child and prone to frequent sickness and hypochondria. He had few friends, but his family home and surroundings on the heights facing the Golden Gate provided ample childhood activities. He had little patience for games or sports, but he enjoyed the beauty of nature from an early age, collecting bugs and exploring Lobos Creek all the way to Baker Beach and the sea cliffs leading to Lands End, \"San Francisco's wildest and rockiest coast, a place strewn with shipwrecks and rife with landslides.\"\n\n\n=== Early education ===\nAdams's father had a three-inch telescope, and they enthusiastically shared the hobby of astronomy, visiting the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton together. His father later served as the paid secretary-treasurer of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, from 1925 to 1950.\nCharles Adams's business suffered large financial losses after the death of his father in the aftermath of the Panic of 1907. Some of the loss was due to his uncle Ansel Easton and Cedric Wright's father George secretly having sold their shares of the company, \"knowingly providing the controlling interest\" to the Hawaiian Sugar Trust for a large amount of money. By 1912, the family's standard of living had dropped sharply.\nAdams was dismissed from several private schools for being restless and inattentive, so when he was 12, his father decided to remove him from school. For the next two years he was educated by private tutors, his aunt Mary, and his father. Mary was a devotee of Robert G. Ingersoll, a 19th-century agnostic and women's suffrage advocate, so Ingersoll's teachings were important to his upbringing. During the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in 1915, his father insisted that he spend part of each day studying the exhibits as part of his education. He eventually resumed, and completed, his formal education by attending the Mrs. Kate M. Wilkins Private School, graduating from the eighth grade on June 8, 1917. During his later years, he displayed his diploma in the guest bathroom of his home.\nHis father raised him to follow the ideas of Ralph Waldo Emerson: to live a modest, moral life guided by a social responsibility to man and nature. Adams had a loving relationship with his father, but he had a distant relationship with his mother, who did not approve of his interest in photography. The day after her death in 1950, Ansel had a dispute with the undertaker when choosing the casket in which to bury her. He chose the cheapest in the room, a $260 coffin that seemed the least he could purchase without doing the job himself. The undertaker remarked, \"Have you no respect for the dead?\" Adams replied, \"One more crack like that and I will take Mama elsewhere.\"\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nAdams became interested in playing the piano at age 12 after hearing his 16-year-old neighbor Henry Cowell play on the Adams's piano, and he taught himself to play and read music. Cowell, who later became a well-known avant-garde composer, gave Adams some lessons. Over the next decade, three music teachers pushed him to develop technique and discipline, and he became determined to pursue a career as a classical pianist.\n\nAdams first visited Yosemite National Park in 1916 with his family. He wrote of his first view of the valley: \"the splendor of Yosemite burst upon us and it was glorious.... One wonder after another descended upon us.... There was light everywhere.... A new era began for me.\" His father gave him his first camera during that stay, an Eastman Kodak Brownie box camera, and he took his first photographs with his \"usual hyperactive enthusiasm\". He returned to Yosemite on his own the next year with better cameras and a tripod. During the winters of 1917 and 1918, he learned basic darkroom technique while working part-time for a San Francisco photograph finisher.\nAdams contracted the Spanish flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, from which he needed several weeks to recuperate. He read a book about lepers and became obsessed with cleanliness; he was afraid to touch anything without immediately washing his hands afterwards. Over the objections of his doctor, he prevailed on his parents to take him back to Yosemite, and the visit cured him of his disease and compulsions.\nAdams avidly read photography magazines, attended camera club meetings, and went to photography and art exhibits. He explored the High Sierra during summer and winter with retired geologist and amateur ornithologist Francis Holman, whom he called \"Uncle Frank\". Holman taught him camping and climbing; however, their shared ignorance of safe climbing techniques such as belaying almost led to disaster on more than one occasion.\n\nWhile in Yosemite, Adams had need of a piano to practice on. A ranger introduced him to landscape painter Harry Best, who kept a studio home in Yosemite and lived there during the summers. Best allowed Adams to practice on his old square piano. Adams grew interested in Best's daughter Virginia and later married her. On her father's death in 1936, Virginia inherited the studio and continued to operate it until 1971. The studio is now known as the Ansel Adams Gallery and remains owned by the Adams family.\n\n\n=== Sierra Club and piano work ===\nAt age 17, Adams joined the Sierra Club, a group dedicated to protecting the wild places of the earth, and he was hired as the summer caretaker of the Sierra Club visitor facility in Yosemite Valley, the LeConte Memorial Lodge, from 1920 to 1923. He remained a member throughout his lifetime and served as a director, as did his wife. He was first elected to the Sierra Club's board of directors in 1934 and served on the board for 37 years. Adams participated in the club's annual High Trips, later becoming assistant manager and official photographer for the trips. He is credited with several first ascents in the Sierra Nevada.\nDuring his twenties, most of his friends had musical associations, particularly violinist and amateur photographer Cedric Wright, who became his best friend as well as his philosophical and cultural mentor. Their shared philosophy was from Edward Carpenter's Towards Democracy, a literary work which endorsed the pursuit of beauty in life and art. For several years, Adams carried a pocket edition with him while at Yosemite; and it became his personal philosophy as well. He later stated, \"I believe in beauty. I believe in stones and water, air and soil, people and their future and their fate.\"\nDuring summer, Adams would enjoy a life of hiking, camping, and photographing; and the rest of the year he worked to improve his piano playing, perfecting his piano technique and musical expression. He also gave piano lessons for extra income that allowed him to purchase a grand piano suitable to his musical ambitions. Adams was still planning a career in music. He felt that his small hands limited his repertoire, but qualified judges considered him a gifted pianist. However, when he formed the Milanvi Trio with a violinist and a dancer, he proved a poor accompanist. It took seven more years for him to conclude that, at best, he might become only a concert pianist of limited range, an accompanist, or a piano teacher.\n\n\n== Photographic career ==\n\n\n=== 1920s ===\n\n\n==== Pictorialism ====\n\nAdams's first photographs were published in 1921, and Best's Studio began selling his Yosemite prints the next year. His early photos already showed careful composition and sensitivity to tonal balance. In letters and cards to family, he wrote of having dared to climb to the best viewpoints and to brave the worst elements.\nDuring the mid-1920s, the fashion in photography was pictorialism, which strove to imitate paintings with soft focus, diffused light, and other techniques. Adams experimented with such techniques, as well as the bromoil process, which involved brushing an oily ink onto the paper. An example is Lodgepole Pines, Lyell Fork of the Merced River, Yosemite National Park (originally named Tamarack Pine), taken in 1921. Adams used a soft-focus lens, \"capturing a glowing luminosity that captured the mood of a magical summer afternoon\".\nFor a short time Adams used hand-coloring, but declared in 1923 that he would do this no longer. By 1925 he had rejected pictorialism altogether for a more realistic approach that relied on sharp focus, heightened contrast, precise exposure, and darkroom craftsmanship.\n\n\n==== Monolith ====\n\nIn 1927, Adams began working with Albert M. Bender, a San Francisco insurance magnate and arts patron. Bender helped Adams produce his first portfolio in his new style, Parmelian Prints of the High Sierras, which included his famous image Monolith, the Face of Half Dome, which was taken with his Korona view camera, using glass plates and a dark red filter (to heighten the tonal contrasts). On that excursion, he had only one plate left, and he \"visualized\" the effect of the blackened sky before risking the last image. He later said, \"I had been able to realize a desired image: not the way the subject appeared in reality but how it felt to me and how it must appear in the finished print.\" One biographer calls Monolith Adams's most significant photograph because the \"extreme manipulation of tonal values\" was a departure from all previous photography. Adams's concept of visualization, which he first defined in print in 1934, became a core principle in his photography.\nAdams's first portfolio was a success, earning nearly $3,900 with the sponsorship and promotion of Bender. Soon he received commercial assignments to photograph the wealthy patrons who bought his portfolio. He also began to understand how important it was that his carefully crafted photos were reproduced to best effect. At Bender's invitation, he joined the Roxburghe Club, an association devoted to fine printing and high standards in book arts. He learned much about printing techniques, inks, design, and layout, which he later applied to other projects.\nAdams married Virginia Best in 1928, after a pause from 1925 to 1926 during which he had brief relationships with various women. The newlyweds moved in with his parents to save expenses. The following year, they had a home built next door and connected it to the older house by a hallway.\n\n\n=== 1930s ===\n\n\n==== Pure photography ====\n\nBetween 1929 and 1942, Adams's work matured, and he became more established. The 1930s were a particularly experimental and productive time for him. He expanded the technical range of his works, emphasizing detailed close-ups as well as large forms, from mountains to factories.\nBender took Adams on visits to Taos, New Mexico, where Adams met and made friends with the poet Robinson Jeffers, artists John Marin and Georgia O'Keeffe, and photographer Paul Strand. His talkative, high-spirited nature combined with his excellent piano playing made him popular among his artist friends. His first book, Taos Pueblo, was published in 1930 with text by writer Mary Hunter Austin.\nStrand proved especially influential. Adams was impressed by the simplicity and detail of Strand's negatives, which showed a style that ran counter to the soft-focus, impressionistic pictorialism still popular at the time. Strand shared secrets of his technique with Adams and convinced him to pursue photography fully. One of Strand's suggestions that Adams adopted was to use glossy paper to intensify tonal values.\nAdams put on his first solo museum exhibition, Pictorial Photographs of the Sierra Nevada Mountains by Ansel Adams, at the Smithsonian Institution in 1931; it featured 60 prints taken in the High Sierra and the Canadian Rockies. He received a favorable review from the Washington Post: \"His photographs are like portraits of the giant peaks, which seem to be inhabited by mythical gods.\"\nDespite his success, Adams felt that he was not yet up to the standards of Strand. He decided to broaden his subject matter to include still life and close-up photos and to achieve higher quality by \"visualizing\" each image before taking it. He emphasized the use of small apertures and long exposures in natural light, which created sharp details with a wide range of distances in focus, as demonstrated in Rose and Driftwood (1933), one of his finest still-life photographs.\nIn 1932, Adams had a group show at the M. H. de Young Museum with Imogen Cunningham and Edward Weston, and they soon formed Group f/64 which espoused \"pure or straight photography\" over pictorialism (f/64 being a very small aperture setting that gives great depth of field). The group's manifesto stated: \"Pure photography is defined as possessing no qualities of technique, composition or idea, derivative of any other art form.\"\nImitating the example of photographer Alfred Stieglitz, Adams opened his own art and photography gallery in San Francisco in 1933. He also began to publish essays in photography magazines and wrote his first instructional book, Making a Photograph, in 1935.\n\n\n==== Sierra Nevada ====\n\nDuring the summers, Adams often participated in Sierra Club High Trips outings, as a paid photographer for the group; and the rest of the year a core group of Club members socialized regularly in San Francisco and Berkeley. In 1933, his first child Michael was born, followed by Anne two years later.\nDuring the 1930s, Adams began to deploy his photographs in the cause of wilderness preservation. He was inspired partly by the increasing incursion into Yosemite Valley of commercial development, including a pool hall, bowling alley, golf course, shops, and automobile traffic. He created the limited-edition book Sierra Nevada: The John Muir Trail in 1938, as part of the Sierra Club's efforts to secure the designation of Kings Canyon as a national park. This book and his testimony before Congress played a vital role in the success of that effort, and Congress designated Kings Canyon as a national park in 1940.\nIn 1935, Adams created many new photographs of the Sierra Nevada; and one of his most famous, Clearing Winter Storm, depicted the entire Yosemite Valley, just as a winter storm abated, leaving a fresh coat of snow. He gathered his recent work and had a solo show at Stieglitz's \"An American Place\" gallery in New York in 1936. The exhibition proved successful with both the critics and the buying public, and earned Adams strong praise from the revered Stieglitz. The following year, the negative for Clearing Winter Storm was almost destroyed when the darkroom in Yosemite caught fire. With the help of Edward Weston and Charis Wilson (Weston's future wife), Adams put out the fire, but thousands of negatives, including hundreds that had never been printed, were lost.\n\n\n==== Desert Southwest ====\n\nIn 1937, Adams, O'Keeffe, and friends organized a month-long camping trip in Arizona, with Orville Cox, the head wrangler at Ghost Ranch, as their guide. Both artists created new work during this trip. Adams made a candid portrait of O'Keeffe with Cox on the rim of Canyon de Chelly. Adams once remarked, \"Some of my best photographs have been made in and on the rim of [that] canyon.\" Their works set in the desert Southwest are often published and exhibited together.\nDuring the rest of the 1930s, Adams took on many commercial assignments to supplement the income from the struggling Best's Studio. He depended on such assignments financially until the 1970s. Some of his clients included Kodak, Fortune magazine, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, AT&T, and the American Trust Company. He photographed Timothy L. Pflueger's new Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel in 1939. The same year, he was named an editor of U.S. Camera & Travel, the most popular photography magazine at that time.\n\n\n=== 1940s ===\n\nIn 1940, Adams created A Pageant of Photography, the largest and most important photography show in the West to date, attended by millions of visitors. With his wife, Adams completed a children's book and the very successful Illustrated Guide to Yosemite Valley during 1940 and 1941. He also taught photography by giving workshops in Detroit. Adams also began his first serious stint of teaching, which included the training of military photographers, in 1941 at the Art Center School of Los Angeles, now known as the Art Center College of Design.\n\n\n==== Mural Project ====\nIn 1941, Adams contracted with the National Park Service to make photographs of National Parks, Indian reservations, and other locations managed by the department, for use as mural-sized prints to decorate the department's new building. The contract was for 180 days. Adams set off on a road trip with his friend Cedric and his son Michael, intending to combine work on the \"Mural Project\" with commissions for the U.S. Potash Company and Standard Oil, with some days reserved for personal work.\n\n\n==== Moonrise ====\n\nWhile in New Mexico for the project, Adams photographed a scene of the Moon rising above a modest village with snow-covered mountains in the background, under a dominating black sky. The photograph is one of his most famous and is named Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico. Adams's description in his later books of how it was made probably enhanced the photograph's fame: the light on the crosses in the foreground was rapidly fading, and he could not find his exposure meter; however, he remembered the luminance of the Moon and used it to calculate the proper exposure. In the resulting negative the foreground was underexposed, the highlights in the clouds were quite dense, and the negative proved difficult to print. The initial publication of Moonrise was in U.S. Camera 1943 annual, after being selected by the \"photo judge\" for U.S. Camera, Edward Steichen. This gave Moonrise an audience before its first formal exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1944.\nOver nearly 40 years, Adams re-interpreted the image, his most popular by far, using the latest darkroom equipment at his disposal, making over 1,369 unique prints, mostly in 16\" by 20\" format. Many of the prints were made during the 1970s, with their sale finally giving Adams financial independence from commercial projects. The total value of these original prints exceeds $25,000,000; the highest price paid for a single print of Moonrise reached $609,600 at a 2006 Sotheby's auction in New York.\nThe Mural Project ended on June 30, 1942; and because of the World War, the murals were never created. Adams sent a total of 225 small prints to the DOI, but held on to the 229 negatives. These include many famous images such as The Tetons and the Snake River. Although they were legally the property of the U.S. Government, he knew that the National Archives did not take proper care of photographic material, and used various subterfuges to evade queries.\nThe ownership of one image in particular has attracted interest: Moonrise. Although Adams kept meticulous records of his travel and expenses, he was less disciplined about recording the dates of his images, and he neglected to note the date of Moonrise. But the position of the Moon allowed the image to be eventually dated from astronomical calculations, and in 1991 Dennis di Cicco of Sky & Telescope determined that Moonrise was made on November 1, 1941. Since this was a day for which he had not billed the department, the image belonged to Adams.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\n\nWhen Edward Steichen formed his Naval Aviation Photographic Unit in early 1942, he wanted Adams to be a member, to build and direct a state-of-the-art darkroom and laboratory in Washington, D.C. Around February 1942, Steichen asked Adams to join him in the navy. Adams agreed, but with two conditions: He wanted to be commissioned as an officer, and he would not be available until July 1. Steichen, who wanted the team assembled as quickly as possible, passed on Adams and had his other photographers ready by early April.\nAdams was distressed by the Japanese American internment that occurred after the Pearl Harbor attack. He requested permission to visit the Manzanar War Relocation Center in the Owens Valley, at the base of Mount Williamson. The resulting photo-essay first appeared in a Museum of Modern Art exhibit, and later was published as Born Free and Equal: The Story of Loyal Japanese-Americans. Upon its release, \"[the book] was met with some distressing resistance and was rejected by many as disloyal.\" This work was a significant departure, stylistically and philosophically, from the work for which Adams is generally known. He also contributed to the war effort by doing many photographic assignments for the military, including making prints of secret Japanese installations in the Aleutians.\nIn 1943, Adams had a camera platform mounted on his station wagon, to afford him a better vantage point over the immediate foreground and a better angle for expansive backgrounds. Most of his landscapes from that time forward were made from the roof of his car rather than from summits reached by rugged hiking, as in his earlier days.\nAdams was the recipient of three Guggenheim Fellowships during his career, the first being awarded in 1946 to photograph every national park. At that time, there were 28 national parks, and Adams photographed 27 of them, missing only Everglades National Park in Florida. This series of photographs produced memorable images of Old Faithful Geyser, Grand Teton, and Mount McKinley.\nIn 1945, Adams was asked to form the first fine art photography department at the California School of Fine Arts. Adams invited Dorothea Lange, Imogen Cunningham, and Edward Weston to be guest lecturers, and Minor White to be the principal instructor. The photography department produced numerous notable photographers, including Philip Hyde, Benjamen Chinn, and Bill Heick.\n\n\n=== 1950s ===\nIn 1952 Adams was one of the founders of the magazine Aperture, which was intended as a serious journal of photography, displaying its best practitioners and newest innovations. He was also a contributor to Arizona Highways, a photo-rich travel magazine. His article on Mission San Xavier del Bac, with text by longtime friend Nancy Newhall, was enlarged into a book published in 1954. This was the first of many collaborations with her.\nIn June 1955, Adams began his annual workshops at Yosemite. They continued to 1981, attracting thousands of students. He continued with commercial assignments for another twenty years, and became a consultant, with a monthly retainer, for Polaroid Corporation, which was founded by good friend Edwin Land. He made thousands of photographs with Polaroid products, El Capitan, Winter, Sunrise (1968) being the one he considered most memorable. During the final twenty years of his life, the 6x6 cm medium format Hasselblad was his camera of choice, with Moon and Half Dome (1960) being his favorite photograph made with that brand of camera.\nFrom 1957 until 1962, Geraldine \"Gerry\" Sharpe served as his photography assistant, and they often took photos of the same locations.\nAdams published his fourth portfolio, What Majestic Word, in 1963, and dedicated it to the memory of his Sierra Club friend Russell Varian, who was a co-inventor of the klystron and who had died in 1959. The title was taken from the poem \"Sand Dunes\", by John Varian, Russell's father, and the fifteen photographs were accompanied by the writings of both John and Russell Varian. Russell's widow, Dorothy, wrote the preface, and explained that the photographs were selected to serve as interpretations of the character of Russell Varian.\n\n\n== Later career ==\n\nBy the 1960s, Adams had developed gout and arthritis and hoped that moving to a new home would make him feel better. He and his wife considered Santa Fe, but they both had commitments in California (Virginia was managing the Yosemite studio of her father). A friend offered to sell them property in Carmel Highlands, overlooking the Big Sur coastline. With architect Eldridge Spencer, they began planning the new home in 1961 and moved there in 1965. Adams began to devote much of his time to printing the backlog of negatives that had accumulated over forty years.\nIn the 1960s, a few mainstream art galleries that had considered photography unworthy of exhibit alongside fine paintings decided to show Adams's images, particularly the former Kenmore Gallery in Philadelphia. In March 1963, Ansel Adams and Nancy Newhall accepted a commission from Clark Kerr, the president of the University of California, to produce a series of photographs of the university's campuses to commemorate its centennial celebration. The collection, titled Fiat Lux after the university's motto, was published in 1967 and now resides in the Museum of Photography at the University of California, Riverside. The collection was republished in book form by UCI in 1991, recreated in part by UCLA-based photographer Kevin Cooley in 2014, and exhibited in part at UCR in 2025.\nAdams was the recipient of three Guggenheim Fellowships during his career, the first being awarded in 1946 to photograph every national park. At that time, there were 28 national parks, and Adams photographed 27 of them, missing only Everglades National Park in Florida. This series of photographs produced memorable images of Old Faithful Geyser, Grand Teton, and Mount McKinley. Beyond the western national parks, Adams also extensively photographed the New England coast from Connecticut to Maine, the only coastal location outside of California that he photographed steadily over decades. His 1949 photograph \"The Atlantic, Schoodic Point, Acadia National Park, Maine\" became part of his Portfolio Two: The National Parks and Monuments.\nDuring the 1970s, Adams reprinted negatives from his vault, in part to satisfy the demand of art museums that had recently established departments of photography.\nIn 1972, Adams contributed images to help publicize Proposition 20, which authorized the state to regulate development along portions of the California coast.\nIn 1974, he exhibited at the Rencontres d'Arles (formerly known as the Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie d'Arles), an annual summer photography festival in France. He also had a major retrospective exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nIn 1975, he cofounded the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona, which handles some of his estate matters.\nIn 1979, President Jimmy Carter commissioned Adams to make the first official photographic portrait of a U.S. president. During this occasion, Adams gave Carter a letter containing two memoranda. One advocated placing Big Sur under federal protection. The other argued for stronger legislation for protecting Alaskan wilderness.\n\n\n=== Death and legacy ===\nAdams died from cardiovascular disease on April 22, 1984, in the intensive-care unit at the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey, California, at age 82. He was surrounded by his wife, two children and five grandchildren. His body was cremated and his ashes were scattered on Half Dome at Yosemite National Park.\nPublishing rights for most of Adams's photographs are handled by the trustees of The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust. An archive of Adams's work is located at the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Numerous works by the artist have been sold at auction, including a mural-sized print of Clearing Winter Storm, Yosemite National Park, which sold at Sotheby's New York in June 2010 for $722,500, then the highest price ever paid for an original Ansel Adams photograph. This price was surpassed by another mural-sized print of one of his photographs, The Tetons and the Snake River, sold for $988,000 at Sotheby's New York, on December 14, 2020.\nJohn Szarkowski states in the introduction to Ansel Adams: Classic Images (1985, p. 5), \"The love that Americans poured out for the work and person of Ansel Adams during his old age, and that they have continued to express with undiminished enthusiasm since his death, is an extraordinary phenomenon, perhaps even unparalleled in our country's response to a visual artist.\"\nAdams's wife, Virginia Rose Best, died on January 29, 2000, aged 96.\n\n\n== Contributions and influence ==\n\n\n=== Landscapes of the American West ===\n\nRomantic landscape artists Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Moran portrayed the Grand Canyon and Yosemite during the 19th century, followed by photographers Carleton Watkins, Eadweard Muybridge, and George Fiske. Adams's work is distinguished from theirs by his interest in the transient and ephemeral. He photographed at varying times of the day and of the year, capturing the landscape's changing light and atmosphere.\nArt critic John Szarkowski wrote, \"Ansel Adams attuned himself more precisely than any photographer before him to a visual understanding of the specific quality of the light that fell on a specific place at a specific moment. For Adams the natural landscape is not a fixed and solid sculpture but an insubstantial image, as transient as the light that continually redefines it. This sensibility to the specificity of light was the motive that forced Adams to develop his legendary photographic technique.\"\nThe creation of Adams's grand, highly detailed images was driven by his interest in the natural environment. With increasing environmental degradation in the West during the 20th century, his photos show a commitment to conservation. His black-and-white photographs were not just documentation, but reflected a sublime experience of nature as a spiritual place.\nIn 1955, Edward Steichen selected Adams's Mount Williamson for the world-touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man, which was seen by nine million visitors. At 10 by 12 feet (3.0 by 3.7 m), his was the largest print in the exhibition, presented floor-to-ceiling in a prominent position as the backdrop to the section \"Relationships\", as a reminder of the essential reliance of humanity on the soil. However, despite its striking and prominent display, Adams expressed displeasure at the \"gross\" enlargement and \"poor\" quality of the print.\n\n\n=== Group f/64 ===\n\nIn 1932, Adams helped form the anti-pictorialist Group f/64, a loose and relatively short-lived association of like-minded \"straight\" or \"pure\" photographers on the West Coast whose members included Edward Weston and Imogen Cunningham. The modernist group favored sharp focus—f/64 being a very small aperture setting that gives great depth of field on large-format view cameras—contact printing, precisely exposed images of natural forms and found objects, and the use of the entire tonal range of a photograph.\nAdams wrote the group's manifesto for their exhibition at the De Young Museum:\n\nGroup f/64 limits its members and invitational names to those workers who are striving to define photography as an art-form by a simple and direct presentation through purely photographic methods. The Group will show no work at any time that does not conform to its standards of pure photography. Pure photography is defined as possessing no qualities of [technique], composition or ideas, derivative of any other art-form. The production of the \"Pictorialist,\" on the other hand, indicates a devotion to principles of art, which are directly related to painting and the graphic arts. The members of Group f/64 believe that Photography, as an art-form, must develop along lines defined by the actualities and limitations of the photographic medium, and must always remain independent of ideological conventions of art and aesthetics that are reminiscent of a period of culture antedating the growth of the medium itself.\nThe f/64 school met with opposition from the pictorialists, particularly William Mortensen, who called their work \"hard and brittle\". Adams disliked the work of Mortensen and disliked him personally, referring to him as the \"Anti-Christ\". The purists were friends with prominent historians, and their influence led to the exclusion of Mortensen from histories of photography.\nAdams later developed this purist approach into the Zone System.\n\n\n=== The Zone System ===\n\nWhile Adams and portrait photographer Fred Archer were teaching at the Art Center School in Los Angeles, around 1939–1940, they developed the Zone System for managing the photographic process, which was based on sensitometry, the study of the light-sensitivity of photographic materials and the relationship between exposure time and the resulting density on a negative. The Zone System provides a calibrated scale of brightness, from Zone 0 (black) through shades of gray to Zone X (white). The photographer can take light readings of key elements in a scene and use the Zone System to determine how the film must be exposed, developed, and printed to achieve the desired brightness or darkness in the final image. Although it originated for black-and-white sheet film, the Zone System can be applied to images captured on roll film, both black-and-white and color, negative and reversal, and to digital photography.\n\n\n=== Photography department at the Museum of Modern Art ===\nIn 1940, with trustee David H. McAlpin and curator Beaumont Newhall, Adams helped establish the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. MoMA was the first major American art museum to establish a photography department. Adams acted as McAlpin and Newhall's primary advisor; Peter Galassi, the chief curator of the department in later years, said \"Adams's dedication and boundless energy were vital to the creation of the department and to its programs in its early years.\" For those who had sought institutional recognition for photography as art, the founding of the department was an important moment, marking the medium's recognition as a subject equal to painting and sculpture.\nOn December 31, 1940, the department opened its first exhibition, Sixty Photographs: A Survey of Camera Esthetics, which resembled large survey exhibitions that Adams and Newhall had previously mounted independently. The exhibition took aesthetic quality as a guiding principle, a philosophy that ran counter to that of many writers and critics, who argued that the medium's more vernacular use as a means of communication should be more fully represented. Photographer Ralph Steiner, writing for PM, remarked \"on the whole it [MoMA] seems to regard photography as soft music at high tea rather than as a jazz at a beefsteak supper.\" Tom Maloney, publisher of U.S. Camera, wrote that the exhibition was \"very choice, very pristine, very small, very ultra.\" According to Newhall, the exhibition was meant to showcase artistic excellence and \"not to define but to suggest the possibilities of photographic vision.\"\n\n\n=== Environmental protection ===\nIn his autobiography, Adams expressed his concern about Americans' loss of connection to nature in the course of industrialization and the exploitation of the land's natural resources. He stated, \"We all know the tragedy of the dustbowls, the cruel unforgivable erosions of the soil, the depletion of fish or game, and the shrinking of the noble forests. And we know that such catastrophes shrivel the spirit of the people... The wilderness is pushed back, man is everywhere. Solitude, so vital to the individual man, is almost nowhere.\"\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\nAdams received a number of awards during his lifetime and posthumously, and several awards and places have been named in his honor.\nFor his photography, Adams received an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society in 1976 and the Hasselblad Award in 1981. Two of his photographs, The Tetons and the Snake River and a view of the Golden Gate Bridge from Baker Beach, were among the 115 images recorded on the Voyager Golden Record aboard the Voyager spacecraft. These images were selected to convey information about humans, plants and animals, and geological features of the Earth to a possibly alien civilization.\nFor his conservation efforts, Adams received the Sierra Club John Muir Award in 1963. In 1968, he was awarded the Conservation Service Award, the highest award of the Department of the Interior. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, for \"his efforts to preserve this country's wild and scenic areas, both on film and on earth. Drawn to the beauty of nature's monuments, he is regarded by environmentalists as a national institution.\"\nAdams received an honorary artium doctor degree from Harvard University and an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Yale University. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. In 2007, he was inducted into the California Hall of Fame by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver.\nThe Sierra Club's Ansel Adams Award for Conservation Photography was established in 1971, and the Ansel Adams Award for Conservation was established in 1980 by The Wilderness Society, which also has a large permanent gallery of his work on display at its Washington, D.C. headquarters. The Minarets Wilderness in the Inyo National Forest and a 11,760-foot (3,580 m) peak therein were renamed the Ansel Adams Wilderness and Mount Ansel Adams, respectively, in 1985.\nIn 1984 Adams was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Photographs ==\n\n\n=== Color images ===\nAdams was known mostly for his boldly printed, large-format black-and-white images, but he also worked extensively with color. However, he preferred black-and-white photography, which he believed could be manipulated to produce a wide range of bold, expressive tones, and felt constricted by the rigidity of the color process. Most of his color work was done on assignments, and he did not consider it to be important or expressive, even explicitly forbidding any posthumous exploitation of it.\n\n\n=== Notable photographs ===\n\nLodgepole Pines, Lyell Fork of the Merced River, Yosemite National Park, 1921\nMonolith, the Face of Half Dome, Yosemite National Park, 1927\nRose and Driftwood, San Francisco, California, 1932\nGeorgia O'Keeffe and Orville Cox, Canyon de Chelly National Monument, 1937\nClearing Winter Storm, Yosemite National Park, c. 1937\nHalf Dome, Merced River, Winter, 1938\nMoonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, 1941\nEvening, McDonald Lake, Glacier National Park, 1942\nThe Tetons and the Snake River, Grand Teton National Park, 1942\nWinter Sunrise, Sierra Nevada, from Lone Pine, California, 1944\nMount Williamson, Sierra Nevada, from Manzanar, California, 1944\nAspens, Northern New Mexico, New Mexico, 1958\nMoon and Half Dome, Yosemite National Park, California, 1960\nEl Capitan, Winter Sunrise, 1968\n\n\n=== Published works ===\nAdams, Ansel (1935).

        "content": "Neatsville is an unincorporated community in Adair County, in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It is located at the junction of Kentucky Route 206 and Kentucky Route 76. Its elevation is 705 feet (215 m). For unknown reasons, the town's name was spelled as Neetsville from 1876 until 1886, when the town's post office closed. In its early history from around the 1810s to 1900, Neatsville progressively grew to become a well-established, incorporated town. It has been relocated twice through the years, once due to flooding c. 1900 – c. 1902, which decimated the town, and once in the 1960s when the Green River was impounded to make way for the Green River Reservoir.\n\n\n== History ==\nVarious sources and accounts have referred to Neatsville as a village, as a postal village, as a hamlet and as a town at different times in its history.\nThe community was settled in the early 1800s by the Neats, with Randolph Neat being the first to acquire land there. As it expanded, the community grew to encompass several stores, a hotel, a doctor's office, mills, a sawmill, distilleries, a saloon, a salt works, a cooper shop, a carding machine, and a Masonic Lodge. It was incorporated as a town on February 23, 1847. Its post office was established on March 13, 1844, and closed in 1886. In 1848 the town's population was estimated to be around 50, and in 1876 the town's population was estimated at 60. The Masonic Lodge was relocated to Pellyton in 1917.\n\n\n=== Relocations ===\nSometime circa 1900–1902, a significant flood decimated the town, necessitating its relocation from the north bank to the south bank of the Green River, at which time the former location was abandoned. Erosion had occurred in the foundations of the buildings in the former location due to the flooding. A 1916 local account of the town's former site after the flooding characterized it as \"nearly obliterated\" and \"in ruins\". Neatsville was later relocated to its present location sometime in the 1960s, when the Green River was impounded to enable the creation of the Green River Reservoir.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Madeira",
        "content": "Madeira ( mə-DEER-ə or  mə-DAIR-ə; European Portuguese: [mɐˈðɐjɾɐ]), officially the Autonomous Region of Madeira (Portuguese: Região Autónoma da Madeira), is an autonomous region of Portugal. It is an archipelago situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, in the region of Macaronesia, just under 400 kilometres (250 mi) north of the Canary Islands, Spain, 520 kilometres (320 mi) west of the Morocco and 805 kilometres (500 mi) southwest of mainland Portugal. Madeira sits on the African Tectonic Plate, but is culturally, politically and ethnically associated with Europe, with its population predominantly descended from Portuguese settlers. Its population was 251,060 in 2021. The capital of Madeira is Funchal, on the main island's south coast.\nThe archipelago includes the islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Desertas, administered together with the separate archipelago of the Savage Islands. Roughly half of the population lives in Funchal. The region has political and administrative autonomy through the Administrative Political Statute of the Autonomous Region of Madeira provided for in the Portuguese Constitution. The region is an integral part of the European Union as an outermost region. Madeira generally has a mild/moderate subtropical climate with mediterranean summer droughts and winter rain. Many microclimates are found at different elevations.\nMadeira, uninhabited at the time, was claimed by Portuguese sailors in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1419 and settled after 1420. The archipelago is the first territorial discovery of the exploratory period of the Age of Discovery.\nMadeira is a year-round resort, particularly for Portuguese, but also British (148,000 visits in 2021), and Germans (113,000). It is by far the most populous and densely populated Portuguese island. The region is noted for its Madeira wine, flora, and fauna, with its pre-historic laurel forest, classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The destination is certified by EarthCheck. The main harbour in Funchal has long been the leading Portuguese port in cruise ship dockings, an important stopover for Atlantic passenger cruises between Europe, the Caribbean and North Africa. In addition, the International Business Centre of Madeira, also known as the Madeira Free Trade Zone, was established in the 1980s. It includes (mainly tax-related) incentives.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nPlutarch in his Parallel Lives (Sertorius, 75 AD) referring to the military commander Quintus Sertorius (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to Cádiz, he met sailors who spoke of idyllic Atlantic islands: \"The islands are said to be two in number separated by a very narrow strait and lie 10,000 furlongs [2,000 km] from Africa. They are called the Isles of the Blessed.\"\nArchaeological evidence suggests that the islands may have been visited by the Vikings sometime between 900 and 1030.\nAccounts by Muhammad al-Idrisi state that the Mugharrarin (\"the adventurers\" – seafarers from Lisbon) came across an island where they found \"a huge quantity of sheep, the meat of which was bitter and inedible\" before going to the more inhabited Canary Islands, in Spain. This island, possibly Madeira or Hierro, must have been inhabited or previously visited by people for livestock to be present.\n\n\n=== Legend ===\nDuring the reign of King Edward III of England, lovers Robert Machim and Anna d'Arfet were said to have fled from England to France in 1346. Driven off course by a violent storm, their ship ran aground along the coast of an island that may have been Madeira. Later, this legend was the basis of the naming of the city of Machico on the island, in memory of the young lovers.\n\n\n=== European exploration ===\nMadeira appears in several medieval manuscripts, including the Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms from the early 14th century, the Medici-Laurentian Atlas from 1351, the Soleri Portolani from 1380 and 1385 and Corbitis Atlas from the late 14th century. These texts refer to Madeira as Lecmane, Lolegname, Legnami (the isle of wood), Puerto or Porto Santo, deserte or deserta, and desierta. It is widely accepted that knowledge of these Atlantic islands existed before their better-documented discovery and successful settlement by the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nIn 1418, two captains, João Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira, while exploring the African coast in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator, were driven off course by a storm to an island which they named Porto Santo (English: \"holy harbour\") in gratitude for divine deliverance from a shipwreck.\nThe following year, Zarco and Vaz organised an expedition with Bartolomeu Perestrello. The trio travelled to the island of Porto Santo, claimed it on behalf of the Portuguese Crown, and established a settlement. The new settlers observed \"a heavy black cloud suspended to the southwest\" and upon investigation discovered the larger island they called Madeira (Portuguese: madeira, lit. 'wood').\n\n\n=== Settlement ===\nThe first Portuguese settlers began colonizing the islands around 1420 or 1425.\nThe three governors, knights of the Order of Christ and navigators: João Gonçalves Zarco, Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo, along with their respective families, became the first settlers of the archipelago divided by three captaincies (respectively and Funchal, Machico and Porto Santo). This colonization process began in 1425, by order of King João I, with people of modest means, some former prisoners of the Kingdom and a group of people from the lower nobility, including fishermen and peasant farmers who willingly left Portugal for a new life on the islands, a better one, they hoped, than was possible in a Portugal which had been ravaged by the Black Death, and where the best farmlands were strictly controlled by the nobility.\nInitially, the settlers produced wheat for their own sustenance but later began to export wheat to mainland Portugal. In earlier times, fish and vegetables were the settlers' main means of subsistence.\nGrain production began to fall and the ensuing crisis forced Henry the Navigator to order other commercial crops to be planted so that the islands could be profitable. These specialised plants, and their associated industrial technology, created one of the major revolutions on the islands and fuelled Portuguese industry. Following the introduction of the first water-driven sugar mill on Madeira, sugar production increased to over 6,000 arrobas (an arroba was equal to 11 to 12 kilograms or 24 to 26 pounds) by 1455, using advisers from Sicily and financed by Genoese capital (Genoa acted as an integral part of the island economy until the 17th century). The accessibility of Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders, who were keen to bypass Venetian monopolies.\n\nBy 1480 Antwerp had some seventy ships engaged in the Madeira sugar trade, with the refining and distribution concentrated in Antwerp. By the 1490s Madeira had overtaken Cyprus as a producer of sugar.\nSugarcane production was the primary engine of the island's economy, which quickly afforded the Funchal metropolis economic prosperity. The production of sugar cane attracted adventurers and merchants from all parts of Europe, especially Italians, Basques, Catalans, and Flemish. This meant that, in the second half of the fifteenth century, the city of Funchal became a mandatory port of call for European trade routes.\nSlaves were used during the island's period of sugar trade to cultivate sugar cane alongside paid workers, though slave owners were only a small minority of the Madeiran population, and those who did own slaves owned only a few. Slaves consisted of Guanches from the nearby Canary Islands. Barbary corsairs from North Africa, who enslaved Europeans from ships and coastal communities throughout the Mediterranean region, captured 1,200 people in Porto Santo in 1617.\nUntil the first half of the sixteenth century, Madeira was one of the major sugar markets of the Atlantic. Apparently, it is in Madeira that, in the context of sugar production, slave labour was applied for the first time. The colonial system of sugar production was put into practice on the island of Madeira, on a much smaller scale, and later transferred, on a large scale, to other overseas production areas.\nSugar mills were gradually abandoned, with few remaining, which gave way to other markets in Madeira.\nIn the 17th century, as Portuguese sugar production was shifted to Brazil, São Tomé and Príncipe and elsewhere, Madeira's most important commodity product became its wine. Sugar plantations were replaced by vineyards, originating in the so-called 'Wine Culture', which acquired international fame and provided the rise of a new social class, the Bourgeoisie.\n\nWith the increase of commercial treaties with England, important English merchants settled on the Island and, ultimately, controlled the increasingly important island wine trade. The English traders settled in the Funchal as of the seventeenth century, consolidating the markets from North America, the West Indies and England itself. The Madeira wine became very popular in the markets and it is also said to have been used in a toast during the Declaration of Independence by the Founding Fathers of the United States.\nAs a result of a high demand for the season, there was a need to prepare guides for visitors. The first tourist guide of Madeira appeared in 1850 and focused on elements of history, geology, flora, fauna and customs of the island. Regarding hotel infrastructures, the British and the Germans were the first to launch the Madeiran hotel chain. The historic Belmond Reid's Palace opened in 1891 as the \"Reid's New Hotel\" and is still open to this day.\nThe British first amicably occupied the island in 1801 whereafter Colonel William Henry Clinton became governor. A detachment of the 85th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant-colonel James Willoughby Gordon garrisoned the island.\nAfter the Peace of Amiens, British troops withdrew in 1802, only to reoccupy Madeira in 1807 until the end of the Peninsular War in 1814. In 1846 James Julius Wood wrote a series of seven sketches of the island. In 1856, British troops recovering from cholera, and widows and orphans of soldiers fallen in the Crimean War, were stationed in Funchal, Madeira.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring the Great War on 3 December 1916, a German U-boat, SM U-38, captained by Max Valentiner, entered Funchal harbour on Madeira. U-38 torpedoed and sank three ships, bringing the war to Portugal by extension. The ships sunk were:\n\nCS Dacia (1,684 tonnes or 1,856 short tons), a British cable-laying vessel. Dacia had previously undertaken war work off the coast of Casablanca and Dakar. It was in the process of diverting the German South American cable into Brest, France.\nSS Kanguroo (2,262 tonnes or 2,493 short tons), a French specialized \"heavy-lift\" transport.\nSurprise (620 tonnes or 680 short tons), a French gunboat. Her commander and 34 crewmen (including 7 Portuguese) were killed.\nAfter attacking the ships, U-38 bombarded Funchal for two hours from a range of about 3 kilometres (2 mi). Batteries on Madeira returned fire and eventually forced U-38 to withdraw.\nOn 12 December 1917, two German U-boats, SM U-156 and SM U-157 (captained by Max Valentiner), again bombarded Funchal. This time the attack lasted around 30 minutes. The U-boats fired 40 120 and 150 mm (4.7 and 5.9 in) shells. There were three fatalities and 17 wounded; a number of houses and Santa Clara church were hit.\nThe last Austrian Emperor, Charles I, was exiled to Madeira after the war. Determined to prevent an attempt to restore Charles to the throne, the Council of Allied Powers agreed he could go into exile on Madeira because it was isolated in the Atlantic and easily guarded. He died there on 1 April 1922 and his coffin lies in a chapel of the Church of Our Lady of Monte.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Madeira archipelago is located 520 km (280 nmi) from the African coast, 805 km (430 nmi) from the closest point in the European coast (the Portuguese town of Sagres, in Algarve) and 1,000 km (540 nmi) from the capital of Portugal, Lisbon (approximately a one-and-a-half-hour flight). Madeira inhabits the extreme south of the Madeira-Tore Rise, a bathymetric structure oriented along a north-northeast to south-southwest axis that extends for 1,000 kilometres (540 nmi). This structure consists of long geomorphological relief that extends from the abyssal plain to 3,500 m (11,500 ft); its highest submersed point reaches a depth of about 150 m (490 ft) (around latitude 36°N). The origins of the Madeira-Tore Rise are not clearly established, but may have resulted from a buckling of the lithosphere.\n\n\n=== Islands and islets ===\nMadeira (740.7 km2 or 286 sq mi), including Ilhéu de Agostinho, Ilhéu de São Lourenço, Ilhéu Mole (northwest); Total population: 262,456 (2011 Census).\nPorto Santo (42.5 km2 or 16.4 sq mi), including Ilhéu de Baixo ou da Cal, Ilhéu de Ferro, Ilhéu das Cenouras, Ilhéu de Fora, Ilhéu de Cima; Total population: 5,483 (2011 Census).\nDesertas Islands (14.2 km2 or 5.5 sq mi), including the three uninhabited islands: Deserta Grande Island, Bugio Island and Ilhéu de Chão.\nSavage Islands (3.6 km2 or 1.4 sq mi), archipelago 280 km south-southeast of Madeira Island including three main uninhabited islands and 16 islets in two groups: the Northeast Group (Selvagem Grande Island, Ilhéu de Palheiro da Terra, Ilhéu de Palheiro do Mar) and the Southwest Group (Selvagem Pequena Island, Ilhéu Grande, Ilhéu Sul, Ilhéu Pequeno, Ilhéu Fora, Ilhéu Alto, Ilhéu Comprido, Ilhéu Redondo, Ilhéu Norte).\n\n\n=== Peaks ===\n\nThe ten tallest peaks in Madeira exemplify the island's diverse topography. Pico Ruivo is the highest at 1,862 metres (6,109 ft). Madeira's mountaintops offer vistas of rugged terrain and the Atlantic Ocean and attract hikers and nature enthusiasts.\n\n\n==== Madeira Island ====\n\nMadeira island is at the top of a massive shield volcano that rises about 6 km (20,000 ft) from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, on the Tore underwater mountain range. The volcano formed atop an east–west rift in the oceanic crust along the African Plate, beginning during the Miocene epoch (5 million years ago), continuing into the Pleistocene (700,000 years ago). This was followed by extensive erosion, producing two large amphitheatres opening southward in the central part of the island. Volcanic activity later resumed, producing scoria cones and lava flows atop the eroded shield. The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central part of the island 6,500 years ago, creating more cinder cones and lava flows.\nIt is the largest island of the group with an area of 741 km2 (286 sq mi), a length of 57 km (35 mi) (from Ponte de São Lourenço to Ponta do Pargo). It is approximately 22 km (14 mi) at its widest point (from Ponta da Cruz to Ponta de São Jorge), with a coastline of 150 km (90 mi). It has a mountain ridge that extends along the centre of the island, reaching 1,862 metres (6,109 feet) at its highest point (Pico Ruivo), staying below 200 metres along its eastern extent. The primitive volcanic foci responsible for the central mountainous area, consisted of the peaks: Ruivo (1,862 m), Torres (1,851 m), Arieiro (1,818 m), Cidrão (1,802 m), Cedro (1,759 m), Casado (1,725 m), Grande (1,657 m), Ferreiro (1,582 m). At the end of this eruptive phase, reefs encircled the island, its marine vestiges evident in a calcareous layer in the area of Lameiros, in São Vicente. Sea cliffs, such as Cabo Girão, valleys and ravines extend from this central spine, leaving the interior generally inaccessible. Daily life is concentrated in the many villages at the mouths of the ravines, through which the heavy autumn and winter rains travel to the sea.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMadeira has many different bioclimates. Based on differences in sun exposure, humidity, and annual mean temperature, clear variations distinguish north- and south-facing regions, as well as some islands. The islands are strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream and Canary Current, giving it mild to warm year-round temperatures. According to the Instituto de Meteorologia (IPMA), the average annual temperature at Funchal weather station is 19.6 °C (67.3 °F) for the 1981–2010 period. Relief is a determinant factor on precipitation levels; areas such as the Madeira Natural Park can get as much as 2,800 mm (110 in) of precipitation a year. Madeira hosts lush laurel forests, while Porto Santo, a much flatter island, has a semiarid climate (BSh). In most winters snowfall occurs in the mountains.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\n\n==== Endemic plant and animal species ====\nIn the south, little is left of the indigenous subtropical rainforest that once covered the island (the original settlers set fires to clear the land for farming) and named it (madeira means \"wood\" in Portuguese). However, in the north, the valleys harbor native trees. These laurisilva forests, notably those on the northern slopes, are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Madeira's paleobotanical record reveals that laurissilva forest has existed for at least 1.8 million years. Critically endangered species such as the vine Jasminum azoricum and the rowan Sorbus maderensis are endemic. The Madeiran large white butterfly was an endemic subspecies of the large white that inhabited the laurissilva forests but has not been seen since 1977.\n\n\n==== Madeiran wall lizard ====\n\n\n==== Madeiran wolf spider ====\nHogna ingens, the Deserta Grande wolf spider, is endemic to the Madeira archipelago, specifically Deserta Grande Island. It is critically endangered. It is considered the largest member of its family. Restoration efforts are underway.\n\n\n==== Birds ====\n\nThree species of birds are endemic to Madeira: the Trocaz pigeon, the Madeira chaffinch and the Madeira firecrest. In addition extinct species include the Madeiran scops owl, two rail species, Rallus adolfocaesaris and R. lowei, and two quail species, Coturnix lignorum and C. alabrevis, and the Madeiran wood pigeon, a subspecies of the common wood pigeon and which was last seen in the early 20th century.\nA great auk bone is known from the Selvagens, suggesting this seabird visited at least sporadically.\n\n\n==== Mice ====\nMadeira is home to six distinct chromosomal varieties of house mice, believed to be descendants of common European house mice brought to the island by Vikings in the 9th century (or conceivably by 15th century Portuguese settlers), but diversified to the point where at least some likely cannot interbreed with their continental relatives or with one another. They have essentially the same genes, but rearranged to give different chromosome numbers: the ancestral species has 40 chromosomes, whereas the Madeira populations have from 22 to 30. The deep valleys of Madeira are separated by high ground, and the different lineages of mice do not encounter each other.\n\n\n=== Levadas ===\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Political autonomy ===\nDue to its distinct geography, economy, social and cultural situation, as well as the historical autonomic aspirations of the population, the Autonomous Regions of Madeira was established in 1976. Although it is a politico-administrative autonomous region, the Portuguese constitution specifies both a regional and national connection, obliging their administrations to maintain democratic principles and promote regional interests, while reinforcing national unity.\nAs defined by the Portuguese constitution and other laws, Madeira possesses its own political and administrative statute and has its own government. The branches of Government are the Regional Government and the Legislative Assembly, the latter elected by universal suffrage, using the D'Hondt method of proportional representation.\nThe president of the Regional Government is appointed by the Representative of the Republic according to the results of the election to the legislative assemblies.\nThe sovereignty of the Portuguese Republic is represented in Madeira by the Representative of the Republic, appointed by the President of the Republic on the advice of the Government of the Republic. The tasks of the Representative of the Republic are to sign and order the publication of regional legislative decrees and regional regulatory decrees or to exercise the right of veto over regional laws, should these laws be unconstitutional. Before the sixth amendment to the Portuguese Constitution passed in 2006, this responsibility was held by a more-powerful Minister of the Republic, who was proposed by the Government and appointed by the President.\n\n\n=== Status within the European Union ===\nMadeira is an Outermost Region (OMR) of the European Union, meaning that due to its geographical situation, it is entitled to derogation from some EU policies.\nAccording to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, both primary and secondary European Union law applies to Madeira, with possible derogations to take account of its \"structural social and economic situation (...) which is compounded by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development\". An example of such derogation is seen in the approval of the International Business Centre of Madeira and other state aid policies to help the rum industry.\nIt forms part of the European Union customs area, the Schengen Area and the European Union Value Added Tax Area.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations and defence ===\nForeign affairs and defence are the responsibility of the national government. The Madeira Military Zone is the Portuguese Army's command for ground forces stationed in the islands, centering on the 3rd Garrison Regiment based at Funchal. The Navy tasks the patrol vessels Tejo and Mondego specifically to Madeira, as well as other vessels as required, in order to patrol Portugal's large economic zone. To support search and rescue, the Portuguese Air Force maintains a staging base on Porto Santo Island incorporating detachments of C-295 aircraft and Merlin helicopters.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nAdministratively, Madeira is divided into fifty four parishes and eleven municipalities:\n\n\n=== Funchal ===\n\n\n=== Sister Jurisdictions ===\nMadeira Island has the following sister jurisdictions:\n\n Aosta Valley, Italy (1987)\n Jersey (1998)\n Eastern Cape, South Africa\n Jeju Province, South Korea (2007)\n Gibraltar (2009)\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Diaspora ===\n\nMadeirans migrated to the United States, Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago. Madeiran immigrants in North America mostly clustered in New England and mid-Atlantic states, Toronto, Northern California, and Hawaii. The city of New Bedford is especially rich in Madeirans, hosting the Museum of Madeira Heritage. The annual Madeiran and Luso-American celebration, the Feast of the Blessed Sacrament, the world's largest celebration of Madeiran heritage, regularly draws crowds of tens of thousands to the city's Madeira Field.\n\nIn the 1846 famine, over 6,000 inhabitants migrated to British Guiana. In 1891 they numbered 4.3% of the population. In 1902 5,000 Portuguese people, mostly Madeirans, lived in Honolulu, Hawaii. By 1910 this grew to 21,000.\n1849 saw an emigration of Protestant religious exiles from Madeira to the United States, by way of Trinidad and elsewhere in the West Indies. Most of them settled in Illinois with financial and physical aid of the American Protestant Society, headquartered in New York City. In the late 1830s physician and Presbyterian minister Reverend Robert Reid Kalley, from Scotland made a stop at Funchal, Madeira on his way to a mission in China, with his wife, so that she could recover from an illness. Kalley and his wife stayed on Madeira where he began preaching the Protestant gospel and converting islanders from Catholicism. Eventually, he was arrested and imprisoned for his religious conversion activities. Another Scottish missionary, William Hepburn Hewitson, took on Protestant ministerial activities in Madeira. By 1846, about 1,000 Protestant Madeirenses, who were discriminated against and the subjects of mob violence because of their religious conversions, chose to immigrate to Trinidad and elsewhere in the West Indies in answer a call for sugar plantation workers. The exiles did not fare well there. The tropical climate was unfamiliar and they found themselves in serious economic difficulties. By 1848, the American Protestant Society raised money and sent Rev. Manuel J. Gonsalves, a Baptist minister and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Madeira, to work with Rev. Arsénio da Silva, who had emigrated with the exiles from Madeira, to arrange to resettle those who wanted to come to the United States. Rev. da Silva died in early 1849. Later in 1849, Rev. Gonsalves was then charged with escorting the exiles from Trinidad to settle in Sangamon and Morgan counties in Illinois on land purchased with funds raised by the American Protestant Society. Accounts state that anywhere from 700 to 1,000 exiles came to the United States at this time.\nSeveral large Madeiran communities continue around the world, including in the UK and Jersey. The Portuguese British community, made up mostly of Madeirans, celebrate Madeira Day.\nIn Venezuela the Madeiran Portuguese settled in cities such as Caracas and rural areas of the interior. According to figures from the 1990s, around 70% of the Portuguese diaspora in that country was made up of Madeirans and their descendants, initially dedicated to activities such as agriculture, but later, due to the lack of government support, the emigrants concentrated on commerce in the large Venezuelan cities. Among the companies founded by Madeirans are the supermarkets Central Madeirense, Excelsior Gama, Supermercados Unicasa and Automercados Plaza, and many renowned bakeries. A state in Venezuela called Portuguesa was named after its large Portuguese population.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nMadeira is part of the Schengen Area.\nDue to its growing popularity, Madeira's population has grown, reaching 253,259 in 2022, of whom the majority are locals. But Madeira has, for many years, witnessed a rising foreign population. As of 31 December 2022, immigrants in the region totaled 11,793 people, representing an increase of 13.3% compared to 2021. \"Nationals from Venezuela (19.7%), the United Kingdom (11.8%), Germany (9.4%) and Brazil (9.2%) continue to represent the main foreign communities in the region\", according to the DREM (Madeira Statistics Department).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) reached nearly 7 billion euros in 2023, accounting for 2.6% of Portugal's economic output. GDP per capita was of 27,370 euros or 73% of the EU27 average. The GDP per employee was 71% of the EU average.\nMadeira embraced Bitcoin by implementing policies that exempt Bitcoin investors from paying personal income taxes in the region. Madeira Regional Government President Miguel Albuquerque confirmed the inauguration of a business hub focused solely on Bitcoin and related innovations. Speaking in a dialogue with Prince Filip Karađorđević of Serbia at Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023, he framed the move as a significant step toward technological advancements and international partnerships.\n\n\n=== Madeira International Business Center ===\n\nThe Madeira International Business Center (MIBC) free trade zone has led to additional infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. MIBC comprises three sectors of investment: the Industrial Free Trade Zone, the International Shipping Register – MAR and International Services. Madeira's tax regime has been approved by the European Commission as legal State Aid and its deadline was extended through 2027. MIBC was created formally in the 1980s as a tool of regional economic policy. It consists of (mainly tax) incentives, granted with the objective of attracting investment into Madeira.\nFavorable operational and fiscal conditions were approved by the European Commission under Article 299 of the Treaty on European Union. The MIBC is integrated in the Portuguese and EU legal systems and is regulated and supervised by Portuguese and EU authorities in a transparent and stable business environment, clearly distinguished from so-called \"tax havens\" and \"offshore jurisdictions\". In 2015, the EC authorized a state aid regime for companies incorporated between 2015 and 2020 and extended the regime of tax reductions through 2027. The tax regime is outlined in Article 36°-A of the Portuguese Tax Incentives Statute. Available data demonstrates that this programme aided the local labor market, through the creation of qualified jobs and for professionals who have returned to Madeira; increased productivity; expanded business tourism from the visits of investors and their clients and suppliers, and other sectors such as real estate. Telecommunications and other services benefit from a larger client base. Companies attracted by MIBC represent over 40% of revenue in terms of corporate income tax for the Government of Madeira and nearly 3.000 jobs. Salaries there are above average in comparison with the wages paid in other sectors.\n\n\n=== Regional government ===\n\nMadeira has been a significant recipient of European Union funding, totaling €2 billion. In 2012, it was reported that despite a population of just 250,000, the local administration owed some €6 billion. The Portuguese treasury (IGCP) assumed Madeira's debt management between 2012 and 2015. The region works with the central government on a long-term plan to reduce debt levels and commercial debt stock. Moody's noted that the region made significant fiscal consolidation efforts and that its tax revenue collection has improved. Tax revenues increased by 41% between 2012 and 2016, helping the region to reduce its deficit to operating revenue ratio to 10% in 2016 from 77% in 2013.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is an important sector in the region's economy, contributing 20% to the region's GDP, providing support throughout the year for commercial, transport and other activities and constituting a significant market for local products. The share in Gross Value Added of hotels and restaurants (9%) also highlights this phenomenon. The island of Porto Santo, with its 9-kilometre-long (5.6 mi) beach and its climate, is entirely devoted to tourism.\nVisitors are mainly from Europe, with Portuguese, British, German and French tourists providing the main contingents (2021). The average annual occupancy rate was 60.3% in 2008, reaching its maximum in March and April, when it exceeds 70%.\nThe best time to visit Madeira is during spring and autumn for mild weather and fewer crowds, making it ideal for outdoor activities. Summer is perfect for beach lovers but can be crowded, while winter offers mild temperatures and fewer tourists, making it ideal for experiencing the island's waterfalls.\n\n\n==== Whale watching ====\nWhale watching has become very popular in recent years. Many species of dolphins, such as common dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin, striped dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, short-finned pilot whale, and whales such as Bryde's whale, sei whale, fin whale, sperm whale, and beaked whales can be spotted near the coast or offshore.\n\n\n=== Sustainable development ===\nElectricity on Madeira is provided solely through EEM (Empresa de Electricidade da Madeira, SA, which holds a monopoly for the provision of electrical supply on the autonomous region) and consists largely of fossil fuels, but with a significant supply of seasonal hydroelectricity from the levada system, wind power and a small amount of solar. Energy production comes from conventional thermal and hydropower, as well as wind and solar energy. The Ribeira dos Soccoridos hydropower plant, rated at 15MW, utilises a pumped hydropower reservoir to recycle mountain water during the dry summer.\nBattery technologies are being tested to minimise Madeira's reliance on fossil fuel imports. Renault SA and EEM piloted the Sustainable Porto Santo—Smart Fossil Free Island project on Porto Santo to demonstrate how fossil fuels can be entirely replaced with renewable energy, using a 3.3 MWh battery. Madeira operates a 15 MW 1-hour lithium iron phosphate battery with black start capability.\nIn the first half of 2022, 33% of the electricity consumed on the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira was sourced from renewable energy, a milestone achieved through a collaborative initiative co-funded by the European Union (EU).\nCentral to this accomplishment are the centuries-old stone pipes known as levadas, spanning thousands of kilometers and dating back to the fifteenth century. These levadas efficiently transport rainwater from northern regions to the south, serving various purposes such as human consumption, agriculture, and electricity production.\nThe Socorridos hydroelectric power station, fueled by water conveyed through the levadas, stands as the island's principal hydraulic system, providing power consistently throughout the year. A significant aspect of the EU-funded multi-million euro project involved enhancing water storage capacity, including the construction of a 5.4-kilometer tunnel and additional mountain tunnels, presenting formidable engineering challenges.\nWind power complements the system, facilitating the movement of stored water uphill during peak demand periods. The treated water serves dual purposes—human consumption and agriculture—while also functioning as a renewable energy source. Nuno Jorge Pereira, Water Production Director for Wood, Water, and Waste (ARM), elucidates the strategic use of water volumes to adapt to energy production levels.\nThis €34.7 million project, with €17.3 million co-financed by the European Cohesion Policy, not only mitigates concerns about drought but also earned acclaim as one of the best EU co-funded projects in the EGIOSTAR Awards.\nThe optimized Socorridos plant has notably alleviated water-related challenges for local farmers.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe islands have two airports, Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport and Porto Santo Airport, on the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo respectively. From Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport the most frequent flights are to Lisbon. There are also direct flights to over 30 other airports in Europe and nearby islands.\nTransport between the two main islands is by plane, or ferries from the Porto Santo Line, the latter also carrying vehicles. Visiting the interior of the islands is now easy thanks to construction of the Vias Rápidas, major roads that cross the island. Modern roads reach all points of interest on the islands.\nFunchal has an extensive public transportation system. Bus companies, including Horários do Funchal, which has been operating for over a hundred years, have regularly scheduled routes to all points of interest on the island.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nFolklore music in Madeira is widespread and mainly uses local musical instruments such as the machete, rajão, brinquinho and cavaquinho, which are used in traditional folkloric dances like the bailinho da Madeira.\nEmigrants from Madeira also influenced the creation of new musical instruments. In the 1880s, the ukulele was created, based on two small guitar-like instruments of Madeiran origin, the cavaquinho and the rajão. The ukulele was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde. Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers. Two weeks after they disembarked from the SS Ravenscrag in late August 1879, the Hawaiian Gazette reported that \"Madeira Islanders recently arrived here, have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts.\" The Madeiran band NAPA represented Portugal in the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest with the song Deslocado.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBecause of the geographic situation of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean, the island has an abundance of fish of various kinds. The species that are consumed the most are espada (black scabbardfish), blue fin tuna, swordfish, white marlin, blue marlin, albacore, bigeye tuna, wahoo, spearfish, skipjack tuna and many others are found in the local dishes as they are found along the coast of Madeira. Espada is usually fried in a batter and accompanied by fried banana (Espada com banana) and sometimes a passionfruit sauce. Bacalhau is also popular, as it is in Mainland Portugal.\n\nThere are many different meat dishes on Madeira, one of the most popular being espetada. Espetada is traditionally made of large chunks of beef rubbed in garlic, salt and bay leaf and marinated for 4 to 6 hours in Madeira wine, red wine vinegar and olive oil then skewered onto a bay laurel stick and left to grill over smouldering wood chips. These are so integral a part of traditional eating habits that a special iron stand is available with a T-shaped end, each branch of the \"T\" having a slot in the middle to hold a brochette (espeto in Portuguese); a small plate is then placed underneath to collect the juices. The brochettes are very long and have a V-shaped blade in order to pierce the meat more easily. It is usually accompanied with the local bread called bolo do caco. A traditional holiday dish is \"Carne de Vinho e Alhos\", which is most closely associated with the pig slaughter that was held a few weeks before Christmas. A big event, traditionally it was attended by everyone in the village. The dish is made of pork which marinates for three days in white wine, vinegar, salt, and pepper and is then cooked with small potatoes, sliced carrots, and turnip. Another common meat dish is \"Picado\" – cubed beef cooked in a mushroom sauce and accompanied by fries.\nOther popular dishes in Madeira include açorda, feijoada and carne de vinha d'alhos.\nTraditional pastries in Madeira usually contain local ingredients, one of the most common being mel de cana, literally \"sugarcane honey\" (molasses). The traditional cake of Madeira is called Bolo de Mel, which translates as (Sugarcane) \"Honey Cake\" and according to custom, is never cut with a knife, but broken into pieces by hand. It is a rich and heavy cake. The cake commonly known as \"Madeira cake\" in England is named after Madeira wine.\nMalasadas are a local confection which are mainly consumed during the Carnival of Madeira. Pastéis de nata, as in the rest of Portugal, are also very popular.\nMilho frito is a popular dish in Madeira that is similar to the Italian dish polenta fritta. Açorda Madeirense is another popular local dish.\nMadeira is known for the high quality of its cherimoya fruits. The Annona Festival is traditional and held annually in the parish of Faial. This event encourages the consumption of this fruit and its derivatives, such as liqueurs, puddings, ice cream and smoothies.\n\n\n=== Beverages ===\n\nMadeira wine is a fortified wine produced in the Madeira Islands; varieties may be sweet or dry. It has a history dating back to the Age of Exploration when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. However, wine producers of Madeira discovered, when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip, that the flavour of the wine had been transformed by exposure to heat and movement. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process that involves heating the wine and deliberately exposing the wine to some levels of oxidation. Most countries limit the use of the term Madeira to those wines that come from the Madeira Islands, to which the European Union grants Protected designation of origin (PDO) status.\nA local beer called Coral is produced by the Madeira Brewery, which dates from 1872. It has achieved 2 Monde Selection Grand Gold Medals, 24 Monde Selection Gold Medals and 2 Monde Selection Silver Medals. Other alcoholic drinks are also popular in Madeira, such as the locally created Poncha, Niquita, Pé de Cabra, and Aniz, as well as Portuguese drinks such as Macieira Brandy, Licor Beirão.\nLaranjada is a type of carbonated soft drink with an orange flavour, its name being derived from the Portuguese word laranja (\"orange\"). Launched in 1872 it was the first soft drink to be produced in Portugal, and remains very popular to the present day. Brisa drinks, a brand name, are also very popular and come in a range of flavours.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Madeira and the island was indeed the first place in Portugal to host a match, organised by British residents in 1875. The island is the birthplace of international star Cristiano Ronaldo and is home to two prominent teams, C.S. Marítimo and C.D. Nacional, the latter of which he played youth football for before leaving to join Sporting CP.\nAs well as football, the island is also home to professional sports teams in basketball (CAB Madeira) and handball (Madeira Andebol SAD, who were runners up in the 2019 European Challenge Cup). Madeira was also the host of the 2003 World Handball Championship.\nThe Rally Vinho da Madeira is a rally race held annually since 1959, considered one of the biggest sporting events on the island It was part of the European Rally Championship from 1979 to 2012 and the Intercontinental Rally Challenge from 2006 to 2010.\nOther popular sporting activities include golf at one of the island's two courses (plus one on Porto Santo), surfing, scuba diving, and hiking.\n\n\n=== Postage stamps ===\n\nPortugal has issued postage stamps for Madeira during several periods, beginning in 1868.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\"Have Some Madeira M'Dear\"\nGeology of Madeira\nList of birds of Madeira\nMadeira Islands Open, an annual European Tour golf tournament\nSurfing in Madeira\nIslands of Macaronesia\nAzores\nCabo Verde\nCanary Islands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nPitta, Nicholas Cayetano de Bettencourt (1812).

        "title": "Terence Stamp",
        "content": "Terence Henry Stamp (22 July 1938 – 17 August 2025) was an English actor. Known for his sophisticated villain roles, he received various accolades including a Golden Globe Award, a Cannes Film Festival Award as well as nominations for an Academy Award and two BAFTA Awards. He was named by Empire as one of the 100 Sexiest Film Stars of All Time in 1995.\nStamp trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London, before acting in the Wolf Mankowitz production of This Year Next Year (1960) at the West End's Vaudeville Theatre. He made his American film debut playing the title role in the film Billy Budd (1962), which earned him a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award. He starred in the psychological horror film The Collector (1965) for which he won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor. He went on to appear in films such as Modesty Blaise (1966), Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), Poor Cow (1967), Teorema (1968), Spirits of the Dead (1968), and The Mind of Mr. Soames (1969).\nStamp gained wider fame for his role as archvillain General Zod in the superhero films Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980). For his leading role in the Australian road comedy The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994) he earned BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award nominations. He then starred in The Limey (1999), earning an Independent Spirit Award nomination. He also acted in films such as Wall Street (1987), Young Guns (1988), Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), The Haunted Mansion (2003), Elektra (2005), Wanted (2008), Get Smart (2008), Yes Man (2008), Valkyrie (2008), Song for Marion (2012), and Big Eyes (2014). His final performance was in Last Night in Soho (2021).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nTerence Henry Stamp, the eldest of five children, was born on 22 July 1938 in Stepney, London, England, the son of Ethel Esther (née Perrott; 1914–1985) and Thomas Stamp (1913–1982), who was a tugboat stoker. His early years were spent in Canal Road, Bow, in the East End, but later in his childhood the family moved to 124 Chadwin Road, Plaistow, West Ham, Essex (now in Greater London), where he attended Plaistow County Grammar School. His father was away for long periods with the Merchant Navy and the young Stamp was mostly raised by his mother, grandmother, and aunts. He grew up idolising actor Gary Cooper after his mother took him to see Beau Geste (1939) when he was three years old. He was also inspired by the 1950s method-trained actor James Dean.\nGrowing up in London during World War II, Stamp endured the Blitz as a child. He later aided Valkyrie director Bryan Singer in staging a scene where the von Stauffenbergs hide from the Allied bombings. After leaving school Stamp worked in a variety of advertising agencies in London, working his way up to earning a reasonable salary. In the mid‑1950s he also worked as an assistant to professional golfer Reg Knight at Wanstead Golf Club in east London. He described this period of his life positively in his autobiography Stamp Album.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1960–1977: Early career and rise to fame ===\nStamp won a scholarship to train at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, then performed in various provincial repertory theatres, most notably in a national tour of Willis Hall's play The Long the Short and the Tall alongside another young cockney actor, Michael Caine. Caine moved in with Stamp, and they began spending time with Peter O'Toole in the London party scene. In 1962, Stamp made his British film debut opposite Laurence Olivier in Term of Trial, but he is better remembered for his next role in Peter Ustinov's film adaptation of Herman Melville's Billy Budd (1962), which opened in America before Trial  His portrayal of the title character in Budd brought him not only an Academy Award nomination but also international attention. Stamp was called the \"master of the brooding silence\" by The Guardian. \n\n \nIn the mid-'60s, Stamp collaborated with some of the era's most revered filmmakers. He starred in The Collector (1965), William Wyler's adaptation of John Fowles's novel of the same name, opposite Samantha Eggar, and in Modesty Blaise (1966), for director Joseph Losey and producer Joe Janni. Stamp reunited with producer Janni for two more projects: John Schlesinger's adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Far from the Madding Crowd (1967) starring Julie Christie and Ken Loach's first feature film, Poor Cow (1967).\nStamp was approached to play the role of James Bond when Sean Connery retired from the role but did not receive a second call from producer Harry Saltzman because, in Stamp's opinion, \"my ideas about [how the role should be portrayed] put the frighteners on Harry. I didn't get a second call from him.\"\nStamp then travelled to Italy to star in Federico Fellini's Toby Dammit, a 50-minute portion of the Edgar Allan Poe film adaptation Histoires extraordinaires (1968, aka Spirits of the Dead). Stamp lived in Italy for several years, during which time his film work included Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema (1968) opposite Silvana Mangano, and A Season in Hell (1971). Stamp was considered for the title role of Alfie (1966) but turned it down in favour of Modesty Blaise (1966). Stamp's subsequent film credits included The Mind of Mr Soames (1970), in which he played an infantile patient, and The Divine Nymph (1975).\n\n\n=== 1978–1999: Superman films and other roles ===\n\nStamp portrayed the Kryptonian supervillain General Zod in Richard Donner's Superman (1978), appearing in a scene with Marlon Brando. The film and its first sequel were originally conceived as one film, with Zod and his evil conspirators returning later in the film to challenge Superman, but the screenplay was so long that the producers elected to split it into two parts. Both parts began shooting simultaneously, but production on the sequel was halted partway through due to budget and time constraints. Stamp reappeared as General Zod in Superman II (1980), as the film's primary villain. Donner was replaced as director on the sequel with Richard Lester, who completed the film using portions of Donner's original footage combined with newly filmed scenes. Total Film magazine ranked Stamp's portrayal of General Zod No. 32 on their \"Top 50 Greatest Villains of All Time\" list in 2007. On the occasion of Superman's 50th anniversary in 1988, Stamp introduced the BBC Radio special Superman On Trial, which was produced by Dirk Maggs and starred Stuart Milligan as Superman. In 2003, Stamp returned to the Superman franchise in a new role, by portraying the voice of Clark Kent's biological father Jor-El in the WB/CW television series Smallville. He also provided the scream of Zod (being exorcised from the body of Lex Luthor) in the sixth-season premiere episode \"Zod\". In 2006, he appeared as Zod once again in Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut (a retooled version of the 1980 film, which features footage shot by Donner, the film's original director).\nHe also acted in Meetings with Remarkable Men (1979) and The Hit (1984), which won a Mystfest Award for Best Actor, shared with John Hurt and Tim Roth. Also in 1984, he had the opportunity to play the Devil in a cameo in The Company of Wolves. He also appeared in Link (1986), Legal Eagles (1986), The Sicilian (1987) and a cameo as Sir Larry Wildman in Wall Street (1987). He played the ranch owner, John Tunstall, in Young Guns (1988). His film Beltenebros (1992) (aka Prince of Shadows) was premiered at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival. Stamp began his fourth decade as an actor wearing some of the choicest of Tim Chappel's Academy Award-winning costumes for the comedy The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), which costarred Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving.\nIn 1999, Stamp played a lead role in The Limey to widespread critical acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival. For his performance Stamp received nominations for Best Male Lead at the 2000 Independent Spirit Awards and for Best British Actor at the London Film Critics' Circle (ALFS) Awards. Also in 1999 Stamp appeared in the blockbuster Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace as Chancellor Finis Valorum (an experience he later described as 'boring'), followed by Bowfinger (1999) and Red Planet (2000). He also appeared in Damian Pettigrew's award-winning documentary, Fellini: I'm a Born Liar (2002), offering ideas into the mind and working methods of Italian director Federico Fellini, with whom Stamp had worked in the 1960s.\n\n\n=== 2000–2021: Later works and final roles ===\nIn later years Stamp appeared in the films Ma femme est une actrice (My Wife Is An Actress, 2001), My Boss's Daughter (2003), Disney's The Haunted Mansion (2003) and the superhero fantasy Elektra (2005). He filmed a cameo appearance for Mr & Mrs Smith, but his performance was cut from the movie. Stamp read the book Perfect Brilliant Stillness by David Carse for SilkSoundBooks. In his introductory reading, Stamp described his love for this book by saying, \"Greater love hath no man\". Stamp appeared in the music video for \"At the Bottom of Everything\" by Bright Eyes. Stamp appeared as the featured 'castaway' on BBC Radio's long-running Desert Island Discs in June 1987, and made a second appearance in March 2006 with a different selection of music. In 2002 Stamp provided the narration for History of Football: The Beautiful Game, a series on all aspects of the world's most popular sport. Stamp attended every England game (including the final) at the 1966 FIFA World Cup, and in July 2016 he narrated 1966 – A Nation Remembers shown on ITV, marking the 50th anniversary of England's World Cup victory. On 7 July 2007, Stamp gave a speech on climate change at the British leg of Live Earth in Wembley Stadium before introducing Madonna. His memoir, The Ocean Fell into the Drop, was published by Repeater Books in 2017. Stamp also narrated the BBC's The Story of Only Fools and Horses in 2017.\n\n \nIn 2008 he appeared in the film remake of the spy comedy Get Smart; another comedy about the man who says yes to everything, Yes Man, opposite Jim Carrey; with Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in Wanted; and with Tom Cruise in Valkyrie, based on the true story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. In the 2010s Stamp appeared in The Adjustment Bureau (2011), an American romantic science-fiction thriller film loosely based on the Philip K. Dick short story \"Adjustment Team\" opposite Matt Damon. In 2012 Stamp appeared in the Peter Serafinowicz-directed music video for the Hot Chip song \"Night & Day\", portrayed a grumpy husband called Arthur in Paul Andrew Williams' Song for Marion (2012), opposite Gemma Arterton and a heist comedy The Art of the Steal (2013), with Kurt Russell, Matt Dillon and Jay Baruchel.\nIn 2014 Stamp appeared in Tim Burton's dramatic film Big Eyes, with Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz. In 2016, Stamp appeared in another Tim Burton film, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, where he played Abe, the grandfather of the film's protagonist Jake.\nStamp's voice acting credits included the video game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, where he voiced the villainous cult leader Mankar Camoran; and the films Zombie Island and These Foolish Things. Stamp voiced the Prophet of Truth in Halo 3, replacing Michael Wincott. In 2005, Stamp also narrated the BBC Four documentary Jazz Britannia, which chronicles the evolution of British jazz music.\nStamp's next project was Crooked House (2017), directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner and starring Christina Hendricks, Gillian Anderson and Glenn Close. He also appears in George Mendeluk's Bitter Harvest, opposite Max Irons, Samantha Barks, Barry Pepper, and Aneurin Barnard.\nIn addition to his acting career, Stamp was an accomplished writer and author. He published three volumes of his memoirs, including Stamp Album (written in tribute to his late mother), a novel entitled The Night, and a cookbook co-written with Elizabeth Buxton to provide alternative recipes for those who are wheat- and lactose-intolerant. Stamp's final performance was in Last Night in Soho (2021).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Relationships ===\nIn the 1960s, Stamp shared a house with actor Michael Caine in Wimpole Street, London, before and during their rise to fame. In his autobiography, What's It All About (1992), Caine stated \"I still wake up sweating in the night as I see Terence agreeing to accept my advice to take the role in Alfie.\"\nAssociated with the Swinging London scene of the 1960s – during which time he was in high-profile relationships with actress Julie Christie and supermodel Jean Shrimpton – Stamp was among the subjects photographed by David Bailey for a set titled Box of Pin-Ups. He and Shrimpton were one of the most-photographed couples of Mod London. After Shrimpton ended her relationship with Stamp, he moved to India and spent time at the ashram of Krishnamurti.\nOn New Year's Eve 2002, Stamp married for the first and only time at the age of 64. His 29-year-old bride was Elizabeth O'Rourke, whom Stamp first met in the mid-1990s at a chemist's shop in Bondi, New South Wales. Of Irish-Australian and Indian-Singaporean parentage, O'Rourke was raised in Singapore before moving to Australia in her early twenties to study pharmacology. The couple divorced on the grounds of his \"unreasonable behaviour\" in April 2008.\n\n\n=== Interests ===\nStamp's brother Chris became a rock music record producer and manager credited with helping to bring the Who to prominence during the 1960s, launching the career of Jimi Hendrix and co-founding Track Records. In 1984, the band the Smiths released their third single, \"What Difference Does It Make?\" The single cover was a photograph taken on the set of the film The Collector (but not depicted in the film). Originally, Stamp refused permission for the still to be used, and some pressings featured lead singer Morrissey in a re-enacted scene. In the re-enactment Morrissey is holding a glass of milk, as opposed to the chloroform pad of the original. Eventually, Stamp changed his mind, and the original cover was reinstated.\n\n\n=== Death and tributes ===\nStamp died on 17 August 2025, at the age of 87. Filmmaker Edgar Wright, who directed him in his final screen role Last Night in Soho (2021), wrote in part, \"Terence was kind, funny, and endlessly fascinating. I loved ... reminiscing about his films, going back to his debut in Billy Budd. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back\". Others who paid tribute included Guy Pearce, Gale Anne Hurd, Lou Diamond Phillips, Michael McKean, Billy Idol, and Stephan Elliott.\n\n\n== Acting credits and accolades ==\n\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Memoirs and reflections ===\nStamp, Terence (1987).

        "title": "Utrecht",
        "content": "Utrecht ( YOO-trekt; Dutch: [ˈytrɛxt] ; Utrecht dialect: Ut(e)reg [ˈyt(ə)ʁɛχ]) is the fourth-largest city of the Netherlands, as well as the capital and the most populous city of the province of Utrecht. The municipality of Utrecht is located in the eastern part of the Randstad conurbation, in the very centre of mainland Netherlands, and includes Haarzuilens, Vleuten and De Meern. It has a population of 376,435 as of January 2025.\nUtrecht's ancient city centre features many buildings and structures, several dating as far back as the High Middle Ages. It has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the 8th century. In 1579, the Union of Utrecht was signed in the city to lay the foundations for the Dutch Republic. Utrecht was the most important city in the Netherlands until the Dutch Golden Age, when it was surpassed by Amsterdam as the country's cultural centre and most populous city.\nUtrecht is home to Utrecht University, the largest university in the Netherlands, as well as several other institutions of higher education. Due to its central position within the country, it is an important hub for both rail and road transport; it has the busiest railway station in the Netherlands, Utrecht Centraal. It has the second-highest number of cultural events in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam. In 2012, Lonely Planet included Utrecht in the top 10 of the world's unsung places.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins (before 650 CE) ===\n\nAlthough there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Stone Age (app. 2200 BCE) and settling in the Bronze Age (app. 1800–800 BCE), the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a Roman fortification (castellum), probably built in around 50 CE. A series of such fortresses were built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand further north. To consolidate the border, the Limes Germanicus defense line was constructed along the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time traversed a more northern route (now known as the Kromme Rijn, Crooked Rhine) compared to today's Rhine flow. These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers. Near the fort, settlements grew that housed artisans, traders and soldiers' wives and children.\nIn Roman times, the name of the Utrecht fortress was simply Traiectum, denoting its location at a possible Rhine crossing. Traiectum became Dutch Trecht; with the U from Old Dutch \"uut\" (downriver) added to distinguish U-trecht from Maas-tricht, on the river Meuse. In 11th-century official documents, it was Latinized as Ultra Traiectum. Around the year 200, the wooden walls of the fortification were replaced by sturdier tuff stone walls, remnants of which are still to be found below the buildings around Dom Square.\nFrom the middle of the 3rd century, Germanic tribes regularly invaded the Roman territories. After around 275 the Romans could no longer maintain the northern border, and Utrecht was abandoned. Little is known about the period from 270 to 650. Utrecht is first spoken of again several centuries after the Romans left. Under the influence of the growing realms of the Franks, during Dagobert I's reign in the 7th century, a church was built within the walls of the Roman fortress. In ongoing border conflicts with the Frisians, this first church was destroyed.\n\n\n=== Centre of Christianity in the Netherlands (650–1579) ===\n\nBy the mid-7th century, British, English and Irish missionaries set out to convert the Frisians. Pope Sergius I appointed their leader, Saint Willibrordus, as bishop of the Frisians. The tenure of Willibrordus is generally considered to be the beginning of the Bishopric of Utrecht. In 723, the Frankish leader Charles Martel bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops. From then on Utrecht became one of the most influential seats of power for the Catholic Church in the Netherlands. The archbishops of Utrecht were based at the uneasy northern border of the Carolingian Empire. In addition, the city of Utrecht had competition from the nearby trading centre Dorestad. After the fall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands. The importance of Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrecht-born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens as pope in 1522 (the last non-Italian pope before John Paul II).\n\n\n==== Prince-bishops ====\n\nWhen the Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism, the Bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops. The territory of the bishopric not only included the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower Sticht'), but also extended to the northeast. The feudal conflict of the Middle Ages heavily affected Utrecht. The prince-bishopric was involved in almost continuous conflicts with the Counts of Holland and the Dukes of Guelders. The Veluwe region was seized by Guelders, but large areas in the modern province of Overijssel remained as the Oversticht.\n\n\n==== Religious buildings ====\nSeveral churches and monasteries were built inside, or close to, the city of Utrecht. The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire. The choir and transept were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious Dom tower. The last part to be constructed was the central nave, from 1420. By that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished.\nBesides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht: St. Salvator's Church (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century. Saint John (Janskerk), originating in 1040; Saint Peter, building started in 1039 and Saint Mary's church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives).\nBesides these churches, the city housed St. Paul's Abbey, the 15th-century beguinage of St. Nicholas, and a 14th-century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights.\nBesides these buildings which belonged to the bishopric, an additional four parish churches were constructed in the city: the Jacobikerk (dedicated to Saint James), founded in the 11th century, with the current Gothic church dating back to the 14th century; the Buurkerk (Neighbourhood-church) of the 11th-century parish in the centre of the city; Nicolaichurch (dedicated to Saint Nicholas), from the 12th century, and the 13th-century Geertekerk (dedicated to Saint Gertrude of Nivelles).\n\n\n==== City of Utrecht ====\nIts location on the banks of the river Rhine allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands. The growing town was granted city rights by Henry V at Utrecht on 2 June 1122. When the main flow of the Rhine moved south, the old bed which still flowed through the heart of the town became ever more canalized; and the wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system. On the wharfs, storage facilities (werfkelders) were built, on top of which the main street, including houses, was constructed. The wharfs and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure. The relations between the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy. The bishop, for example dammed the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding. This threatened shipping for the city and led the city of Utrecht to commission a canal to ensure access to the town for shipping trade: the Vaartse Rijn, connecting Utrecht to the Hollandse IJssel at IJsselstein.\n\n\n==== The end of independence ====\nIn 1528 the bishop lost secular power over both Neder- and Oversticht—which included the city of Utrecht—to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Charles V combined the Seventeen Provinces (the current Benelux and the northern parts of France) as a personal union. This ended the prince-bishopric of Utrecht, as the secular rule was now the lordship of Utrecht, with the religious power remaining with the bishop, although Charles V had gained the right to appoint new bishops. In 1559 the bishopric of Utrecht was raised to archbishopric to make it the religious centre of the Northern ecclesiastical province in the Seventeen Provinces.\nThe transition from independence to a relatively minor part of a larger union was not easily accepted. To quell uprisings, Charles V struggled to exert his power over the city's citizens who had struggled to gain a certain level of independence from the bishops and were not willing to cede this to their new lord. The heavily fortified castle Vredenburg was built to house a large garrison whose main task was to maintain control over the city. The castle would last less than 50 years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the Dutch Revolt.\n\n\n=== Republic of the Netherlands (1579–1806) ===\n\nIn 1579 the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht treaty (Dutch: Unie van Utrecht), in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic. In 1580, the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the archbishopric of Utrecht. The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic, shifting the power towards its dominant province Holland. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht. Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic being about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more so among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.\nThe fortified city temporarily fell to the French invasion in 1672 (the Disaster Year, Dutch: Rampjaar). The French invasion was stopped just west of Utrecht at the Old Hollandic Waterline. In 1674, only two years after the French left, the centre of Utrecht was struck by a tornado. The halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the cathedral of St Martin church's central section which collapsed, creating the current Dom square between the tower and choir. In 1713, Utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the Treaty of Utrecht settled the War of the Spanish Succession. Beginning in 1723, Utrecht became the centre of the non-Roman Old Catholic Churches in the world.\n\n\n=== Modern history (1815–present) ===\n\nIn the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete. The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the Industrial Revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond its medieval centre. When the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome in 1853, Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward, neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle-class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theatre (1941).\n\nDuring World War II, Utrecht was held by German forces until the general German surrender of the Netherlands on 5 May 1945. British and Canadian troops that had surrounded the city entered it after that surrender, on 7 May 1945. Following the end of World War II, the city grew considerably when new neighbourhoods such as Overvecht, Kanaleneiland, Hoograven and Lunetten were built. Around 2000, the Leidsche Rijn area was developed as an extension of the city to the west.\n\nThe area surrounding Utrecht Centraal railway station and the station itself were developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s, in a brutalist style. This development led to the construction of the shopping mall Hoog Catharijne, the music centre Vredenburg (Hertzberger, 1979), and conversion of part of the ancient canal structure into a highway (Catherijnebaan). Protest against further modernisation of the city centre followed even before the last buildings were finalised. In the early 21st century, the whole area is undergoing change again. The redeveloped music centre TivoliVredenburg opened in 2014 with the original Vredenburg and Tivoli concert and rock and jazz halls brought together in a single building.  \n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUtrecht experiences a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) similar to all of the Netherlands.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nUtrecht city had a population of 361,924 in 2022. It is a growing municipality and projections are that the population will surpass 392,000 by 2025.\nUtrecht has a young population, with many inhabitants in the age category from 20 and 30 years, due to the presence of a large university. About 52% of the population is female, 48% is male. The majority of households (52.5%) in Utrecht are single-person households. About 29% of people living in Utrecht are either married, or have another legal partnership. About 3% of the population of Utrecht is divorced.\n\n\n=== Inhabitants by origin ===\n\nFor 62.8% of the population of Utrecht both parents were born in the Netherlands. Approximately 12.4% of the population consists of people with a recent migration background from Western countries, while 24.8% of the population has at least one parent who is of 'non-Western origin' (8.8% from Morocco, 4% Turkey, 3% Surinam and Dutch Caribbean and 9.1% of other countries). \n\n\n=== Religion ===\nUtrecht has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the 8th century. Currently it is the see of the Metropolitan Archbishop of Utrecht, the most senior Dutch Roman Catholic leader. His ecclesiastical province covers the whole kingdom.\nUtrecht is also the see of the archbishop of the Old Catholic Church, titular head of the Union of Utrecht, and the location of the offices of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, the main Dutch Protestant church.\nAs of 2013, the largest religion is Christianity with 28% of the population being Christian, followed by Islam with 9.9% in 2016 and Hinduism with 0.8%.\n\n\n=== Population centres and agglomeration ===\nThe city of Utrecht is subdivided into 10 city quarters, all of which have their own neighbourhood council and service centre for civil affairs.\n\nBinnenstad\nOost\nLeidsche Rijn\nWest\nOvervecht\nZuid\nNoordoost\nZuidwest\nNoordwest\nVleuten-De Meern\nUtrecht is the centre of a densely populated area, a fact which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult, and somewhat arbitrary. The smaller Utrecht agglomeration of continuously built-up areas counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes Nieuwegein, IJsselstein and Maarssen. It is sometimes argued that the close by municipalities De Bilt, Zeist, Houten, Vianen, Driebergen-Rijsenburg (Utrechtse Heuvelrug), and Bunnik should also be counted towards the Utrecht agglomeration, bringing the total to 640,000 inhabitants. The larger region, including slightly more remote cities such as Woerden and Amersfoort, counts up to 820,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nUtrecht's cityscape is dominated by the Dom Tower, the tallest belfry in the Netherlands and originally part of the Cathedral of Saint Martin. An ongoing debate is over whether any building in or near the centre of town should surpass the Dom Tower in height (112 m [367 ft]). Nevertheless, some tall buildings are now being constructed that will become part of the skyline of Utrecht. The second-tallest building of the city, the Rabobank-tower, was completed in 2010 and stands 105 m (344 ft) tall. Two antennas will increase that height to 120 m (394 ft). Two other buildings were constructed around the Nieuw Galgenwaard stadium (2007). These buildings, the 'Kantoortoren Galghenwert' and 'Apollo Residence', stand 85.5 m (280.5 ft) and 64.5 m (211.6 ft) high, respectively.\nThe former Utrecht Main Post Office, built in 1924, is still in the city centre at Neude square, but is now serving as library, see also Utrecht Post Office.\nAnother landmark is the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city. The Oudegracht is a curved canal, partly following the ancient main branch of the Rhine. It is lined with the unique wharf-basement structures that create a two-level street along the canals. The inner city has largely retained its medieval structure, and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact. In the 1970s part of the moat was converted into a motorway. It was then converted back into a waterway, the work being finished in 2020.\nBecause of the role of Utrecht as a fortified city, construction outside the medieval centre and its city walls was restricted until the 19th century. Surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late-19th- and early-20th-century neighbourhoods, with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out. The eastern part of Utrecht remains fairly open. The Dutch Water Line, moved east of the city in the early 19th century, required open lines of fire, thus prohibiting all permanent constructions until the middle of the 20th century on the east side of the city.\nDue to the past importance of Utrecht as a religious centre, several monumental churches were erected, many of which have survived. Most prominent is the Dom Church. Other notable churches include the romanesque St Peter's and St John's churches; the gothic churches of St James and St Nicholas; and the Buurkerk, now converted into a museum for automatically playing musical instruments.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nBecause of its central location, Utrecht is well connected to the rest of the Netherlands and has a well-developed public transport network.\n\n\n==== Heavy rail ====\n\nUtrecht Centraal is the main railway station of Utrecht and is the largest in the country. There are regular intercity services to all major Dutch cities, including direct services to Schiphol Airport. Utrecht Centraal is a station on the night service, providing an all-night service to (among others) Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, seven days a week. International InterCityExpress (ICE) services to Germany through Arnhem call at Utrecht Centraal. Regular local trains to all areas surrounding Utrecht also depart from Utrecht Centraal; and service several smaller stations: Utrecht Lunetten; Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn; Utrecht Overvecht; Utrecht Leidsche Rijn; Utrecht Terwijde; Utrecht Zuilen and Vleuten. A former station Utrecht Maliebaan closed in 1939 and has since been converted into the Dutch Railway Museum.\nUtrecht is the location of the headquarters of Nederlandse Spoorwegen (English: Dutch Railways), the largest rail operator in the Netherlands, and ProRail, the state-owned company responsible for the construction and maintenance of the country's rail infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Light rail ====\nThe Utrecht sneltram is a light rail system with three routes connecting Utrecht Centraal railway station to the suburbs of IJsselstein and Nieuwegein and to the Uithof district. The sneltram began operations in 1983 and is currently operated under the U-OV brand by the private transport company Qbuzz. The system has a total length 18.3 km and 54 trainsets. It carried over 9 million riders in 2023.\nUtrecht is the only city among the four largest in the Netherlands (the others being Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam) that awards a public transportation concession by tender. Qbuzz will hold that concession until December 2025 after which Transdev will take it over until 2035.\n\n\n==== Bus transport ====\nUtrecht Centraal railway station also serves local and regional buses at its west side (Centrumzijde) and at its east side (Jaarbuursplein), where both sides have connections to the Utrecht sneltram. Fifty local bus routes are operated by Qbuzz under the U-OV brand until December 2025 when Transdev will take over the concession. The local bus fleet is one of Europe's cleanest, using only buses compliant with the Euro-VI standard as well as electric buses for inner-city transport. The plan is that all buses be zero-emission by 2028. Regional buses from the city are operated by Arriva.\nThe Utrecht Centraal railway station is also served by the pan-European services of Eurolines. Furthermore, it acts as departure and arrival place of many coach companies serving holiday resorts in Spain and France—and during winter in Austria and Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nLike most Dutch cities, Utrecht has an extensive network of cycle paths, making cycling safe and popular. 51% of journeys within the city are by bicycle, more than any other mode of transport. Bicycles are used by young and old people, and by individuals and families. They are mostly traditional, upright, steel-framed bicycles, with few gears. There are also bucket bikes for carrying cargo such as groceries or small children. Thanks in part to the access provided by bicycles, 100% of the population lives in a 15-minute city and more than 90% can get to the major destination types within 10 minutes. \nIn 2014, the city council decided to build the world's largest bicycle parking station, near the Central Railway Station. This three-floor construction cost over €30 million and can hold 12,500 bicycles. The bicycle parking station was built in stages, with the first part opening in August 2017, and the final section (after some delay) being opened on 19 August 2019.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nUtrecht is well-connected to the Dutch road network. Two of the most important major roads serve the city of Utrecht: the A12 and A2 motorways connect Amsterdam, Arnhem, The Hague and Maastricht, as well as Belgium and Germany. Other major motorways in the area are the Almere–Breda A27 and the Utrecht–Groningen A28. Due to the increasing traffic and the ancient city plan, traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around Utrecht, causing elevated levels of air pollutants. This has led to a passionate debate in the city about the best way to improve the city's air quality.\n\n\n=== Shipping ===\nUtrecht has an industrial port located on the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. The container terminal has a capacity of 80,000 containers a year. In 2003, the port facilitated the transport of four million tons of cargo; mostly sand, gravel, fertiliser and fodder. Additionally, some tourist boat trips are organised from various places on the Oudegracht; and the city is connected to touristic shipping routes through sluices.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nProduction industry constitutes a small part of the economy of Utrecht. The economy of Utrecht depends for a large part on the several large institutions located in the city. It is the centre of the Dutch railway network and the location of the head office of Nederlandse Spoorwegen. ProRail is headquartered in De Inktpot (The Inkwell), the largest brick building in the Netherlands (the \"UFO\" featured on its façade stems from an art program in 2000). Rabobank, a large bank, has its headquarters in Utrecht.\nUtrecht is also informally considered the \"capital\" of the Dutch games industry. It was named by Business Finland in 2023 as one of several capitals for the European games industry as a whole. Utrecht's influence in this field was caused by video game development courses at its universities, which were the first such courses in Europe when launched in 2002. Since 2008 Utrecht has also been home to the studio incubator program Dutch Game Garden, which has launched a number of studios in the area. By 2014 the program had created 200 jobs. Utrecht is also home to Nixxes Software (a PlayStation Studios subsidiary) as well as Sokpop Collective.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nUtrecht hosts several large institutions of higher education. The most prominent of these is Utrecht University (est. 1636), the largest university of the Netherlands with 30,449 students (as of 2012). The university is partially based in the inner city as well as in the Uithof campus area, on the east side of the city. According to Shanghai Jiaotong University's university ranking in 2014, it is the 57th-best university in the world. Utrecht also houses the much smaller University of Humanistic Studies, which houses about 400 students.\nUtrecht is home of one of the locations of TIAS School for Business and Society, focused on post-experience management education and the largest management school of its kind in the Netherlands. In 2008, its executive MBA program was rated the 24th best program in the world by the Financial Times.\nUtrecht is also home to two other large institutions of higher education: the vocational university Hogeschool Utrecht (37,000 students), with locations in the city and the Uithof campus; and the HKU Utrecht School of the Arts (3,000 students).\nThere are many schools for primary and secondary education, allowing parents to select from different philosophies and religions in the school as is inherent in the Dutch school system.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nUtrecht city has an active cultural life, and in the Netherlands is second only to Amsterdam. There are several theatres and theatre companies. The 1941 main city theatre was built by Dudok. In addition to theatres, there is a large number of cinemas including three arthouse cinemas. Utrecht is host to the international Early Music Festival (Festival Oude Muziek, for music before 1800) and the Netherlands Film Festival. The city has an important classical music hall Vredenburg (1979 by Herman Hertzberger). Its acoustics are considered among the best of the 20th-century original music halls. The original Vredenburg music hall has been redeveloped as part of the larger station area redevelopment plan and in 2014 gained additional halls that allowed its merger with the rock club Tivoli and the SJU jazzpodium. There are several other venues for music throughout the city. Young musicians are educated in the conservatory, a department of the Utrecht School of the Arts. There is a specialised museum of automatically playing musical instruments.\n\nThere are many art galleries in Utrecht. There are also several foundations to support art and artists. Training of artists is done at the Utrecht School of the Arts. The Centraal Museum has many exhibitions on the arts, including a permanent exhibition on the works of Utrecht resident illustrator Dick Bruna, who is best known for creating Miffy (\"Nijntje\", in Dutch). BAK, [Dutch: \"Basis voor Actuele Kunst,\" Basis for Contemporary Art] offers contemporary art exhibitions and public events, as well as a Fellowship program for practitioners involved in contemporary arts, theory and activisms. Although street art is illegal in Utrecht, the Utrechtse Kabouter, a picture of a gnome with a red hat, became a common sight in 2004. Utrecht also houses one of the landmarks of modern architecture, the 1924 Rietveld Schröder House, which is listed on UNESCO's World Heritage Sites.\nEvery Saturday, a paviour adds another letter to The Letters of Utrecht, an endless poem in the cobblestones of the Oude Gracht in Utrecht. With the Letters, Utrecht has a social sculpture as a growing monument created for the benefit of future people.\nTo promote culture, Utrecht city organizes cultural Sundays. During a thematic Sunday, several organisations create a program which is open to everyone without, or with a substantially reduced, admission fee. There are also initiatives for amateur artists. The city subsidises an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants (Utrechts Centrum voor de Kunsten), as does the university for its staff and students. Additionally there are also several private initiatives. The city council provides coupons for discounts to inhabitants who receive welfare to be used with many of the initiatives.\nIn 2017, Utrecht was named as a UNESCO City of Literature. In 2025 the national literature museum will move from the Hague to Utrecht.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nUtrecht is home to the premier league (professional) football club FC Utrecht, which plays in Stadium Nieuw Galgenwaard. It is also the home of Kampong, the largest (amateur) sportsclub in the Netherlands (4,500 members), SV Kampong. Kampong features field hockey, association football, cricket, tennis, squash and boules. Kampong's men and women top hockey squads play in the highest Dutch hockey league, the Rabohoofdklasse. Utrecht is also home to baseball and softball club UVV, which plays in the highest Dutch baseball league: de Hoofdklasse. The rugby culture in Utrecht is carried by the USRS, that has been playing in the highest leagues of the Dutch rugby pyramid since 1967. Utrecht's waterways are used by several rowing clubs. Viking is a large club open to the general public, and the student clubs Orca and Triton compete in the Varsity each year.\nIn July 2013, Utrecht hosted the European Youth Olympic Festival, in which more than 2,000 young athletes competed in nine Olympic sports. In July 2015, Utrecht hosted the Grand Départ and first stage of the Tour de France.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nUtrecht has several smaller and larger museums. Many of those are located in the southern part of the old town, the Museumkwartier.\n\nAboriginal Art Museum, located at the Oudegracht and closed since 15 June 2017, this museum had a small exhibit of Australian Aboriginal Art\nBAK, basis voor actuele kunst, an international platform for theoretically-informed, politically driven art and experimental research\nCentraal Museum, located in the MuseumQuarter, this municipal museum has a large collection of art, design, and historical artifacts;\nDick Bruna huis, art of Centraal Museum on this separate location is dedicated to Miffy creator Dick Bruna.\nDuitse Huis has a collection of historical items including many charters with seals dating from as far back as the early 13th century and a collection of medieval coins.\nMuseum Catharijneconvent, Museum of the Catholic Church shows the history of Christian culture and arts in the Netherlands;\nMuseum Speelklok National Museum in the centre of the city, displays several centuries of mechanical musical instruments;\nRailway Museum (Nederlands Spoorwegmuseum) Railway sponsored museum on the history of the Dutch railways;\nUtrecht Archives, are located at Hamburgerstraat 28 in Utrecht;\nUtrecht university museum Utrecht University museum includes the ancient botanical garden;\nVolksbuurtmuseum Wijk C\nSonnenborgh Observatory observatory and museum that regularly hosts lectures on astronomy, located at Zonnenburg 2 in Utrecht;\nBetje Boerhave Museum museum for the grocer's shop where people can buy old-fashioned food and non-food items, located at Hoogt 6 in Utrecht.\n\n\n=== Music and events ===\nThe city has several music venues such as TivoliVredenburg, Tivoli De Helling, ACU, Moira, EKKO, dB's and RASA. Utrecht hosts the yearly Utrecht Early Music Festival (Festival Oude Muziek). Several Editions of the Thunderdome, a large gabber music event, have been held in Jaarbeurs Utrecht. The city also hosts Trance Energy there. Every summer there used to be the Summer Darkness festival, which celebrated goth culture and music. In November the Le Guess Who? festival, focused on indie rock, art rock and experimental rock, takes place in many of the city's venues.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nThere are two main theatres in the city, the Theater Kikker and the Stadsschouwburg Utrecht. De Parade, a travelling theatre festival, performs in Utrecht in summer. The city also hosts the yearly Festival aan de Werf which offers a selection of contemporary international theatre, together with visual arts, public art and music.\n\n\n== Notable people from Utrecht ==\n\nSee also the category People from Utrecht\nOver the ages famous people have been born or raised in Utrecht.\nAmong the most famous Utrechters are:\n\nPope Adrian VI (1459–1523), head of the Catholic Church\nLouis Andriessen (1939–2021), composer\nMarco van Basten (born 1964), football player\nDick Bruna (1927–2017), writer and illustrator (Miffy)\nC.H.D.

        "title": "Durrës",
        "content": "Durrës ( DUURR-əs, Albanian: [ˈdurəs]; Albanian definite form: Durrësi) is the second most populous city of the Republic of Albania and seat of Durrës County and Durrës Municipality. It is one of Albania's oldest continuously inhabited cities, with roughly 2,500 years of recorded history. It is located on a flat plain along the Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast between the mouths of the Erzen and Ishëm at the southeastern corner of the Adriatic Sea. Durrës's climate is profoundly influenced by a seasonal Mediterranean climate.\nDurrës was founded under the name of Epidamnos around the 7th century BC, by ancient Greek colonists from Corinth and Corcyra in cooperation with the Taulantii, a local Illyrian tribe. Also known as Dyrrachium, Durrës developed as it became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor the Byzantine Empire. The Via Egnatia started in the city and led east across the fields, lowlands and highlands of the Balkan Peninsula to Constantinople.\nIn the Middle Ages, Durrës was contested between Bulgarians, Venetians, local Albanian noble families, and the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed, ruling the city for more than 400 years from 1501 until 1912. Following the Albanian Declaration of Independence, the city served as the capital of the Principality of Albania for a short period of time. Subsequently, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Italy in the interwar period and was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. Durrës experienced a strong expansion in its demography and economic activity under the People's Socialist Republic of Albania.\nThe transport connections, concentration of economic institutions and industrial tradition underlie Durrës's leading economic position in Albania. It is served by the Port of Durrës, one of the largest on the Adriatic Sea, which connects the city to other neighbouring countries. Its most considerable attraction is the Amphitheatre of Durrës that is included on the Albanian tentative list for designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Once having a capacity for 20,000 people, it is the largest amphitheatre in the Balkan Peninsula.\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn antiquity, the city was known as Epidamnos (Ἐπίδαμνος) and Dyrrhachion (Δυρράχιον) in classical Greek and then Epidamnus and Dyrrachium in classical Latin. Epidamnos is the older known of the two toponyms; it is widely considered to be of Illyrian origin, as first proposed by linguist Hans Krahe, and is attested in Thucydides (5th century BC), Aristotle (4th century BC), and Polybius (2nd century BC). Etymologically, Epidamnos may be related to Proto-Albanian *dami (cub, young animal, young bull) > dem (modern Albanian) as proposed by linguist Eqrem Çabej. Although the name Epidamnos/Epidamnus was more commonly used among Ancient Greek authors, the coinage of the city only used the abbreviations for the name Dyrrhachion/Dyrrhachium. Dyrrachium was chosen as the sole name of the city after the Roman Republic gained control of the region after the Illyrian Wars in 229 BC. The Latin spelling of /y/ retained the form of Doric Greek Dyrrhachion, which was pronounced as /Durrakhion/. This change of the name is already attested in classical literature. Titus Livius, at the end of the first century BC, writes in Ab Urbe Condita Libri that at the time of the Illyrian Wars (roughly 200 years earlier), the city was not known as Dyrrachium, but as Epidamnus. Pomponius Mela, about 70 years later than Titus Livius, attributed the change of the name to the fact that the name Epidamnos reminded the Romans of the Latin word damnum, which signified evil and bad luck; Pliny the Elder, who lived in the same period, repeated this explanation in his works. However, the Romans may have adopted the new name because it was already in more frequent use by citizens of the city.\nThe name Dyrrhachion is usually explained as a Greek compound from δυσ- 'bad' and ῥαχία 'rocky shore, flood, roaring waves', an explanation already hinted at in antiquity by Cassius Dio, who writes it referred to the difficulties of the rocky coastline, while also reporting that other Roman authors linked it to the name of an eponymous hero Dyrrachius. The mythological construction of the city's name was recorded by Appian (2nd century AD), who wrote that \"the king of the barbarians of this country, Epidamnus, gave the name to the city. His daughter's son Dyrrachius, built a port near the town that he called Dyrrachium\". Stephanus of Byzantium repeated this mythological construction in his work. It is unclear whether the two toponyms referred originally to different areas of the territory of the city or whether they referred to the same territory. Classical literature indicates that they more probably referred to different neighbouring areas originally. Gradually, the name Epidamnus fell out of use, and Dyrrachium became the sole name for the city. Archaeological research has shown that at the time of the foundation of Durrës, two distinct settlements existed on its territory. The first one is a hill site with no direct contact with the sea. It predates the colony and might represent the settlement that held the toponym known as Epidamnos in ancient literature. The hill site overlooks to its south the second site, which is the territory of the port of Durrës, where the colony was founded. Its location on a rocky shore struck by waves on all sides reflects the description of the toponym Dyrrhachion. The distinction between these two districts of the city remained in place even much later. In the 19th century, Durrës proper was the district of the port, while the hill north of it was a separate settlement, Stani (Kodra e Stanit).\nThe modern names of the city in Albanian (Durrës) and Italian (Durazzo, Italian pronunciation: [duˈrattso]) are derived from Dyrrachium/Dyrrachion. An intermediate, palatalized antecedent is found in the form Dyrratio, attested in the early centuries AD. The palatalized /-tio/ ending probably represents a phonetic change in the way the inhabitants of the city pronounced its name. The preservation of old Doric /u/ indicates that the modern name derives from populations to whom the toponym was known in its original Doric pronunciation. By contrast, in Byzantine Greek, the name of the city is pronounced with the much later evolution of /u/ as /i/. The modern Italian name evolved in the sub-dialects that emerged from Colloquial Latin in northern Italy. The modern Albanian name evolved independently from the parent language of Albanian around the same period of the post-Roman era in the first centuries AD, as the difference in stress in the two toponyms (first syllable in Albanian, second in Italian) highlights. In Aromanian, the city is known as Durus. During the 411-year Ottoman period, Durrës was known in Ottoman Turkish as Dırac (دراج); with final consonant devoicing, the name has evolved into modern Turkish as Dıraç. In Venetian, it is called Durazo, while in the South Slavic languages, the city is known as Drač (Cyrillic Драч).\nIn English usage, the Italian form Durazzo used to be widespread, but the local Albanian name Durrës has gradually replaced it in recent decades.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earliest period ===\nThe territory of Durrës was populated at least starting from the Eneolithic and then, from protohistoric times, it was inhabited by Illyrian peoples.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThough surviving remains are minimal, Durrës is one of the oldest cities in Albania. In terms of mythology, the genealogy of the foundation of Dyrrhachium includes among the founders Illyrian men (the Illyrian king Epidamnos and his grandson Dyrrachos), Greek men (the Corinthian Falio, descendant of Heracles), heroes (Heracles who was given part of the lands) and gods (Poseidon, as father of Dyrrachos).\nSeveral ancient people held the site: the presence of the Brygi appears to be confirmed by several ancient writers, the Illyrian Taulantii (their arrival has been estimated to have happened not later than the 10th century BC), probably the Liburni who expanded southwards in the 9th century BC. The city was founded by Greek colonists in 627 BC on the coast of the Taulantii. According to ancient authors, the Greek colonists helped the Taulantii to expel Liburnians and mixed with the local population establishing the Greek element to the port. A flourishing commercial centre emerged and the city grew rapidly. The fact that about the 6th century BC the citizens of Epidamnus constructed a Doric-style treasury at Olympia confirms that the city was among the richest of the Ancient Greek world. An ancient account describes Epidamnos as 'a great power and very populated' city.\n\nAfter 323 BC Epidamnus-Dyrrhachium was involved in the intervention in Illyria of the Macedonians under Cassander, who clashed with the Illyrians under Glaukias. In 314 BC the Macedonian king seized the city but the garrison he established there was in turn besieged and driven out by the Illyrian king and the Corcyrans. In 312 BC, after another unsuccessful attack of Cassander in the region, the city came under the protection of Glaukias. Those events marked the end of Macedonian presence on the Adriatic coast for almost one century. The city probably came under the control of Pyrrhus of Epirus at the beginning of the 3rd century BC. From about 280 BC the Illyrian king Monunius, and his successor Mytilos minted in Dyrrhachion silver and bronze coins respectively, bearing the king's name and the symbol of the city. The fact that their coins were struck in the city mint of Dyrrhachion stresses that they exercised to some extent their authority over the city.\nEpidamnus came under the control of the Illyrian Ardiaei under Agron, who fortified the city (c. 250–231 BC). When the Romans defeated the Illyrians, they replaced the rule of queen Teuta with that of Demetrius of Pharos, one of her generals. He lost his kingdom, including Epidamnus, to the Romans in 219 BC at the Second Illyrian War. In the Third Illyrian War Epidamnus was attacked by Gentius but he was defeated by the Romans at the same year.\n\nFor Catullus, the city was Durrachium Hadriae tabernam, \"the taberna of the Adriatic\", one of the stopping places for a Roman traveling up the Adriatic, as Catullus had done himself in the sailing season of 56.\nAfter the Illyrian Wars with the Roman Republic in 229 BC ended in a decisive defeat for the Illyrians, the city passed to Roman rule, under which it was developed as a major military and naval base. The Romans preferred to use the name Dyrrachium (Greek: Δυρράχιον / Dyrrhachion) for the city. They considered the name Epidamnos to be inauspicious because of its wholly coincidental similarities with the Latin word damnum, meaning \"loss\" or \"harm\". The meaning of Dyrrachium (\"bad spine\" or \"difficult ridge\" in Greek) is unclear, but it has been suggested that it refers to the imposing cliffs near the city. During the Great Roman Civil War in Illyria, the Battle of Dyrrachium was undertaken by Julius Caesar against Gnaeus Pompey. The battle was a victory for Pompey, but it preceded the more decisive Battle of Pharsalus in Greece where Caesar won. Under Roman rule, Dyrrachium prospered; it became the western end of the Via Egnatia, the great Roman road that led to Thessalonica and on to Constantinople. Another lesser road led south to the city of Buthrotum, the modern Butrint. The Roman emperor Caesar Augustus made the city a colony for veterans of his legions following the Battle of Actium, proclaiming it a civitas libera (free town).\nIn the 4th century, Dyrrachium was made the capital of the Roman province of Epirus nova. It was the birthplace of the emperor Anastasius I in c. 430. Sometime later that century, Dyrrachium was struck by a powerful earthquake which destroyed the city's defences. Anastasius I rebuilt and strengthened the city walls, thus creating the strongest fortifications in the western Balkans. The 12-metre-high (39-foot) walls were so thick that, according to the Byzantine historian Anna Komnene, four horsemen could ride abreast on them. Significant portions of the ancient city defences still remain, although they have been much reduced over the centuries.\n\nLike much of the rest of the Balkans, Dyrrachium and the surrounding Dyrraciensis provinciae suffered considerably from barbarian incursions during the Migrations Period. It was besieged in 481 by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, and in subsequent centuries had to fend off frequent attacks by the Bulgarians. Unaffected by the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city continued under the Byzantine Empire as an important port and a major link between the Empire and western Europe. During the sixth century based on accounts of Procopius, the city was mainly inhabited by a Greek population.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe city and the surrounding coast became a Byzantine province, the Theme of Dyrrhachium, probably in the first decade of the 9th century. Durrës became a Christian city quite early on; its bishopric was created around 58 and was raised to the status of an archbishopric in 449. It was also the seat of an Orthodox metropolitan bishop. The city remained in Byzantine hands until the late 10th century, when control passed to Samuel of Bulgaria, possibly through his marriage with Agatha, daughter of the local magnate John Chryselios. Samuel made his son-in-law Ashot Taronites, a Byzantine captive who had married his daughter Miroslava, governor of Durrës. In circa 1005, however, Ashot and Miroslava, with the connivance of Chryselios, fled to Constantinople, where they notified Emperor Basil II of their intention to surrender the city to him. Soon a Byzantine squadron under Eustathios Daphnomeles arrived at Durrës, and the city returned to Byzantine rule.\n\nIn the 11th–12th centuries, the city was important as a military stronghold and a metropolitan see rather than as a major economic center, and never recovered its late antique prosperity; Anna Komnene makes clear that medieval Dyrrhachium occupied only a portion of the ancient city. In the 1070s, two of its governors, Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder and Nikephoros Basilakes, led unsuccessful rebellions trying to seize the Byzantine throne. Dyrrachium was lost in February 1082 when Alexios I Komnenos was defeated by the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemund in the Battle of Dyrrhachium. Byzantine control was restored a few years later, but the Normans under Bohemund returned to besiege it in 1107–08, and sacked it again in 1185 under King William II of Sicily.\nIn 1205, after the Fourth Crusade, the city was transferred to the rule of the Republic of Venice, which formed the \"Duchy of Durazzo\". This Duchy was conquered in 1213 and the city taken by the Despotate of Epirus under Michael I Komnenos Doukas. In 1257, Durrës was briefly occupied by the King of Sicily, Manfred of Hohenstaufen. It was re-occupied by the Despot of Epirus Michael II Komnenos Doukas until 1259, when the Despotate was defeated by the Byzantine Empire of Nicaea in the Battle of Pelagonia. In the 1270s, Durrës was again controlled by Epirus under Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, the son of Michael II, who in 1278 was forced to yield the city to Charles d' Anjou (Charles I of Sicily). In c. 1273, it was wrecked by a devastating earthquake (according to George Pachymeres) but soon recovered. It was briefly occupied by King Milutin of Serbia in 1296. In the thirteenth century, a Jewish community existed in Durrës and was employed in the salt trade.\nIn the early 14th century, the city was ruled by a coalition of Anjous, Hungarians, and Albanians of the Thopia family. In 1317 or 1318, the area was taken by the Serbs and remained under their rule until the 1350s. At that time the Popes, supported by the Anjous, increased their diplomatic and political activity in the area, by using the Latin bishops, including the archbishop of Durrës. The city had been a religious center of Catholicism after the Anjou were installed in Durrës. In 1272, a Catholic archbishop was installed, and until the mid-14th century there were both Catholic and Orthodox archbishops of Durrës.\nTwo Irish pilgrims who visited Albania on their way to Jerusalem in 1322, reported that Durrës was \"inhabited by Latins, Greeks, perfidious Jews and barbaric Albanians\".\nWhen the Serbian Tsar Dušan died in 1355, the city passed into the hands of the Albanian family of Thopias. In 1376 the Navarrese Company under Louis of Évreux, Duke of Durazzo, who had gained the rights on the Kingdom of Albania from his second wife, attacked and conquered the city, but in 1383 Karl Topia regained control of the city. The Republic of Venice regained control in 1392 from Gjergj Thopia and retained the city, known as Durazzo in those years, as part of the Albania Veneta. It fended off a siege by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1466 but fell to Ottoman forces in 1501.\n\n\n=== Ottoman period (to 1912) ===\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, many of its inhabitants converted to Islam and many mosques were erected. The city was renamed Dırac (دراج) but did not prosper in the first two centuries of the Ottoman era; its importance declined greatly and it became a den of piracy. Following the establishment of Ottoman rule in 1501, the Durrës Jewish community experienced population growth.\n\nAs a port, Durrës was of little importance to the Ottomans, who controlled the entire Albanian coast. The town's main significance rather lay in its strategic castle, which the Turks reinforced and improved upon, and its rich salt deposits. There were few permanent civilian settlements, and most of the population, including the local kadı, opted to live further inland, such as in the newly established town of Kavajë, 14 km south of Durrës. The Ottoman chronicler Evliya Çelebi visited Durrës in 1670-71 and noted in his Seyahatname that there were around 150 houses as well as a mosque named after Sultan Bayezid II.\nThe city's economy began to recover from the late 17th century onwards, boosted by profits from the salt mines, which exported salt throughout the Balkan hinterland. According to diplomat and Turkologist François Pouqueville, about 100 Turkish and Greek merchants lived in the city in 1699, exporting 3,000 quintals (300 tons) of beeswax, 15,000 quintals (1,500 tons) of finished cloth, 15,000 pieces of fine leather, and 60-100 ships of wheat, barley, corn and millet to Venice every year despite an official prohibition from the central government in Constantinople. France, England, the Netherlands, and Austria established their consulates in Durrës in 1700.\nAs Ottoman relations with Venice improved upon the conclusion of the Ottoman-Venetian Wars, Durrës became a focal point of trade with the Republic of Venice, especially in grains and olive oil, as reported by the Venetian consul in the city in 1769. Mercantile relations with Venice were halted when the latter city was occupied by Napoleonic forces in 1797, bringing an end to the maritime republic. The Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary, via the port of Trieste, then replaced Venice as Durrës's largest trading partner. According to contemporary statistician Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden, total exports from Durrës reached 672,000 Austrian thalers each year, while imports amounted to 455,000 thalers.\nBy the mid-19th century, its population was said to have been about 1,000 people living in some 200 households. In the late nineteenth century, Durrës contained 1,200 Orthodox Aromanians (130 families) who lived among the larger population of Muslim Albanians alongside a significant number of Catholic Albanians. The decrepitude of Durrës was noted by foreign observers in the early 20th century, echoing comments made by the Ottoman cartographer Piri Reis almost 400 years before: \"The walls are dilapidated; plane-trees grow on the gigantic ruins of its old Byzantine citadel; and its harbour, once equally commodious and safe, is gradually becoming silted up.\"\n\nDuring the Tanzimat (reform) era, Durrës was separated from the Sanjak of Elbasan and became a main administrative centre in the reorganised İşkodra Vilayet before 1912; it had its own sanjak, namely the Sanjak of Durrës, which was established in 1880 within the vilayet. With the city's economic prosperity and upgrade in status, its demographic decline was also reversed. Many government buildings were built, as well as Western-style hotels and restaurants for private businesses. In 1892-1893 the population of the kaza of Durrës grew to about 4,781, consisting of 3,018 Muslims, 1,514 Orthodox, 201 Catholics, and 48 foreigners.\nOn 26 November 1912, as the Ottoman Empire was embroiled in the First Balkan War, a group of nationalists led by Ismail Qemali raised the Albanian flag over Durrës. Albania declared independence two days later, bringing four centuries of Turkish rule in Durrës to an end.\n\n\n=== Modern ===\n\nDurrës was an active city in the Albanian national liberation movement in the periods 1878–1881 and 1910–1912. Ismail Qemali raised the Albanian flag on 26 November 1912 but the city was occupied by the Kingdom of Serbia three days later during the First Balkan War. On 29 November 1912 Durrës became the county town of the Durrës County one of the counties of the Kingdom of Serbia established on the part of the territory of Albania occupied from Ottoman Empire. The Durrës County had four districts: Durrës, Lezha, Elbasan and Tirana. The army of the Kingdom of Serbia retreated from Durrës in April 1913. The city became Albania's second national capital (after Vlorë) on 7 March 1914 under the brief rule of Prince Wilhelm, Prince of Albania. It remained Albania's capital until 11 February 1920, when the Congress of Lushnjë made Tirana the new capital.\nDuring the First World War, the city was occupied by Italy in 1915 and by Austria-Hungary in 1916–1918. On 29 December 1915, a Naval Battle was fought off Durazzo. On 2 October 1918, several allied ships bombarded Durazzo and attacked the few Austrian ships in the harbour. Although civilians started to flee the city at the start of the bombardment, many casualties were inflicted on the innocent and neutral population. The Old City being adjacent to the harbour was largely destroyed, including the Royal Palace of Durrës and other primary public buildings. It was captured by Italian troops on 16 October 1918. Restored to Albanian sovereignty, Durrës became the country's temporary capital between 1918 and March 1920. It experienced an economic boom due to Italian investments and developed into a major seaport under the rule of King Zog, with a modern harbour being constructed in 1927. It was at this time the Royal Villa of Durrës was built by Zog as a summer palace, that still dominates the skyline from a hill close to the old city.\n\nAn earthquake in 1926 damaged some of the city and the rebuilding that followed gave the city its more modern appearance. During the 1930s, the Bank of Athens had a branch in the city. \nDurrës (called Durazzo again in Italian) and the rest of Albania were occupied in April 1939 and annexed to the Kingdom of Italy until 1943, then occupied by Nazi Germany until autumn 1944. Durrës's strategic value as a seaport made it a high-profile military target for both sides. It was the site of the initial Italian landings on 7 April 1939 (and was fiercely defended by Mujo Ulqinaku) as well as the launch point for the ill-fated Italian invasion of Greece. The city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during the war and the port installations were blown up by retreating German soldiers in autumn 1944.\n\nThe Communist regime of Enver Hoxha rapidly rebuilt the city following the war, establishing a variety of heavy industries in the area and expanding the port. It became the terminus of Albania's first railway, begun in 1947 (Durrës–Tirana railway). In the late 1980s, the city was briefly renamed Durrës-Enver Hoxha. The city was and continues to remain the center of Albanian mass beach tourism.\nFollowing the collapse of communist rule in 1990, Durrës became the focus of mass emigrations from Albania with ships being hijacked in the harbour and sailed at gunpoint to Italy. In one month alone, August 1991, over 20,000 people migrated to Italy in this fashion. Italy intervened militarily, putting the port area under its control, and the city became the center of the European Community's \"Operation Pelican\", a food-aid program.\nIn 1997, Albania slid into anarchy following the collapse of a massive pyramid scheme which devastated the national economy. An Italian-led peacekeeping force was controversially deployed to Durrës and other Albanian cities to restore order, although there were widespread suggestions that the real purpose of \"Operation Alba\" was to prevent economic refugees continuing to use Albania's ports as a route to migrate to Italy.\nFollowing the start of the 21st century, Durrës has been revitalized as many streets were repaved, while parks and façades experienced a face lift.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDurrës is located on the Bay of Durrës on a flat alluvial plain between the river mouths of Erzen and the Ishëm along the Adriatic Sea within the Mediterranean Sea. The municipality of Durrës is encompassed in the County of Durrës within the Northern Region of Albania and consists of the adjacent administrative units of Ishëm, Katund i Ri, Manëz, Rrashbull, Sukth and Durrës as its seat. It stretches from the mouth of Ishëm River at the Cape of Rodon in the north across the Bay of Lalzi to the Shkëmbi i Kavajës in the south.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Durrës is classified under the periphery of the hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) zone with an average annual temperature of 15.9 °C (60.6 °F). Its climate is influenced by its proximity to the Adriatic Sea in the Mediterranean Sea and the hills in the Western Lowlands in the hinterlands. The summers are predominantly hot and dry, the winters relatively mild, and falls and springs mainly stable, in terms of precipitation and temperatures. The mean monthly temperature ranges between 7.5 °C (45.5 °F) in winter to 23.8 °C (74.8 °F) in summer. The highest temperature of 39 °C (102 °F) was recorded on 14 August 1957. The lowest temperature of −6.2 °C (20.8 °F) was registered on 26 January 1954. Durrës receives most of the precipitation in winter months and less in summer months. The mean annual precipitation ranges between 1,000 millimetres (39 inches) and 1,273 millimetres (50.1 inches).\n\n\n== Politics ==\nDurrës is a municipality governed by a mayor–council system with the mayor of Durrës and the members of the Durrës Municipal Council being responsible for the administration of Durrës Municipality. The mayor of Durrës is elected by its people to act as the executive officer of the municipality. The Durrës Municipal Council is the legislative body of the municipality and is also a democratically elected institution, comprising 51 councillors since the latest municipal election. Both, the mayor and members of the municipal council serve four-year terms without term limits.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDurrës is an important link to Western Europe due to its port and its proximity to the Italian port cities, notably Bari, to which daily ferries run. As well as the dockyard, it also possesses an important shipyard and manufacturing industries, notably producing leather, plastic and tobacco products.\nThe southern coastal stretch of Golem is renowned for its traditional mass beach tourism having experienced uncontrolled urban development. The city's beaches are also a popular destination for many foreign and local tourists. In 2012, new water sanitation systems are being installed to eliminate sea water pollution. In contrast, the northern coastal stretch of Lalzit Bay is mostly unspoiled and set to become an elite tourism destination as a number of beach resorts are being built since 2009. Neighboring districts are known for the production of good wine and a variety of foodstuffs.\nAccording to the World Bank, Durrës has made significant steps of starting a business in 2016. Durrës ranks ninth among 22 cities in Southeastern Europe before the capital Tirana, Belgrade, Serbia and Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nMajor roads and railways pass through the city of Durrës thank to its significant location and connect the northern part of the country to the south and the west with the east. Durrës is the starting point of Pan-European Corridor VIII, national roads SH2 and SH4, and serves as the main railway station of the Albanian Railways (HSH).\nThe Pan-European Corridor VIII is one of the Pan-European corridors. It runs between Durrës, at the Adriatic coast, and Varna, at the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. The National Road 2 (SH2) begins at the Port of Durrës at the Dajlani Overpass, bypasses the road to Tirana International Airport, and ends at the Kamza Overpass in the outskirts of Tirana where it meets National Road 1 (SH1) State Road heading to northern Albania. The Albania–Kosovo Highway is a four-lane highway constructed from 2006 to 2013 between Albania and Kosovo. As part of the South-East European Route 7, the highway will connect the Adriatic Sea ports of Durrës via Pristina, with the E75/Corridor X near Niš, Serbia. As most tourists come through Kosovo, the laying of the highway make it easier to travel to Durrës.\nThe Port of Durrës, in the south-west of the city, is one of the major ports of the Adriatic Sea and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port is located on an artificial basin that is formed between two moles, with a west-northwesterly oriented entrance approximately wide as it passes between the ends of the moles. The port is also a key location for transit networks and passenger ferry, giving Durrës a strategic position with respect to the Pan-European Corridor VIII. The port has experienced major upgrades in recent years culminating with the opening of the new terminal in July 2012. In 2012, The Globe and Mail ranked Durrës at no. 1 among 8 exciting new cruise ports to explore. It is one of the largest passenger port on the Adriatic Sea that handle more than 1.5 million passengers per year.\nThe railway station of Durrës is connected to other cities in Albania, including the capital of Tirana, Vlorë, Elbasan and Shkodër. The Durrës–Tirana railway was a 38-kilometre (24-mile) railway line which joined the two biggest cities in Albania: Durrës and Tirana. The line connects to the Shkodër–Vorë railway halfway in Vorë, and to the Durrës–Vlorë railway in Durrës. In 2015, some rail stations and rolling stock along the Durrës-Tirana line are being upgraded and latter colored red and white.\nA rail connection between Durrës and Pristina in Kosovo was proposed in 2021, with a feasibility study being prepared in 2022.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nDurrës is the second most populous municipality in Albania and one of the most populous on the Adriatic Sea with a growing number of inhabitants. According to the 2011 census, the municipal unit of Durrës had an estimated population of 113,249 of whom 56,511 were men and 56,738 women.\nIslam was introduced to the city in the early 16th century during the Ottoman conquest. Much of the local population converted to Islam during the four centuries of Ottoman rule. The two most well-known mosques in the city are the Great Mosque of Durrës (built in 1931 on the site of an earlier Ottoman mosque) and the Fatih Mosque, erected in 1502 just one year after the city became part of the Ottoman Empire.\nChristianity in Durrës and elsewhere in Albania has a presence dating back to classical antiquity. Christian traditions relate that the archbishopric of Durrës was founded by the apostle Paul while he was preaching in Illyria and Epirus and that there were possibly about seventy Christian families in the city as early as the time of the apostles. The Orthodox Church of Albania, which has been autocephalous since 1923, was divided into the archbishopric of Tirana–Durrës, headed by the Metropolitan and sub-divided into the local church districts of Tirana, Durrës, Shkodër and Elbasan.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe theatrical and musical life of the city is centered on the Aleksandër Moisiu Theatre, the Estrada Theatre, a puppet theatre, and the Philharmonic Orchestra. The annual International Film Summerfest of Durrës, founded in 2008, is held in late August or early September in the amphitheatre. In 2004 and 2009, Miss Globe International was held in Durrës.\nThe city is home to different architectural styles that represent influential periods in its history. The architecture is influenced by Illyrian, Greek, Roman and Italian architecture. In the 21st century, part of Durrës turned into a modernist city, with large blocks of flats, modern new buildings, new shopping centres and many green spaces.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nDurrës has a long tradition of education since the beginning of civil life from antiquity until today. After the fall of communism in Albania, a reorganization plan was announced in 1990, that would extend the compulsory education program from eight to ten years. The following year, major economic and political crisis in Albania, and the ensuing breakdown of public order, plunged the school system into chaos. Later, many schools were rebuilt or reconstructed, to improve learning conditions especially in larger cities of the country. Durrës is host to academic institutions such as the University of Durrës, Albanian College of Durrës, Kajtazi Brothers Educational Institute, Gjergj Kastrioti High School, Naim Frashëri High School, sports mastery school Benardina Qerraxhiu and Jani Kukuzeli Artistic Lycée.\nOne of the city's main sights is the Byzantine city wall, also called Durrës Castle, while the largest amphitheatre in the Balkans is close to the city's harbour. This fifth-century construction is currently under consideration for listing as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDurrës is home to the largest archaeological museum in the country, the Durrës Archaeological Museum, located near the beach. North of the museum are the sixth-century Byzantine walls constructed after the Visigoth invasion of 481. The bulk of the museum's collection comprises artefacts from the nearby ancient site of Dyrrhachium and includes an extensive collection from the Illyrian, Ancient Greek, Hellenistic and Roman periods. Items of major note include Roman funeral steles and stone sarcophagi, a colourful elliptical mosaic measuring 17 by 10 feet (5 m × 3 m), known as The Beauty of Durrës, and a collection of miniature busts of Venus, testament to the time when Durrës was a centre of worship of the goddess. There are several other museums including the Royal Villa of Durrës and the Museum of History (in the house of the actor Aleksandër Moisiu).\n\n\n== International relations ==\nIn 2008, Bosnia and Herzegovina opened a consulate in the city considering that there is a community with Bosniak ancestry that lives in Durrës County.

        "title": "Instagram",
        "content": "Instagram is an American photo and short-form video sharing social networking service owned by Meta Platforms. It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed. A Meta-operated image-centric social media platform, it is available on iOS, Android, Windows 10, and the web. Users can take photos and edit them using built-in filters and other tools, then share them on other social media platforms like Facebook. It supports 33 languages including English, Hindi, Spanish, French, Korean, and Japanese.\nInstagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor, Snapchat, which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories was used by 500 million people daily.\n\nInstagram was launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and the Brazilian software engineer Mike Krieger. It rapidly gained popularity, reaching 1 million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion in June 2018. In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android version of Instagram was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, an app for Windows 10 in October 2016, and an app for iPadOS in September 2025. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nInstagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn. Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users. They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.\n\n\n=== 2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding ===\n\nJosh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager, Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer, and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.\n\nThe first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 p.m. on July 16, 2010. On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store. In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million (equivalent to $9,357,057 in 2023) in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo. The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million. In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million (equivalent to $65,610,000 in 2023) from venture capitalists with a valuation of $500 million (equivalent to $656,100,000 in 2023). Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.\n\n\n=== 2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook ===\nOn April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones, and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day. The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements; then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were \"exploring an iOS version\". On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1 billion (equivalent to $1,312,000,000 in 2023) in cash and stock, with a plan to keep the company independently managed. Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012, and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed. On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.\nThe deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN. The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005. Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was \"committed to building and growing Instagram independently\". According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400 million.\n\nIn November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality, as well as a selection of badges, and web widget buttons to link to profiles. Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.\n\n\n=== 2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app ===\n\nIn June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website. Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The slideshow banner on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.\n\nIn April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app, after years of demand from Microsoft and the public to release an app for the platform. The platform previously had a beta version of Instagram, first released on November 21, 2013, for Windows Phone 8. The new app added support for videos (viewing and creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and direct messages. Similarly, an app for Windows 10 personal computers and tablets was released in October 2016. In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a \"lightweight\" version of the Explore tab.\nOn May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design theme for the app's user interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more abstract, \"modern\" and colorful icon. Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when The Verge received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept. On December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally decide to deactivate comments on a post.\nThe mobile website allows uploading pictures since May 4, 2017. Image filters and the ability to upload videos were not introduced then. On April 30, 2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile website remains available as a progressive web application (PWA) with limited functionality. The app remains available on Windows 10 computers and tablets, also updated to a PWA in 2020.\n\n\n=== 2018–2019: IGTV, removal of the like counter, management changes ===\nTo comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users to download an archive of their user data in April 2018. IGTV launched on June 20, 2018, as a standalone video application. The application was shut down and removed from app stores in March 2022, citing low usage and a shift to short-form video content. On September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they would be stepping down from Instagram. On October 1, 2018, it was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of Instagram.\nDuring Facebook F8, it was announced that Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of publicly displayed \"like\" counts for content posted by other users. Like counts would only be visible to the user who originally posted the content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users \"worry a little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about.\" It has been argued that low numbers of likes in relativity to others could contribute to a lower self-esteem in users. The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other markets in July. The pilot was expanded worldwide in November 2019. Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that it would implement new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the service.\nIn August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the \"Following\" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused and that some users were \"surprised\" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner. Instagram later restricted the ability to view public profiles without logging in, prompting users to sign in after viewing a limited number of posts. Following the change, after viewing a number of posts a pop-up requires the user to log in to continue viewing content.\nIn the same month, Instagram launched a separate app known as Threads. Similar to Snapchat, the app allowed users to communicate through messaging and video chats. It was integrated with Instagram's \"Close friends\" feature, so that users could send images, photos, and texts privately to others, and also had Instagram's photo editing system embedded into the app. However, Instagram discontinued this version of Threads in December 2021, mainly due to most of its features being rolled out on Instagram itself, as well as low usage compared to other social media applications. Threads was not well-received among Instagram's user base. Since its launch, only approximately 220,000 users globally downloaded the app, which represented less than 0.1% of Instagram's monthly active users, indicating a lack of success in driving adoption.\n\n\n=== 2020–present ===\n\nIn March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \"Co-Watching\". The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn August 2020, Instagram began a pivot to video, introducing a new feature called \"Reels\". The intent was to compete with the video-sharing site TikTok. Instagram also added suggested posts in August 2020. After scrolling through posts from the past 48 hours, Instagram displays posts related to their interests from accounts they do not follow. In February 2021, Instagram began testing a new feature called Vertical Stories, said by some sources to be inspired by TikTok. The same month, they also began testing the removal of ability to share feed posts to stories. In March 2021, Instagram launched a new feature in which four people can go live at once. Instagram also announced that adults would not be allowed to message teens who don't follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.\nIn May 2021, Instagram began allowing users in some regions to add pronouns to their profile page. On October 4, 2021, Meta services suffered their worst outage since 2008, bringing down Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Security experts identified the problem as possibly being DNS-related. On March 17, 2022, Zuckerberg confirmed plans to add non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the platform.\nIn April 2022, Instagram began testing the removal of the ability to see \"recent\" posts from various hashtags. This change became permanent and system wide a year later, and now hashtags can only be used to see a selection of curated content from \"top\" users. These changes are ostensibly an attempt to hinder the spread of misinformation, while Instagram has also repeatedly stated that hashtags do not help posts get views.\nIn September 2022, Ireland's Data Protection Commission fined the company $402 million under privacy laws recently adopted by the European Union over how it handled the privacy data of minors. After being trialled in mid-2022, Instagram introduced Notes in December 2022. This feature allows users to share updates as short text posts of up to 60 characters with certain people, who can then reply to them using messaging on Instagram.\nIn February 2023, Instagram introduced a new feature allowing users to browse and post GIFs in their comments. Also in February 2023, Zuckerberg announced that Meta would start selling blue \"verified\" badges on Instagram and Facebook.\nOn July 5, 2023, Meta launched Threads, a social network platform connected to Instagram that allows users to make public shortform blog posts comprising text, photos, and videos, as well as to converse with other users and reblog other users' posts. Threads aims to compete with Twitter. In December 2023, Instagram launched a podcast titled \"Close Friends Only\" featuring conversations among celebrities. The first episode featured rappers Ice Spice and Doja Cat. Subsequent episodes in June and August 2024 featured Reneé Rapp, Rachel Sennott, Megan Thee Stallion and GloRilla.\n\nIn April 2024, Instagram announced that they would start testing new tools \"within weeks\" to fight sextortion, a form of blackmail involving intimate pictures sent online. On August 2, 2024, Turkey blocked Instagram after the platform deleted posts from users offering condolences for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. In December 2024, Instagram and MTA collaborated and sold Metrocards ft. creators such as New York Nico, Overheard In New York, and SubwayTakes.\nOn September 3, 2025, Instagram launched a native iPadOS app, which before relied on the iOS app and did not utilize the larger screen size of tablets. \n\n\n== Features and tools ==\n\nUsers can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, and geotag images with the name of a location. Users can set their account as \"private\", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests. Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites. In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt–shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon. Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well. Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos. The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage.\nSince December 2016, posts can be \"saved\" into a private area of the app. The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into named collections. Users can also \"archive\" their posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of \"likes\" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the \"emergent behavior\" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content. In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies.\nSince February 2017, up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel. The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead. In April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called \"focus mode\", which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected. In November, Instagram began to support Alt text to add descriptions of photos for the visually impaired. They are either generated automatically using object recognition (using existing Facebook technology) or manually specified by the uploader.\nOn March 1, 2021, Instagram launched a new feature named Instagram Live Rooms, which lets four people go live together. In May 2021, Instagram announced a new accessibility feature for videos on Instagram Reels and Stories to allow creators to place closed captions on their content.\n\n\n=== Hashtags ===\nIn January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other. Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like \"photo\", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.\nUsers on Instagram have created \"trends\" through hashtags. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment.\nIn December 2017, Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags, which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds. The ability to search \"Recent\" hashtags was temporarily disabled during the 2020 U.S. elections, to prevent the spread of misinformation. In 2022 this was again tested on some users, and in April 2023 the ability to search recent hashtags was removed entirely. Now, users are only able to see a curated selection of \"popular\" posts using a given hashtag. Instagram said that this is to prevent abuse and so that hashtags do not help users gain views, but it has been noted that using hashtags is the only free method for a user to reach past their existing followers.\n\n\n=== Explore ===\nIn June 2012, Instagram introduced \"Explore\", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search. The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations. In April 2016, Instagram added a \"Videos You Might Like\" channel to the tab, followed by an \"Events\" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events, followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October. The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically curated page of the \"best\" Instagram Live videos currently airing. In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places.\n\n\n=== Photographic filters ===\nInstagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images. In February 2012, Instagram added a \"Lux\" filter, an effect that \"lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast\". In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters added to the Instagram filter family.\n\n\n=== Video ===\nInitially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013. The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine. In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos. In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to one minute. Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.\n\n\n==== IGTV ====\n\nIGTV was a vertical video application launched by Instagram in June 2018. Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website. IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to one hour in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB. The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video. In March 2022, the application was shut down.\n\n\n==== Edits ====\n\n\n=== Instagram Reels ===\n\nInstagram Reels is the short-form section of the American social media platform Instagram. Reels focuses on vertical videos that are less than 90 seconds of duration and various features for user interaction. As of November 2024 Reels average collectively 150 billion views a day,  Creators earn money based on the amount of views they receive, or through ad revenue. The increased popularity of Instagram Reels has led to concerns about addiction for teenagers.\nIn November 2019, it was announced that Instagram would start to roll out a new feature to Brazil known as Instagram Reels. It would then expand to France and Germany. Instagram Reels was officially launched in Pakistan in August 2022, two years after its global rollout in August 2020. It functions similarly to the Chinese video service TikTok, focusing on allowing users to create short videos already set to  existing sounds from other clips. Users could make up to 15 (later 30) second videos using this feature. Reels also uses existing Instagram filters and editing tools.\nIn July 2020, Instagram rolled out Reels to India after TikTok was banned in the country. Then, the following month, Reels officially launched in 50 countries including the United States, Canada and United Kingdom. Then in August of that year, Instagram introduced a reels button on the home page. On June 17, 2021, Instagram launched full-screen advertisements in Reels. The ads are similar to regular reels and can run up to 30 seconds. They are distinguished from regular content by the \"sponsored\" tag under the account name. Despite the \"TikTokification\" of Reels and the parent company Meta spending millions on courting content creators, user engagement continued to lag way behind TikTok as of 2022. Then Instagram started rolling out a new feature with made Reels up to 90 seconds long beginning in June 2022. After a period of testing, a duration of up to three minutes was announced in January 2025.\nOn February 26, 2025, Instagram Reels came under fire after numerous users reported a sudden surge in violent and graphic content appearing in their feeds. Meta issued a public apology, stating that a technical error led to the unintended recommendation of such content. A Meta spokesperson explained, \"We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content in their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended. We apologize for the mistake.\"\nSince its inception in 2020, the usage of Instagram Reels  has continuously increased. In September 2022, Instagram Reels generated over 140 billion views daily. The number of monthly users also increased from 1.5 billion in 2022 to 1.8 billion as of 2024. Researchers from the Guizhou University of Finance and Economics and Western Michigan University found that short-form videos like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels may make it easier for young adults and children to develop addictive behavior because short-form videos provide \"short bursts of thrills\". These researchers found that college students in the U.S. and China watch short-form videos for entertainment, knowledge, and to build social identities.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that some parents are concerned about the effects of short-form videos on their children, as there is no way to disable Instagram or set limits. When children watch short-form videos, they learn to expect continual stimulation and fast-paced changes, which can cause problems when engaging in activities that require greater focus, such as reading. Recent studies highlighted the connection between short-form videos such as Instagram Reels and the brain's reward system, specifically dopamine release. According to Dr. Anna Lembke, a psychiatrist and chief of Stanford University's dual diagnosis addiction clinic, brief attention-grabbing videos act as powerful stimuli triggering dopamine surges akin to other addictive behaviors. The rapid and easily consumable nature of short-form videos can elicit high levels of dopamine; since dopamine serves as a motivator rather than a direct source of pleasure, individuals are compelled to seek rewarding activities and become addicted to them. Such neurochemical responses lead to addictive patterns and behaviors, entering a vicious cycle. Digital addiction can lead to shorter attention spans and slower cognitive processing.\n\n\n=== Instagram Direct ===\nIn December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging (colloquially called \"DM\" OR \"DMs\"; in some regions, the messages may be known simply as \"direct\"/\"directs\"). Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people. The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation. A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \"disappear\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot.\nIn April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads. In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping.\nIn April 2020, Direct became accessible from the Instagram website, allowing users to send direct messages from a web version using WebSocket technology. In August 2020, Facebook started merging Instagram Direct into Facebook Messenger. After the update (which is rolled out to a segment of the user base) the Instagram Direct icon transforms into Facebook Messenger icon.\nIn March 2021, a feature was added that prevents adults from messaging users under 18 who do not follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies. In August 2023, Instagram introduced new adjustments to protect user privacy and prevent harassment and spam. Users can now only receive one direct message from accounts that they do not follow, and must approve the message request before further messages can be sent. This setting can be changed to allow unlimited messages from other accounts that the user does not follow.\nIn September 2024, Instagram added a sticker editor which allows users to cut out elements of photos and send them privately. It also enabled sticker addition and writing on photos.\n\n\n=== Instagram Stories ===\n\nIn August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat. In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told Recode that \"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \"fair\", Recode wrote that \"he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\". Systrom further stated that \"When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that.\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \"didn't have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\"\nIn November, Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending. In January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in-between different stories.\nIn April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a \"clone\" of Snapchat's functionality.\nIn May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters, letting users add specific visual features onto their faces. Later in May, TechCrunch reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place's Instagram page. A few days later, Instagram announced \"Story Search\", in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term.\nIn June 2017, Instagram revised its live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately. In July, Instagram started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos, complete with Instagram effects such as filters, stickers, and hashtags. Stories were made available for viewing on Instagram's mobile and desktop websites in late August 2017.\nOn December 5, 2017, Instagram introduced \"Story Highlights\", also known as \"Permanent Stories\", which are similar to Instagram Stories, but don't expire. They appear as circles below the profile picture and biography and are accessible from the desktop website as well. In June 2018, the daily active story users of Instagram had reached 400 million users, and monthly active users had reached 1 billion active users.\nIn December 2024, Instagram announced that it was trialing a feature designed to help users reconnect with content they may have missed from their mutual followers. This new functionality showcases unseen Story Highlights at the end of the Stories tray, which is situated at the top of the feed. By doing so, users can easily access curated Stories from the past week that they might not have seen previously. Importantly, this feature will only display Story Highlights—curated collections of Stories saved by users—rather than standard Stories that disappear after 24 hours. Users will only be able to view these Highlights after they have gone through all current Stories in their tray, meaning that those who follow many accounts may find it challenging to see these updates.\n\n\n=== Verified badges on Instagram ===\nInstagram introduced a verification feature, known as the blue verified badge, in December 2014. The feature allows users to verify their accounts to confirm their authenticity.\nInstagram began allowing users to request verification for their accounts in August 2018. This marked a significant shift from the previous system where verification was typically initiated by Instagram itself for accounts it deemed to be of public interest or high-profile. With the introduction of this feature, eligible users could apply for verification directly through the Instagram app.\nThe Instagram blue verified badge is a symbol displayed next to an account's name to signify that the account is authentic, credible, and belongs to a public figure, celebrity, brand, or entity of significant public interest. It helps users easily identify legitimate accounts amidst the vast number of profiles on the platform. The badge appears as a blue checkmark located next to the account's username in search results, profile pages, and comments.\nObtaining the blue verified badge typically requires meeting certain criteria set by Instagram, such as being notable, authentic, unique, complete, and adhering to the platform's terms of service and community guidelines. Instagram verifies accounts based on its own discretion, and not all accounts meeting the criteria may be verified. Users can apply for verification through Instagram's settings, but the decision to grant verification ultimately rests with Instagram's team.\nMeta (formerly Facebook) launched paid verification on Instagram in 2021. Paid verification allowed eligible Instagram users to request verification for their accounts via paying a fee, rather than relying solely on meeting the platform's traditional criteria for verification.\n\n\n=== Advertising ===\nEmily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April 2013. She said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company. White left Instagram in December 2013 to join Snapchat. In August 2014, James Quarles became Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, tasked with overseeing advertisement, sales efforts, and developing new \"monetization products\", according to a spokesperson.\nIn October 2013, Instagram announced that video and image ads would soon appear in feeds for users in the United States, with the first image advertisements displaying on November 1, 2013. Video ads followed nearly a year later on October 30, 2014. In June 2014, Instagram announced the rollout of ads in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, with ads starting to roll out that autumn. In March 2015, Instagram announced it would implement \"carousel ads\", allowing advertisers to display multiple images with options for linking to additional content. The company launched carousel image ads in October 2015, and video carousel ads in March 2016.\nIn February 2016, Instagram announced that it had 200,000 advertisers on the platform. This number increased to 500,000 by September 2016, and 1 million in March 2017. In May 2016, Instagram launched new tools for business accounts, including business profiles, analytics and the ability to promote posts as ads. To access the tools, businesses had to link a corresponding Facebook page. The new analytics page, known as Instagram Insights, allowed business accounts to view top posts, reach, impressions, engagement and demographic data. Insights rolled out first in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, and expanded to the rest of the world later in 2016.\nIn November 2018, Instagram added the ability for business accounts to add product links directing users to a purchase page or to save them to a \"shopping list\". In April 2019, Instagram added the option to \"Checkout on Instagram\", which allows merchants to sell products directly through the Instagram app. In March 2020, via a blog post, Instagram announced that they are making major moderation changes in order to decrease the flow of disinformation, hoaxes and fake news regarding COVID-19 on its platform, \"We'll remove COVID-19 accounts from account recommendations, and we are working to remove some COVID-19 related content from Explore unless posted by a credible health organization. We will also start to downrank content in feed and Stories that has been rated false by third-party fact-checkers.\"\nIn June 2021, Instagram launched a native affiliate marketing tool creators can use to earn commissions based on sales. Commission-enabled posts are labeled \"Eligible for Commission\" on the user side to identify them as affiliate posts. Launch partners included Sephora, MAC, and Kopari.\n\n\n=== Stand-alone apps ===\nInstagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality. In July 2014, it released Bolt, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen. It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses \"clever algorithm processing\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos. Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date. In October 2015, it released Boomerang, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop.\n\n\n=== Third-party services ===\nThe popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services designed to integrate with it, including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos (including physical print-outs), analytics, and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram (such as in the past, iPads).\nIn November 2015, Instagram announced that effective June 1, 2016, it would end \"feed\" API access to its platform in order to \"maintain control for the community and provide a clear roadmap for developers\" and \"set up a more sustainable environment built around authentic experiences on the platform\", including those oriented towards content creation, publishers, and advertisers. Additionally, third-party clients have been prohibited from using the text strings \"insta\" or \"gram\" in their name. It was reported that these changes were primarily intended to discourage third-party clients replicating the entire Instagram experience (due to increasing monetization of the service), and security reasons (such as preventing abuse by automated click farms, and the hijacking of accounts). In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Instagram began to impose further restrictions on its API in 2018.\nThird-party services can be used for unlimited browsing of public Instagram profiles without having to create an account, as well as for anonymous browsing of someone else's Stories. Stories are more authentic than typical photos posted as posts because users know that in 24 hours their Stories will disappear if they don't add them as highlighted (however users can check who saw their Story for 48 hours after it was published). For this reason, they are very valuable for market research.\n\n\n=== Fact-checking ===\nOn December 16, 2019, Facebook announced it would expand its fact-checking programs towards Instagram, by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information. Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such. With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation. If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false.\n\n\n=== Algorithm and design changes ===\nIn April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm. Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked, but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates. The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down, nor provide a way to change it back, which they reaffirmed in 2020. However, in December 2021, Adam Mosseri, in a Senate hearing on child safety issues, stated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order. He later clarified the company would introduce two modes: a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick \"favorite\" users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below.\nSince 2017, Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts (\"shadowbanning\") it believes may be generating non-genuine engagement and spam (including excessive use of unneeded hashtags), preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app's Explore section. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Instagram wrote that \"When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags\". Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances, particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material.\nInstagram caused the userbase to fall into outrage with the December 2018 update. They found an attempt to alter the flow of the feed from the traditional vertical scroll to emulate and piggy-back the popularity of their Instagram Stories with a horizontal scroll, by swiping left. Various backtracking statements were released explaining it as a bug, or as a test release that had been accidentally deployed to too large an audience.\nIn November 2020, Instagram replaced the activity feed tab with a new \"Shop\" tab, moving the activity feed to the top. The \"new post\" button was also relocated to the top and replaced with a Reels tab The company states that \"the Shop tab gives you a better way to connect with brands and creators and discover products you love\" and the Reels tab \"makes it easier for you to discover short, fun videos from creators all over the world and people just like you.\" However, users have not responded well to the change, taking their complaints to Twitter and Reddit, and The New York Times has shunned Reels in particular, saying \"Not only does Reels fail in every way as a TikTok clone, but it's confusing, frustrating and impossible to navigate\".\nAlso in 2020, Instagram rolled out a feature titled \"suggested posts\", which adds posts from accounts Instagram thinks a user would like to such user's feed. The feature was met with controversy from The Verge, which reported that suggested posts would keep users glued to their feed, give Instagram more advertising space, and ultimately harm the mental health of users, while Instagram executive Julian Gutman rebutted, stating the feature was not intended to keep users glued to their screens. Suggested posts received more controversy after Fast Company stated that the feature would be impossible to turn off.\nOn June 23, 2021, Instagram announced a test change to the \"suggested posts\" feature. The company will put suggested posts ahead of posts from people who the user is following in the Instagram feed, citing positive reception as the reason for this change.\n\n\n== Mental health ==\n\n\n=== Internal data from Meta ===\nIn 2021, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) obtained and published internal research Meta had conducted. The leak included presentations seen by company executives, and the findings mentioned CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2020.\nThe slides presented findings from three qualitative studies. The first interviewed 15 monthly Californian instagram users with low body image and self esteem, aged 13-21. The second recruited 10 monthly users for a 5-day diary study, where they recorded their online habits. The third selected 7 users from the diary study for a 30-minute interview. No study was designed to be a randomized controlled trial or Case-control, meaning they were incapable of drawing causal inferences. The WSJ reported that Instagram can worsen poor body image of young people, with girls particularly vulnerable. Instagram has had negative effects on the body image of one in three teenagers. Instagram makes 20% of the teens feel worse about themselves and 40% better about themselves. 70% of teen girls and 40% of teen boys experience negative social comparison. According to the research, Instagram has a higher impact on appearance comparison than TikTok or Snapchat. 13% of British and 6% of American teenager users with suicidal thoughts could trace them to Instagram use.\nInstagram responded to the story, saying it \"focused on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light.\" Meta defended not publishing its research, saying it was \"kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.\" In the wake of the backlash, Meta announced it had \"paused\" development of Instagram Kids. The company stated it was looking into concerns raised by the regulators and parents.\n\n\n=== Depression, anxiety and stress ===\nKhodarahimi & Fathi 2017 found evidence users displayed higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms compared to non-users. However, Frison & Eggermont 2017 found that, among boys and girls, browsing could predict depressive symptoms; liking and posting seemed to have no effect. Their study showed presence of depressive symptoms in a user could positively predict they would post. The study showed viewing celebrity and peer pictures could make the moods of women negative. In a 2021 study, Mun & Kim pointed out users with a strong need for approval were more likely to falsely present themselves, which increased the likelihood of depression.\nLub & Trub 2015 showed that following more strangers increases social comparisons and depressive symptoms. Multiple studies have found that increasing time spent on Instagram increases anxiety.\n\n\n=== Body image ===\nUsers report higher body surveillance (habitual monitoring of one's shape and size), appearance-related pressure, eating-disorder-related-pathology and lower body satisfaction than non-users. Studies have shown users who take more selfies before making a post, and those who strategically present themselves by editing selfies, report higher levels of body surveillance and body dissatisfaction, and lower esteem overall. Tiggermann et al. showed facial satisfaction can decrease when one spends greater time editing selfies. Comments related to appearance on Instagram can lead to higher dissatisfaction with one's body.\n\n\n=== Loneliness and social exclusion ===\nMackson et al. 2019 found users were less lonely than non-users and Instagram membership predicts lower self-reported loneliness. A 2021 study by Büttner & Rudertb showed that not being tagged in an Instagram photo triggers the feeling of social exclusion and ostracism, especially for those with higher needs to belong. However, Brailovskaia & Margraf 2018 found a significant positive relationship between Instagram membership and extraversion, life satisfaction, and social support. Their study showed only a marginally significant negative association between Instagram membership and self-conscientiousness. Fioravanti et al. 2020 showed that women who had to take a break from Instagram for seven days reported higher life satisfaction compared to women who continued their habitual use. No significant differences were observed for men. The relationship between Instagram use and the fear of missing out, or FOMO, has been confirmed in multiple studies. Research shows Instagram browsing predicts social comparison, which generates FOMO, which can lead to depression.\n\n\n=== Eating disorders ===\nA comparison of users with non-users showed boys with an account differ from boys without in terms of over-evaluation of their shape and weight, skipping meals, and levels of reported disordered eating cognitions. Girls with an account only differed from girls without in skipping meals; they also had a stricter exercise schedule, a pattern not found in boys. This suggests a possible negative effect of usage on body satisfaction and disordered eating for boys and girls. Appel et al. 2016 and Feltman et al. 2017 found a positive link between the intensity of Instagram use, body surveillance and disordered eating.\n\n\n=== Suicide and self-harm ===\nPicardo et al. 2020 examined the relationship between self-harm posts and actual self-harm offline and found such content had negative emotional effects on some users. The study reported evidence of online posts affecting offline behavior, but stopped short of claiming causality. Some benefits for those who engage with self-harm content have been suggested. Instagram has published resources to help users in need of support.\n\n\n=== Sharenting risks ===\n\nSharenting is when parents post content, including images, about their children. Instagram is one of the main sites for sharenting. The hashtag #letthembelittle contains over 10 million images related to children on Instagram. Bare 2020 analysed 300 randomly selected images under the hashtag and found they tended to contain children's personal information, including name, age and location.\n\n\n=== Addiction ===\nSanz-Blas et al. 2019 showed that users who feel they spend too much time on Instagram report higher levels of \"addiction\" to Instagram, which was related to higher levels of stress induced by the app. Foroughi et al. 2021 found that the desire for recognition and entertainment were predictors of students' addiction to Instagram. The study proved addiction to Instagram negatively affected academic performance. Gezgin & Mihci 2020 found frequent Instagram usage correlated with smartphone addiction.\n\n\n== User characteristics and behavior ==\n\n\n=== Users ===\n\nAfter being released in October 2010, Instagram had one million registered users in December 2010. In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users, which increased to 10 million in September. This growth continued to 30 million users in April 2012, 80 million in July 2012, 100 million in February 2013, 130 million in June 2013, 150 million in September 2013, 300 million in December 2014, 400 million in September 2015, 500 million in June 2016, 600 million in December 2016, 700 million in April 2017, and 800 million in September 2017.\nIn June 2011, Instagram passed 100 million photos uploaded to the service. This grew to 150 million in August 2011, and by June 2023, there were over 50 billion photos uploaded to the service. In October 2016, Instagram Stories reached 100 million active users, two months after launch. This increased to 150 million in January 2017, 200 million in April, surpassing Snapchat's user growth, and 250 million active users in June 2017.\nIn April 2017, Instagram Direct had 375 million monthly users.\n\n\n==== Demographics ====\nAs of 2014, Instagram's users are divided equally, with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners. While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female and 32% are male. Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas, as 17% of U.S. adults who live in urban areas use Instagram, while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so. While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo-sharing platforms, come from Instagram. Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation, with 90% of its 150 million users under the age of 35. From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users. With regards to income, 15% of U.S. Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000 and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so. With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram, with 23%. Following behind, college graduates consist of 18% and users with a high school diploma or less make up 15%. Among these Instagram users, 24% say they use the app several times a day.\n\n\n=== User behavior ===\nOngoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement. Past research has found that media which show people's faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement. Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and they are also more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content. Recently Instagram has come up with an option for users to apply for a verified account badge; however, this does not guarantee every user who applies will get the verified blue tick.\nThe motives for using Instagram among young people are mainly to look at posts, particularly for the sake of social interactions and recreation. In contrast, the level of agreement expressed in creating Instagram posts was lower, which demonstrates that Instagram's emphasis on visual communication is widely accepted by young people in social communication.\n\n\n=== Performative activism ===\nIn June 2020, because of the Black Lives Matter movement, Instagram became more widely used as a social justice platform. Instagram-based activism (as well as other social media) has been criticized and dismissed for being performative, reductionist, and overly focused on aesthetics.\n\n\n== Censorship and restricted content ==\nLike many social media sites, Instagram employs a combination of automated algorithms, user reports and human review to identify and remove illegal content such as child abuse and encouragement of terrorism. The system also aims to identify cyberbullying, hate speech and misinformation.\nAlthough the U.S. government has little direct power to force social media sites to remove specific content, Instagram has on occasion done so voluntarily, especially to avoid being seen as aiding the spread of fake news. On October 30, 2020, Instagram temporarily removed the \"recent\" tab on hashtag pages to prevent the spread of misinformation regarding the 2020 United States presidential election. On January 7, 2021, following the attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, Trump was banned from Instagram \"indefinitely\". Zuckerberg stated \"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\"\nInstagram has been criticized in India for not taking steps to counter homophobic and transphobic contents. According to the LGBT activist Indrajeet Ghorpade, \"Hateful homophobic content in English is removed but the same in Indian languages is allowed to remain on the platform... despite flagging the hateful and homophobic content to Instagram, no action has been taken.\" In 2023, a 16-year-old queer artist allegedly died by suicide after receiving thousands of hate comments on Instagram.\n\n\n=== Illicit drugs ===\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform. In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained:\n\nInstagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site. We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos.\nHowever, new incidents of illegal drug trade have occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 revelation, with Facebook, Inc., Instagram's parent company, asking users who come across such content to report the material, at which time a \"dedicated team\" reviews the information. In 2019, Facebook announced that influencers are no longer able to post any vape, tobacco products, and weapons promotions on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\n=== Women's bodies ===\nIn October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer Petra Collins after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom. Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it broke none of Instagram's terms and conditions. Audra Schroeder of The Daily Dot further wrote that \"Instagram's terms of use state users can't post 'pornographic or sexually suggestive photos.'\" You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of \"femininity\" the world is \"used to\" seeing and accepting.\" Nick Drewe of The Daily Beast wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy \"nonsensical and inconsistent\".\nSimilar incidents occurred in January 2015, when Instagram deleted Australian fashion agency Sticks and Stones Agency's account because of a photograph including pubic hair sticking out of bikini bottoms, and March 2015, when artist and poet Rupi Kaur's photos of menstrual blood on clothing were removed, prompting a rallying post on her Facebook and Tumblr accounts with the text \"We will not be censored\", gaining over 11,000 shares.\nThe incidents have led to a #FreetheNipple campaign, aimed at challenging Instagram's removal of photos displaying women's nipples. Although Instagram has not made many comments on the campaign, an October 2015 explanation from CEO Kevin Systrom highlighted Apple's content guidelines for apps published through its App Store, including Instagram, in which apps must designate the appropriate age ranking for users, with the app's current rating being 12+ years of age. However, this statement has also been called into question due to other apps with more explicit content allowed on the store, the lack of consequences for men exposing their bodies on Instagram, and for inconsistent treatment of what constitutes inappropriate exposure of the female body.\nThe Iranian government offered moderators bribes up to $9,000 to delete specific accounts, with Masih Alinejad being targeted in particular.\n\n\n=== Criticisms and controversies ===\nOn January 2020, after the Assassination of Qasem Soleimani by the United States, Instagram removed posts expressing support for General Soleimani. Instagram stated that this action with U.S. sanctions against Iran. Officials described the move as \" undemocratic”.\non May 2021, in The eviction of Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah, which became emblematic of the Israeli-Palestinian struggle over land rights, identity, and sovereignty in Jerusalem, Users, including journalists and human rights activists, reported that Instagram removed content, limited visibility (shadow banning), and restricted accounts referencing the potential eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem. Instagram denied intentional censorship and attributed the deletion of Palestinian posts to glitches. Digital rights groups such as 7amleh and Access Now argue that the removal of Palestinian content reflects broader issues of digital discrimination and have called for greater transparency from social media platforms.\nOn October 2023, Instagram labeled some users' profile bios as containing the term \"terrorist\" if they included the Palestinian flag emoji and the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah (Arabic: ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ, al-Ḥamdu lillāh),\" which means \"Praise be to God.\" The platform's automated translation system incorrectly interpreted the phrase as \"Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom.\" Instagram attributed the error to a computerized translation system, apologized, and corrected the translation.\n\n\n=== Censorship by countries ===\nCensorship has occurred in several countries.\n\n\n==== China ====\n\nInstagram has been blocked by China following the 2014 Hong Kong protests as many confrontations with police and incidents occurring during the protests were recorded and photographed. Hong Kong and Macau were not affected as they are part of special administrative regions of China. Sometimes the phrase \"Chinese Instagram\" is used to refer to Xiaohongshu, a competitor social media app which is not to be confused with Instagram.\n\n\n==== Cuba ====\nThe Cuban government blocked access to several social media platforms, including Instagram, to curb the spread of information during the 2021 Cuban protests.\n\n\n==== Iran ====\n\nInstagram was one of the last freely available global social media sites in Iran. According to the IFJ, Instagram is popular among Iranians because it is seen as an outlet for freedom and a \"window to the world\".\nStill, Iran has sentenced citizens to prison for posts made on their Instagram accounts. The Iranian government blocked Instagram periodically during anti-government protests in 2019-20. In July 2021, Instagram temporarily censored videos with the phrase \"death to Khamenei\".\nAs of September 2022, it was blocked permanently, along with WhatsApp, with an exception made for tourists and corporations who request its use.\n\n\n==== North Korea ====\n\nA few days after a fire incident that happened in the Koryo Hotel in North Korea on June 11, 2015, authorities blocked Instagram to prevent photos of the incident from being spread.\n\n\n==== Russia ====\nOn March 11, 2022, Russia announced it would ban Instagram due to alleged \"calls for violence against Russian troops\" on the platform during the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. On March 14, the ban took effect, with almost 80 million users losing access to Instagram.\n\n\n==== Turkey ====\nOn August 2, 2024, Instagram was banned by Information and Communication Technologies Authority (Turkey) after the Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The ban lasted for nine days and was lifted on August 10, 2024, with Instagram accepting the government's demands and agreeing to work with authorities.\n\n\n==== United States ====\nIn the U.S., there is relatively little government regulation of social media content, with most content removal taking place on a voluntary basis by the companies. One exception was in January 2020, when Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, Inc., removed posts \"that voice support for slain Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani to comply with US sanctions\".\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump in 2025, various sources noted possible censorship related to the Democratic Party on Instagram and other Meta platforms.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nInstagram was the runner-up for \"Best Mobile App\" at the 2010 TechCrunch Crunchies in January 2011. In May 2011, Fast Company listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\". In June 2011, Inc. included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \"30 Under 30\" list.\nInstagram won \"Best Locally Made App\" in the SF Weekly Web Awards in September 2011. 7x7Magazine's September 2011 issue featured Systrom and Krieger on the cover of their \"The Hot 20 2011\" issue. In December 2011, Apple Inc. named Instagram the \"App of the Year\" for 2011. In 2015, Instagram was named No. 1 by Mashable on its list of \"The 100 best iPhone apps of all time\", noting Instagram as \"one of the most influential social networks in the world.\" Instagram was listed among Time's \"50 Best Android Applications for 2013\" list.\n\n\n=== Mental health ===\n\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24 and asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\". Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building. In response to the survey, Instagram said that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\". The company filters out the reviews and accounts. If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them.\nIn 2017, researchers from Harvard University and University of Vermont demonstrated a machine learning tool that successfully outperformed general practitioners' diagnostic success rate for depression. The tool used color analysis, metadata components, and face detection of users' feeds. In 2019, Instagram began to test the hiding of like counts for posts made by its users, with the feature later made available to everyone. In 2021, Instagram announced that like counts would return to be publicly viewable by default. Users can choose to switch them off for their whole feed or on a per-post basis.\nCorrelations have been made between Instagram content and dissatisfaction with one's body, as a result of people comparing themselves to other users. In a recent survey, half of the applicants admitted to photo editing behavior which has been linked with concerns over body image. In October 2021, CNN published an article and interviews on two young women, Ashlee Thomas and Anastasia Vlasova, saying Instagram endangered their lives due to it having toxic effects on their diets.\nIn October, 2023, 42 U.S. states filed a lawsuit against Instagram and parent company Meta, accusing them of contributing to a youth mental health crisis due to the addictive nature of the platforms. The lawsuit claimed that Meta and its Instagram unit repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms and knowingly induced young children and teenagers into addictive and compulsive social media use. Meta representatives replied that they were disappointed with the lawsuit and were hoping instead to continue working with other companies from the industry to create new and better standards for applications teens use.\n\n\n==== Negative comments ====\nIn response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field. In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up. After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities, followed by regular users in September. In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers. In June 2017, Instagram announced that it would automatically attempt to filter offensive, harassing, and \"spammy\" comments by default. The system is built using a Facebook-developed deep learning algorithm known as DeepText (first implemented on the social network to detect spam comments), which utilizes natural-language processing techniques, and can also filter by user-specified keywords.\nIn September 2017, the company announced that public users would be able to limit who can comment on their content, such as only their followers or people they follow. At the same time, it updated its automated comment filter to support additional languages. In July 2019, the service announced that it would introduce a system to proactively detect problematic comments and encourage the user to reconsider their comment, as well as allowing users the ability to \"restrict\" others' abilities to communicate with them, citing that younger users felt the existing block system was too much of an escalation.\nAn April 2022 study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that Instagram failed to act on 90% of abusive direct messages (DMs) sent to five high-profile women, despite the DMs being reported to moderators. The participants of the study included actress Amber Heard, journalist Bryony Gordon, television presenter Rachel Riley, activist Jamie Klingler and magazine founder Sharan Dhaliwal. Instagram disputed many of the study's conclusions.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nOn August 9, 2012, English musician Ellie Goulding released a new music video for her song \"Anything Could Happen\". The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted.\n\n\n=== Security ===\nIn August 2017, reports surfaced that a bug in Instagram's developer tools had allowed \"one or more individuals\" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, Selena Gomez. The company said in a statement that it had \"fixed the bug swiftly\" and was running an investigation. However, the following month, more details emerged, with a group of hackers selling contact information online, with the affected number of accounts in the \"millions\" rather than the previously assumed limitation on verified accounts. Hours after the hack, a searchable database was posted online, charging $10 per search. The Daily Beast was provided with a sample of the affected accounts and could confirm that, while many of the email addresses could be found with a Google search in public sources, some did not return relevant Google search results and thus were from private sources. The Verge wrote that cybersecurity firm RepKnight had found contact information for multiple actors, musicians, and athletes, and singer Selena Gomez's account was used by the hackers to post naked photos of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. The company admitted that \"we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted\", but believed that \"it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts\", though TechCrunch stated in its report that six million accounts were affected by the hack, and that \"Instagram services more than 700 million accounts; six million is not a small number\".\nIn 2019, Apple pulled an app which let users stalk people on Instagram by scraping accounts and collecting data. Iran has DPI blocking for Instagram.\nIn September 2024, Meta paid out a $101 million fine for storing up to 600 million passwords of Instagram and Facebook users in plain text. The practice was initially discovered in 2019, though reports indicate passwords were stored in plain text since 2012.\n\n\n=== Content ownership ===\nOn December 17, 2012, Instagram announced a change to its Terms of Service policy, adding the following sentence:\n\nTo help us deliver interesting paid or sponsored content or promotions, you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.\nThere was no option for users to opt out of the changed Terms of Service without deleting their accounts before the new policy went into effect on January 16, 2013. The move garnered severe criticism from users, prompting Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom to write a blog post one day later, announcing that they would \"remove\" the offending language from the policy. Citing misinterpretations about its intention to \"communicate that we'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram\", Systrom also stated that it was \"our mistake that this language is confusing\" and that \"it is not our intention to sell your photos\". Furthermore, he wrote that they would work on \"updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear\".\nThe policy change and its backlash caused competing photo services to use the opportunity to \"try to lure users away\" by promoting their privacy-friendly services, and some services experienced substantial gains in momentum and user growth following the news. On December 20, Instagram announced that the advertising section of the policy would be reverted to its original October 2010 version. The Verge wrote about that policy as well, however, noting that the original policy gives the company right to \"place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content\", meaning that \"Instagram has always had the right to use your photos in ads, almost any way it wants. We could have had the exact same freakout last week, or a year ago, or the day Instagram launched\".\nThe policy update also introduced an arbitration clause, which remained even after the language pertaining to advertising and user content had been modified.\n\n\n=== Facebook acquisition as a violation of U.S. antitrust law ===\nColumbia Law School professor Tim Wu has given public talks claiming that Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram was a felony. On February 26, 2019, the New York Post released an article stating that the FTC had discovered a memo authored by a senior Facebook official, revealing that the purpose behind the acquisition of Instagram was to remove a potential rival. Wu explains this is a violation of US antitrust law (see monopoly). Wu stated that this document was an email directly from Mark Zuckerberg, whereas the Post article had stated that their source had declined to say whether the high-ranking executive was the CEO.\n\n\n=== Algorithmic advertisement with a rape threat ===\nIn 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for The Guardian, posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her. The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister. An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told The Guardian that \"We are sorry this happened – it's not the experience we want someone to have. This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram. Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends.\" As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes.\n\n\n=== Human exploitation ===\nIn May 2021, The Washington Post published a report detailing a \"black market\" of unlicensed employment agents luring migrant workers from Africa and Asia into indentured servitude as maids in Persian Gulf countries and using Instagram posts containing their personal information (including in some cases, passport numbers) to market them. Instagram deleted 200 accounts that had been reported by the Post, and a spokesperson stated that Instagram took this activity \"extremely seriously\", disabled 200 accounts found by the Post to be engaging in these activities, and was continuing to work on systems to automatically detect and disable accounts engaging in human exploitation.\n\n\n=== July 2022 updates ===\nIn July 2022, Instagram announced a set of updates which immediately received widespread backlash from its userbase. The changes included a feed more focused on Instagram's content algorithms, full-screen photo and video posts, and changing the format of all of its videos to Reels. The primary criticisms for these updates was that Instagram was more like TikTok than photo sharing. The backlash originated from an Instagram post and Change.org petition created by photographer Tati Bruening (under the username @illumitati) on July 23, 2022, featuring the statement \"Make Instagram Instagram again. (stop trying to be TikTok; i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.\". The post and petition gained mainstream attention after influencers Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted the Instagram post; subsequently, the original post gained over 2 million likes on Instagram and over 275,000 signatures on Change.org. Instagram walked back the update on July 28, with Meta saying \"We recognize that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and while we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.\" Despite repeated attempts by Meta to shape Instagram to appear and operate more like TikTok, user engagement continued to lag far behind its rival as of 2022.\n\n\n=== Propaganda usage ===\nInstagram has been used for propaganda purposes by a variety of different countries for different reasons. The reasons can be for domestic promotion of certain goals or foreign policy objectives. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Instagram was used for propaganda purposes.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\nThe most-liked photo on Instagram is a carousel of photos from footballer Lionel Messi celebrating winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup, The post has over 76 million likes.\nIn 2022, Instagram was the second most downloaded mobile app of the year.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nSocial Animals (documentary film): A 2018 documentary film about three teenagers growing up on Instagram\nInstagram model: a term for models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on Instagram\nInstapoetry is a style of poetry which formed by sharing images of short poems by poets on Instagram.\nInstagram Pier: a cargo working area in Hong Kong that gained its nickname due to its popularity on Instagram\n\n\n== System ==\nInstagram is written in Python.

        "title": "Mahavatar Narsimha",
        "content": "Mahavatar Narsimha is a 2024 Indian animated epic devotional action film directed by Ashwin Kumar in his directorial debut, written by Jayapurna Das, produced by Kleem Productions, and presented by Hombale Films. The film is the first installment in the planned animated seven-part Mahavatar Cinematic Universe, based on the ten avatars of Lord Vishnu. \nThe film chronicles the divine incarnations of Lord Vishnu, they are Varaha and Narasimha. Varaha, a mighty boar, rescues Bhudevi (Mother Earth) from the Asura (demon) Hiranyaksha. After his victory, the story shifts to Hiranyakashipu, Hiranyaksha’s brother, who gains a boon, declares himself god, and oppresses Vishnu’s followers. Prahlad, his son and devoted follower of Vishnu, remains faithful despite his father’s threats. To save Prahlad and defeat evil, Vishnu appears as Narsimha, a half-man, half-lion form, who kills Hiranyakashipu while honoring the conditions of the demon’s boon from Brahma. Blending two major episodes from the Dashavatara, Mahavatar Narsimha explores themes of divine justice, unshakable faith, and the eternal promise of protection to the righteous.\nThe soundtrack and background score were composed by Sam C. S., with editing handled by Ajay Varma and Ashwin Kumar himself.\nMahavatar Narsimha was screened on 25 November 2024 at the International Film Festival of India and was theatrically released on 25 July 2025 in 2D and 3D formats. It is the fourth highest-grossing Indian film of 2025, It received positive reviews from critics and emerged as the highest-grossing Indian animated film, surpassing Kochadaiiyaan (2014).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSage Kashyapa is engaged in evening prayers when one of his wives, Diti, approaches him for children. Kashyapa requests Diti to be patient as this is an inauspicious time for union, but she remains adamant. Kashyapa relents out of marital duty, but declares that since Diti approached him during an inauspicious hour, she shall give birth to two Daityas who shall provoke enmity with Vishnu and terrorize his devotees. Kashyapa also declares that the two Daityas shall be slain by Vishnu for their crimes. Diti gives birth to two sons, Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha, who are instructed in tamasic knowledge and mystical powers under the guidance of Shukracharya. As they grow in power, the brothers wage war on the universe.\nThe younger brother, Hiranyaksha, kidnaps Bhudevi (Mother Earth) and imprisons her in the Garbodhak ocean to provoke Vishnu, throwing the world into chaos. In response, Bhagwan Vishnu, protector of the universe, takes the form of Varaha—a colossal, divine boar—and engages in a fierce battle across the cosmic waters. Varaha rescues Bhudevi and kills Hiranyaksha in the subsequent duel.\nDevastated by the death of his beloved brother and consumed by vengeance, Hiranyakashipu retreats into the Himalayas for deep tapasya (penance). His austerities shake the cosmos and ultimately earn him a boon from Brahma: he cannot be slain by any creation of Brahma, be it a god, man or beast, day or night, indoors or outdoors, on land or in the sky, by weapon or by hand. Believing himself now invincible, Hiranyakashipu declares war on the Devas, conquers their realms, and proclaims himself “God of the Universe.”\nBut the divine has its own mysterious ways. During Hiranyakashipu's absence, Indra abducts his pregnant wife, Kayadhu. However, Sage Narada intervenes in the role of a Guru (spiritual guide) and advises Indra to uphold dharma (righteous conduct), even in times of adversity. Narada then offers shelter to Kayadhu in his ashram and instructs her in the path of devotion to Vishnu, teachings which are absorbed by her unborn child Prahlad while still in the womb.\nTo Hiranyakashipu’s dismay, his own son Prahlad, a gentle and wise-hearted child refuses to acknowledge him as God. Instead, the boy remains deeply devoted to Lord Vishnu, chanting his name with unwavering faith. Prahlad had imbibed Narada's teachings before he was born. Hiranyakshipu urges the sons of Shukracharya to teach the boy better, but they fail to do so. Infuriated, the demon king subjects Prahlad to unimaginable torments: mad elephants, having him thrown from a cliff and more. But Prahlad emerges unharmed each time, protected by the very force his father seeks to destroy. Hiranyakashipu orders his sister Holika, who has power on fire, to take Prahlad with her as he is burned to the stake. However, Holika's boon backfired and is burnt to death while Prahlad remains unscathed. Hiranyakashipu has him thrown into the sea, only for Varuna to save Prahlad. On Varuna's suggestion, Prahlad calls out to Lord Vishnu, who finally appears before the boy. Vishnu expresses his eagerness to meet his devotee and reassures Prahlad that he considers himself a servant (dāsa) of his true devotees. Pleased with Prahlad's devotion, Vishnu grants him the boon that the boy shall perceive him in every animate and inanimate object in the universe.\nUpon returning home, Prahlad is mocked by his father, who sarcastically asks if Vishnu is present within a nearby pillar. Prahlad affirms that he is. Enraged, Hiranyakashipu strikes the pillar, from which emerges Lord Narasimha a terrifying incarnation of Vishnu with the body of a man and the head of a lion. A massive battle ensues, during which Narasimha slaughters many Asuras. Narasimha ultimately defeats Hiranyakashipu and kills him through evisceration in a manner that circumvents Brahma’s boon: at twilight (neither day nor night), on a threshold (neither indoors nor outdoors), on his lap (neither earth nor sky), using his claws (neither weapon nor bare hands), and as Narasimha (neither man, god, beast, nor a creation of Brahma).\nFollowing Hiranyakashipu’s death, the gods request Prahlad to pacify Narasimha's rage. Moved by Prahlad’s devotion, Narasimha calms and blesses him, stating that his father Hiranyakashipu's sins have been absolved through divine contact. Narada lightheartedly reminds Indra that Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu are the first of three incarnations of Jaya and Vijaya in Satya Yuga, the cursed dvarapalakas (gatekeepers) of Vaikuntha, who are destined to be reborn as enemies of Vishnu across three yugas. Surrounding devotees, along with the gods and demigods gather in reverence to perform the \"Narasimha Aarti\", a devotional hymn praising Lord Narasimha for his fierce protection and boundless grace.\n\n\n== Voice cast ==\n\n\n=== Hindi version ===\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe project emerged from Kleem Productions to create a 3D animated epic rooted in Hindu history. Announced in mid‑2024, the film is described by director Ashwin Kumar as a \"labor of love rooted in our collective history,\" drawing inspiration from the Vishnu Purana, Narasimha Purana, and Shrimad Bhagavata Purana. Hombale Films only presents the film.\nThe production marked a strategic push to elevate Indian animation. Kumar emphasized their goal to challenge the notion that animation is only for children, asserting that the film proves \"Indian VFX and animation can be of world‑class quality.\" The animation process spanned roughly four and a half years, with meticulous attention to photorealism.\n\n\n=== Incorporation of historical sites and Hindu scriptures ===\nIn an interview published on the official channel of Hombale Films, director Ashwin Kumar mentioned his personal visit to Raktkund at Ahobila Matha, and explained how his team have incorporated various historical and scriptural references—most notably archaeological sites such as the Ahobila Nava Narasimha Swamy temples, restored burnt shrine of Yog-Narasimha in Hampi, probable ruins of Prahladpuri Temple, Multan etc. and sacred texts like the Vishnu Purana, Narasimha Purana, Varaha Purana, Padma Purana and Shrimad Bhagavata Purana—to shape the narrative similar to trend shown in the film Ram Setu. \n\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe film score and soundtrack album of the film are composed by Sam C.

While not without its flaws, it more than compensates with its heart, message, and the sheer sincerity of its storytelling\". Anurag Singh Bohra of India Today rated the film 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \"Overall, the film makes for a compelling watch for its emotional relatability and stunning depiction of Narsimha in the goosebump-inducing climax\".

Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote, \"The climax is world-class, even if ultra-violent, with body parts and blood flowing generously. Trigger warning for small kids.

        "content": "Frank Caprio (November 24, 1936 – August 20, 2025) was an American judge and politician who served as the chief judge of the municipal court of Providence, Rhode Island, and chairman of the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education. His judicial work was televised on the program Caught in Providence. He also made appearances in the series Parking Wars, adjudicating several cases of traffic violations. The Caught in Providence YouTube channel has 2.92 million subscribers. In 2017, his videos in the courtroom went viral, with more than 15 million views. By 2022, views of Caught in Providence neared 500 million. He became well known for his empathy and light humor in court. A Democrat, Caprio served on the Providence City Council in the 1960s, and unsuccessfully ran for both Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCaprio was born in the Italian-American neighborhood of Federal Hill, Providence, the second of three sons of Antonio Caprio, an immigrant from Teano, Italy, and Filomena Caprio, a Providence native whose family had immigrated from Naples, Italy. \nCaprio's father, Antonio \"Tup\" Caprio, a fruit peddler and milkman, was a major influence in his life, firmly teaching his children to study and be compassionate to the poor, and continuing to be a \"powerful presence\" during his son's work as a judge. In his later years, Tup Caprio worked as a psychologist, being a published author on social psychology.\nCaprio attended Providence public schools while working as a dishwasher and shoe-shiner. He graduated from Central High School, where he won the state title in wrestling in 1953. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1958 from Providence College, a Catholic university founded by the Dominican Order.

While on the council, Caprio chaired the Committee on Urban Redevelopment, Renewal and Planning. His committee investigated allegations that the city's anti-poverty agency, Progress for Providence, was improperly allocating its funds.\nCaprio sought the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island in 1968.

He chaired the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, which controls major decisions for the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and Community College of Rhode Island.\nDuring the 1976 Democratic presidential primaries, Caprio served as the Rhode Island state chairman for the campaign California Governor Jerry Brown. Brown had declared his candidacy too late to compete in Rhode Island's primary, but his campaign was still seeking to secure the support of uncommitted delegates from the state.\n\n\n== Judge of the Providence Municipal Court ==\nFrom 1985 to 2023, Caprio served as a Providence Municipal Court Judge. Caprio released his book Compassion in the Court on February 4, 2025.\n\n\n=== Caught in Providence ===\nParts of the proceedings over which he presided, featuring low-level citations, ran for more than two decades on local television.

        "title": "Liam Neeson",
        "content": "William John Neeson  (born 7 June 1952) is an actor from Northern Ireland. He has received several accolades, including nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and two Tony Awards. In 2020, he was placed seventh on The Irish Times' list of Ireland's 50 Greatest Film Actors. Neeson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2000.\nNeeson made his film debut in 1978 with  Pilgrim's Progress followed by early roles in Excalibur (1981), The Bounty (1984), The Mission (1986), The Dead Pool (1988), and Husbands and Wives (1992). He rose to prominence portraying Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's Holocaust drama Schindler's List (1993) for which he earned an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. He played leading man roles in drama films such as Nell (1994), Rob Roy (1995), Michael Collins (1996), and Les Misérables (1998). He took blockbuster roles portraying Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), Ra's al Ghul in Batman Begins (2005), and Aslan in  The Chronicles of Narnia trilogy (2005–2010).\nNeeson acted in films such as the historical drama Gangs of New York (2002), the romantic comedy Love Actually (2003), the biographical drama Kinsey (2004), the erotic thriller Chloe (2009), the religious drama Silence (2016), the fantasy film A Monster Calls (2016), the crime thriller Widows (2018), the anthology film The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018), and the romantic drama Ordinary Love (2019). Beginning in 2009, Neeson cemented himself as an action star with the action thriller series Taken (2008–2014), The A-Team (2010), The Grey (2011), Wrath of the Titans (2012), A Walk Among the Tombstones (2014), and Cold Pursuit (2019). He is known for his collaborations in the genre with the director Jaume Collet-Serra and starred in four of his films: Unknown (2011), Non-Stop (2014), Run All Night (2015), and The Commuter (2018). \nOn stage, Neeson joined the Lyric Players' Theatre in Belfast in 1976 for two years. On Broadway he earned two Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nominations for his performances as Matt Burke in the revival of Eugene O'Neill's Anna Christie (1992) and John Proctor in the Arthur Miller revival of The Crucible (2002). He portrayed Oscar Wilde in David Hare's The Judas Kiss (1998).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nNeeson was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, the son of primary school caretaker Bernard \"Barney\" Neeson and cook Katherine \"Kitty\" Neeson (née Brown). His mother was born and raised in Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. Brought up Catholic, he was named Liam after a local priest. He has three sisters, Elizabeth, Bernadette, and Rosaleen. He attended St Patrick's College, Ballymena, from 1963 to 1967, and later recalled that his love of drama began there.\nHe said that growing up as a Catholic in a predominantly Protestant town made him cautious, and once said he felt like a \"second-class citizen\" there, but has also said he was never made to feel \"inferior or even different\" at the town's predominantly Protestant technical college. \"It would be colourful to imagine I had a rebellious, uproarious Irish background,\" he has said, \"but the facts were much greyer. Irish, yes. But all that nationalistic stuff, crying into your Guinness and singing rebel songs—that was never my scene.\" He has described himself as \"out of touch\" with the politics and history of Northern Ireland until becoming aware of protests by fellow students after Bloody Sunday, a massacre in Derry in 1972 during the Troubles, which encouraged him to learn more local history. In a 2009 interview, he said, \"I never stop thinking about [the Troubles]. I've known guys and girls who have been perpetrators of violence and victims. Protestants and Catholics. It's part of my DNA.\"\nAt age nine, Neeson began boxing lessons at the All Saints Youth Club, and went on to win a number of regional titles before quitting at 17. He acted in school productions during his teens. His interest in acting and decision to become an actor were also influenced by Ian Paisley, founder of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), into whose Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster he sneaked. He said, \"[Paisley] had a magnificent presence and it was incredible to watch him just Bible-thumping away... it was acting, but it was also great acting and stirring too.\" In 1971, he joined a physics and computer science course at Queen's University Belfast before leaving to work for the Guinness Brewery. At Queen's, he discovered a talent for football and was spotted by Seán Thomas at Bohemian FC. There was a club trial in Dublin and Neeson played one game as a substitute against Shamrock Rovers FC, but was not offered a contract.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1976–1993: Rise to prominence ===\nAfter leaving university, Neeson returned to Ballymena, where he worked in a variety of casual jobs, such as a forklift operator at Guinness and a lorry driver. He also attended teacher training college for two years in Newcastle upon Tyne before again returning to his hometown. In 1976, he joined the Lyric Players Theatre in Belfast, where he performed for two years. He got his first film experience in 1977, playing Jesus Christ and The Evangelist in the religious film Pilgrim's Progress (1978). He moved to Dublin in 1978, when he was offered a part in Ron Hutchinson's Says I, Says He, a drama about The Troubles, at the Project Arts Centre. He acted in several other Project productions and joined the Abbey Theatre (the National Theatre of Ireland). In 1980, he performed with Stephen Rea, Ray McAnally and Mick Lally, playing Doalty in Brian Friel's play Translations, the first production of Friel's and Rea's Field Day Theatre Company, first presented in the Guildhall in Derry on 23 September 1980.\nIn 1980, filmmaker John Boorman saw him on stage as Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men and offered him the role of Sir Gawain in the Arthurian film Excalibur. After the role, Neeson moved to London, where he continued working on stage and in small-budget films and television. He lived with actress Helen Mirren, whom he met working on Excalibur. Between 1982 and 1987, he starred in five films, most notably with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins in 1984's The Bounty, and Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons in 1986's The Mission. Neeson guest-starred in the third season of the television series Miami Vice in 1986, and moved to Hollywood the next year to take higher-profile roles. He starred with Cher and Dennis Quaid in Suspect, which brought him critical acclaim. In 1988, he appeared with Clint Eastwood in the fifth Dirty Harry film, The Dead Pool, as Peter Swan, a horror film director. In 1990, he had a starring role in Sam Raimi's Darkman. Although the film was successful, Neeson's subsequent years did not bring him the same recognition. He also starred in the eponymous role for the film Ethan Frome (1993).\n\n\n=== 1993–2000: Breakthrough and acclaim ===\nSteven Spielberg offered Neeson the role of Oskar Schindler in his holocaust film Schindler's List, after seeing him in Anna Christie on Broadway. Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson and Warren Beatty had all expressed interest in the part. Beatty even auditioned, but Neeson was cast in December 1992. He had read Keneally's book and concluded that his character \"enjoyed fookin' [sic] with the Nazis. In Keneally's book, it says he was regarded as a kind of a buffoon by them... if the Nazis were New Yorkers, he was from Arkansas. They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\" His critically acclaimed performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor Oscar and helped the film earn Best Picture of 1993. He also received BAFTA and Golden Globes nominations for the performance. \nIn 1993, Neeson made his Broadway debut playing Mat Burke in the revival of the Eugene O'Neill play Anna Christie, starring opposite his Ellis Island co-star and future wife Natasha Richardson. For his performance, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. The following year, they also worked together in Nell (1994), starring Jodie Foster. He then took leading roles in several period piece drama films, including playing the lead role of Rob Roy MacGregor in the historical drama  Rob Roy (1995) opposite Jessica Lange, Brian Cox, and Tim Roth. Critic Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times praised his ability to be a leading man writing, \"Neeson, tall and grand, makes an effortless hero as Rob Roy\". \nThe following year, he acted in Neil Jordan's historical drama Michael Collins (1996), alongside Julia Roberts and Alan Rickman. Neeson portrayed the title role as the Irish revolutionary leading the fight for Irish independence. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where it received the Golden Lion with Neeson earning the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. He later earned nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. Todd McCarthy of Variety praised his performance writing, \"Neeson is a compulsive dynamo as Collins, with the actor seizing his part with a passion and boldness utterly in keeping with the character’s approach to life and his cause\".\nNeeson portrayed Jean Valjean in the 1998 adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, directed by Bille August. He starred alongside Uma Thurman, Geoffrey Rush, and Claire Danes. Writing of Neeson's performance, Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \"[He] plays the role with the sure physical authority and profound decency that are fundamental to Valjean's character\" adding, \"With a first-rate cast and a venerable storytelling style, it fluently condenses Victor Hugo's epic novel and retrieves some of its suspenseful momentum.\" That same year, he returned to the stage in the David Hare play The Judas Kiss (1998), portraying Oscar Wilde which ran at both the Almeida Theatre in the West End and the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway. He acted alongside Tom Hollander and Peter Capaldi. In 1999, he acted in the supernatural horror film The Haunting (1999) opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n\n\n=== 1999–2007: Blockbuster roles ===\n\nIn 1999, Neeson starred as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Director George Lucas cast Neeson because he considered him a \"master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands.\" As the first Star Wars film to be released in 16 years, it was surrounded by media anticipation. Neeson's connection to Star Wars started in the Crown Bar, Belfast. He told Ricki Lake, \"I probably wouldn't have taken the role if it wasn't for the advice of Peter King in the Crown during a Lyric reunion.\" Despite mixed reviews from critics and fans, the film was a box office success.\nNeeson's performance as Qui-Gon received positive reviews and a Saturn Award nomination. A stock recording of his voice from The Phantom Menace can be heard during a scene in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002). Neeson was later reported to be appearing in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005), but ultimately did not. In the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–20), he voiced Qui-Gon in two episodes of the third season and one episode of the sixth season, and he also made a voice cameo as Qui-Gon in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Neeson appeared as Qui-Gon in the final episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022), appearing as a force ghost to Obi-Wan, in an uncredited cameo, marking his first live-action portrayal of Qui-Gon since The Phantom Menace. He later voiced Qui-Gon again for an episode of the animated Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (2022).\nNeeson narrated the 2001 documentaries Journey into Amazing Caves, a short film about two scientists who travel around the world to search for material for potential cures; and The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Adventure. The latter won awards at a number of film festivals, including Best Documentary from both the Chicago Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review. Neeson returned to Broadway in the revival of the Arthur Miller play The Crucible acting opposite Laura Linney. For his performance as John Proctor, he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. Charles Isherwood of Variety praised Neeson writing, \"In his thoughtful performance as Proctor, the effortlessly charismatic Neeson subtly delineates a man’s moral evolution as Proctor moves from casual scorn for the proceedings to outrage to soul-stricken despair\" adding, \"Perhaps the finest aspect of Neeson’s performance is its admirable restraint\". That same year Neeson acted with Harrison Ford in Kathryn Bigelow's 2002 submarine thriller K-19: The Widowmaker as Captain Mikhail Polenin. He was also in the cast of Martin Scorsese's historical drama Gangs of New York with Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cameron Diaz.\nIn 2003, he played a recently widowed writer in Richard Curtis's romantic comedy ensemble Love Actually (2003), acting alongside Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Laura Linney. The film was a commercial success and has since become a cult classic and holiday favorite. The following year, he portrayed Alfred Kinsey in the biographical drama Kinsey reuniting with Laura Linney, Peter Sarsgaard, and John Lithgow. Neeson received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, losing to Leonardo DiCaprio for The Aviator (2004). That year, Neeson hosted an episode of the NBC sketch show Saturday Night Live. He starred as a redneck trucker, Marlon Weaver, in an \"Appalachian Emergency Room\" sketch and as a hippie in a one-off sketch about two stoners (the other played by Amy Poehler) who attempt to borrow a police dog to find their lost stash of marijuana. Despite vowing not to play any Irish stereotypes, Neeson did play an Irish man named Lorcan McArdle in the home makeover show parody \"You Call This A House, Do Ya?\"\n\nIn 2005, Neeson took multiple roles in mainstream blockbuster films. He portrayed Godfrey of Ibelin in Ridley Scott's epic adventure Kingdom of Heaven; Ra's al Ghul, one of the main villains in Christopher Nolan's action film Batman Begins; and Father Bernard in Neil Jordan's adaptation of Patrick McCabe's novel Breakfast on Pluto. That same year, he replaced Brian Cox, playing Aslan the Lion in the fantasy adventure film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005), an adaptation of the C. S. Lewis book of the same name. In The Simpsons episode, \"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star\" (2005), he voiced the kindly priest who (briefly) converts Bart and Homer to Catholicism.\nIn 2007, he starred in the American Civil War epic Seraphim Falls. Neeson voiced the main character's father, James, in the video game Fallout 3. Executive producer Todd Howard said, \"This role was written with Liam in mind, and provides the dramatic tone for the entire game\". Fallout 3, the third game in the Fallout series, was extremely well received by critics and shipped 4.7 million copies by the end of 2008, the year it was released. In the director's commentary of the 2007 Transformers DVD, Michael Bay said he had told the animators to seek inspiration from Neeson in creating Optimus Prime's body language. Neeson appeared as Alistair Little in the BBC Northern Ireland/Big Fish Films television drama, Five Minutes of Heaven, which tells the true story of a young Protestant man convicted of murdering a Catholic boy during The Troubles.\n\n\n=== 2008–present: Action stardom ===\n\nIn 2008, Neeson starred in the action film Taken, a French-produced film also starring Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace, based on a script by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by Pierre Morel. Neeson plays a retired CIA operative from the elite Special Activities Division who sets about tracking down his teenage daughter after she is kidnapped. Taken was a worldwide box-office hit, grossing $223.9 million worldwide, making almost $200 million more than its production budget. Neeson has said in interviews that he believed that Taken had put some people off the idea of actually travelling to Europe. Taken brought Neeson back into the centre of the public eye and resulted in his being cast in many more big-budget Hollywood movies. That year, he also narrated the documentary Black Holes: The Other Side of Infinity and again lent his voice to Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008). He also provided a voice for Hayao Miyazaki's anime film Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, which received an August 2009 release.\nIn 2010, Neeson played Zeus in the remake of the 1981 film, Clash of the Titans. The film was a huge box-office hit, grossing $475 million worldwide. Neeson also starred in Atom Egoyan's erotic thriller, Chloe, theatrically released by Sony Pictures Classics on 26 March 2010. Chloe had enjoyed commercial success and became the Canadian director's biggest money maker ever. Later the same year, he played John \"Hannibal\" Smith in the spin-off movie from the television series The A-Team. Neeson voiced Aslan once more in the 2010 sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. That same year, he made a guest-star appearance on the Showtime series The Big C with Laura Linney. In 2011, Neeson starred in the action-thriller Unknown, a German-British-American co-production of a French book filmed in Berlin in early 2010, and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.  This film led to a collaboration between Neeson and Collet-Serra (as director and/or producer) on a series of similar action films including Non-Stop (2014), Run All Night (2015), The Commuter (2018) and Retribution (2023). Neeson reunited with Steven Spielberg with plans to star as Abraham Lincoln in the 2012 film Lincoln, based on the book Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin. In preparation for the role, Neeson visited the District of Columbia and Springfield, Illinois, where Lincoln lived before being elected, and read Lincoln's personal letters. Neeson eventually declined the role, claiming he was \"past his sell date\" and had grown too old for the role and was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis (who won his third Academy Award for Best Actor for playing Lincoln).\n\nIn 2011, he played himself in BBC2's series Life's Too Short starring Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant and Warwick Davis. In late 2011, Neeson was cast to play the lead character, a journalist, in a new album recording and arena production of Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds. He replaced Richard Burton, who had posthumously appeared in the arena production through CGI animation. Neeson did not physically appear on the stage, instead playing the role through the use of 3D holography. In 2012, Neeson starred in Joe Carnahan's The Grey. The film received mostly positive reviews and Neeson's performance received critical acclaim. He also starred in Taken 2 (2012), a successful sequel to his 2008 blockbuster. That year, he reprised the role of Ra's al Ghul in a cameo appearance in The Dark Knight Rises (2012), the final film in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy. Dialogue from his role as Ra's al Ghul in Batman Begins was featured in the first trailer for the film.\nNeeson had a supporting role as the henchman Bad Cop/Good Cop in the animated film The Lego Movie (2014), which was a critical and commercial success. Neeson later played Bill Marks in the 2014 action film Non-Stop. The film was released on 28 February 2014. He also appeared, uncredited, as God in the BBC2 series Rev. Neeson starred in the 2014 film A Walk Among the Tombstones, an adaption of the best-selling novel of the same name, in which he plays former cop Matthew Scudder, a detective hired to hunt the killers of a drug dealer's wife. That same year, he starred with Seth MacFarlane as an outlaw in the western comedy film A Million Ways to Die in the West. During Super Bowl XLIX, Supercell did a Clash of Clans commercial with Neeson playing the game as \"AngryNeeson52\" and vowing revenge on his opponent \"BigBuffetBoy85\" while waiting for his scone at a bakery. The appearance was a parody of his role in Taken. Following the success of the Taken films, Neeson has become increasingly known as a star of action thriller films.  Besides The A-Team, Unknown, The Grey, Non-Stop, A Walk Among the Tombstones, Run All Night, The Commuter and Retribution, other recent action films starring Neeson have included Cold Pursuit (2019), Honest Thief (2020), The Marksman (2021), The Ice Road (2021), Blacklight (2022), Memory (2022), In the Land of Saints and Sinners (2023) and Absolution (2024). Neeson has indicated a desire to retire from the action genre though the films have taken his acting career in a new direction.\nIn 2016, Neeson narrated the RTÉ One three-part documentary on the Easter Rising, 1916. Also in 2016, Neeson reunited with director Martin Scorsese on the drama Silence, starring alongside Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver. That same year, he did the voice and motion capture for the Monster in the Spanish film A Monster Calls. In 2018, he acted in the Coen brothers' western anthology film The Ballad of Buster Scruggs and the Steve McQueen crime thriller Widows, acting opposite Viola Davis. He portrayed Mark Felt in Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House (2017), directed by Peter Landesman and Philip Marlowe in Marlowe (2022), directed by Neil Jordan. He acted in the romantic drama Ordinary Love (2019) with Lesley Manville and the biographical drama Wildcat starring Maya Hawke. On television, he played Chief Constable Byers\t in Derry Girls (2022), and portrayed a fictional version of himself in Atlanta (2022).\n\n\n== Activism ==\nNeeson opposes what he sees as the unrestricted right to own firearms in the U.S. and has made calls for gun control. In January 2015, he repeated his views, calling U.S. gun laws a \"disgrace\" in an interview with Emirati newspaper Gulf News when replying to a question about the Charlie Hebdo shootings earlier that month. In response, American gun manufacturer Para USA, which provided the prop weapons used by Neeson in the Taken film series, stated: \"We will no longer provide firearms for use in films starring Liam Neeson and ask that our friends and partners in Hollywood refrain from associating our brand and products with his projects.\"\nIn 2014, Neeson protested against the anti-carriage horse campaign of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said he would outlaw horse-drawn carriages in Central Park once he took office. He wrote an opinion page published in The New York Times citing the carriage trade as a safe one for employees, horses, and tourists, and noted it was a livelihood for many immigrants.\nNeeson narrated a video for Amnesty International in favour of the legalisation of abortion in Ireland, which some conservative and pro-life commentators claimed was \"anti-Catholic\".\nNeeson was opposed to Brexit, stating in 2016 that it would be truly \"a shame to sacrifice all the progress that has been made by the peace process regarding border controls\".\nIn September 2017, Neeson compared the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump to the Watergate scandal of Richard Nixon: \"Democracy works and no man—and certainly not the president—is above the law. He has to be accountable.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Marriage and relationships ===\nNeeson lived with actress Helen Mirren during the early 1980s. They met while working on Excalibur (1981). Interviewed by James Lipton for Inside the Actors Studio, Neeson said Mirren was instrumental in him getting an agent. \nHe dated Barbra Streisand for about nine months between 1991 and 1992.\nNeeson then met actress Natasha Richardson while performing in a revival of the play Anna Christie on Broadway in 1993. They were married on 3 July 1994 and had two sons together, Micheál (born 1995) and Daniel (born 1996). In October 1998, they won £50,000 ($85,370) in libel damages after the Daily Mirror wrongly claimed that their marriage was suffering. They donated the money to victims of the August 1998 Omagh bombing. In August 2004, they purchased an estate in Millbrook, New York. On 18 March 2009, Richardson died when she suffered a traumatic brain injury in a skiing accident at the Mont Tremblant Resort, northwest of Montreal. Neeson donated her organs following her death.\nAfter Richardson's death, Neeson dated Freya St. Johnston for two years. He has not dated again since the split, stating in 2024 that he was \"past all of that\".\n\n\n=== Heritage and beliefs ===\nNeeson holds Irish and American citizenship, having been naturalised as an American citizen in 2009. He primarily identifies as Irish. After taking up American citizenship, he was adamant he was not turning his back on his Irish roots. In 2009, nearly four decades after he was an undergraduate in physics and computer science at Queen's University, Belfast, the university awarded him an honorary doctorate which was presented to him in New York by Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Gregson. In March 2011, he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF. He is a patron of Belfast-based charity and film festival CineMagic, which helps young people get involved in the movie industry.\nA heavy smoker earlier in his career, Neeson quit smoking in 2003 while working on Love Actually. When he took the role of Hannibal for the 2010 film adaptation of The A-Team, he had reservations about smoking cigars (a signature trait of the character), but agreed to do it for the film.\nIn June 2012, Neeson's publicist denied reports that Neeson was converting to Islam. Neeson has expressed an affection for the adhan, the Islamic call to prayer, that he grew accustomed to while filming Taken 2 in Istanbul: \"By the third week, it was like I couldn't live without it. It really became hypnotic and very moving for me in a very special way. Very beautiful.\" He also expressed admiration for the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola.\nNeeson's mother, Kitty, died in June 2020. He was unable to return to his hometown for her funeral due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n=== Social views ===\nNeeson is a long-term supporter of the need for more integrated education in Northern Ireland; that is, educating Catholics and Protestants together. In 2017, he said, \"As Northern Ireland moves forward from division, who do we look to for a future we can share? Our children - so why do we continue to educate them apart? Different religions, different backgrounds, different schools. There is another way. Protestants and Catholics, other beliefs and none, learning and working together every day.\" He has praised schools where parents have voted to transform segregated schools into integrated schools, and fronted television adverts to encourage more parents to integrate their children's schools.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nNeeson was criticised for his comments on Ireland's Late Late Show in January 2018, during which he described the MeToo movement as a \"witch hunt\" and cited Garrison Keillor's dismissal from Minnesota Public Radio as an example.\nIn February 2019, Neeson gained public and media controversy after a press junket interview he conducted with The Independent while promoting Cold Pursuit, a film about a father seeking revenge for his son's murder. He said that he generated his character's \"primal\" anger by recounting an experience he had 40 years ago, in which a female friend of his had been raped by a stranger. After learning the attacker was a black man, Neeson said that he spent a week going \"up and down areas with a cosh, hoping some 'black bastard' would come out of a pub and have a go\" so that he \"could kill him\". In the interview, he also said he was ashamed of the experience and that the things he did and said were \"horrible\". He said, \"It's awful [...] but I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, 'What the fuck are you doing?'\"\nIn an appearance on Good Morning America, Neeson elaborated on his comments while denying being a racist, stating that he asked for physical attributes of the rapist other than his race and that he would have done the same if the rapist was \"a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian\". He also said that he had purposely gone into \"black areas of the city\" but that he \"did seek help\" and counselling from his friends and a priest after coming to his senses. He said that the lesson of his experience was \"to open up [and] to talk about these things\", including toxic masculinity and the underlying \"racism and bigotry\" in both the U.S. and Northern Ireland. The controversy following his comments led to cancellation of the red carpet event for the premiere of Cold Pursuit. Neeson was publicly defended by Michelle Rodriguez, Whoopi Goldberg, John Barnes, Trevor Noah, and Ralph Fiennes. Donald Glover later convinced him to appear in his FX series Atlanta episode \"New Jazz\" as a fictionalised version of himself, to examine the controversy.\n\n\n== Acting credits and accolades ==\n\nIn 2000, Neeson was offered the \"Freedom of the Town of Ballymena\" by the Ballymena Borough Council, but because of objections made by members of the Democratic Unionist Party regarding his comments that he had felt like a \"second-class citizen\" growing up as a Catholic in the town, he declined the award, citing tensions. Following the controversy, Neeson wrote a letter to the council, stating; \"I will always remain very proud of my upbringing in, and association with, the town and my country of birth, which I will continue to promote at every opportunity. Indeed, I regard the enduring support over the years from all sections of the community in Ballymena as being more than sufficient recognition for any success which I may have achieved as an actor.\" Subsequently, on 28 January 2013, Neeson received the Freedom of the Borough from Ballymena Borough Council at a ceremony in the town.\nNeeson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in her 2000 New Year Honours. The American Ireland Fund honoured Neeson with their Performing Arts Award for the great distinction he has brought to Ireland at their 2008 Dinner Gala in New York City. In 2009, at a ceremony in New York, Neeson was awarded an honorary doctorate by Queen's University, Belfast. On 9 April 2016, he was honoured with the Outstanding Contribution to Cinema Award by the Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) at the Mansion House, Dublin, with Irish President Michael D. Higgins presenting the award. In 2017, Neeson was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 74 in the list of 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs Worldwide. In January 2018, he was awarded the Distinguished Service for the Irish Abroad Award by Irish President Michael D. Higgins, who described it as an award \"for Irish people abroad who are making a contribution to humanity\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Academy Award winners and nominees from Great Britain\nList of Academy Award winners and nominees from Ireland\nList of actors with Academy Award nominations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nLiam Neeson at IMDb\nLiam Neeson at the Internet Broadway Database \nLiam Neeson at the TCM Movie Database \nLiam Neeson at the BFI's Screenonline\nLiam Neeson on GQ's Actually Me",

        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu] ; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for, and captains, both Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr and the Portugal national team. Nicknamed CR7, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in history, and has won numerous individual accolades throughout his career, including five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, four European Golden Shoes, and was named five times the world's best player by FIFA. He has won 34 trophies in his career, including five UEFA Champions Leagues and the UEFA European Championship. He holds the records for most goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals (14) and assists (8) in the European Championship, and most international appearances (221) and international goals (138). He is the only player to have scored 100 goals with four different clubs. He has made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 900 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time. \nBorn in Funchal, Madeira, Ronaldo began his career with Sporting CP before signing with Manchester United in 2003. He became a star player at United, where he won three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup. His 2007–08 season earned him his first Ballon d'Or at age 23. In 2009, Ronaldo became the subject of the then-most expensive transfer in history when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €94 million (£80 million). At Madrid, he was at the forefront of the club's resurgence as a dominant European force, helping them win four Champions Leagues between 2014 and 2018, including the long-awaited La Décima. He also won two La Liga titles, including the record-breaking 2011–12 season in which Madrid reached 100 points, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. He won Ballon d'Ors in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times to Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. Following issues with the club hierarchy, Ronaldo signed for Juventus in 2018 in a transfer worth an initial €100 million, where he was pivotal in winning two Serie A titles. In 2021, he returned to United before joining Al-Nassr in 2023.\nRonaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned more than 200 caps, making him history's most-capped male player. He has played in eleven major tournaments. He scored his first international goal in Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final and subsequently made the team of the tournament. He assumed captaincy of the national team ahead of Euro 2008; and at Euro 2012, he was named in the team of the tournament. Ronaldo led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, being named in the team of the tournament for the third time. In the 2018 World Cup, he had his most prolific World Cup campaign with four goals. He received the Golden Boot as the top scorer of Euro 2020 before playing in his fifth World Cup at the 2022 World Cup. He has won two UEFA Nations Leagues, in 2019 and 2025.\n\nOne of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes on five occasions, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. Ronaldo was named in the UEFA Ultimate Team of the Year in 2015, the All-time UEFA Euro XI in 2016, and the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in 2020. In recognition of his record-breaking goalscoring success, he received special awards for Outstanding Career Achievement by FIFA in 2021 and Champions League All-Time Top Scorer by UEFA in 2024.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António. He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha. His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16. He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia \"Kátia\". He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system. By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. \nWith a troubled life as a student, and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \"disrespected\" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he had not become a professional football player.\nGrowing up, Ronaldo idolised the Brazilian footballers Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Nazário, and has described them as leaving \"a beautiful history in football\".\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Sporting CP ===\nAfter impressing in Sporting's youth teams, he was promoted to the main team by first-team manager László Bölöni. At age 17, on 14 August 2002, he played his first official match for the first team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan, and his Primeira Liga debut, took place a month later against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win. Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson said Ronaldo was \"one of the most exciting young players\" he had ever seen.\n\n\n=== Manchester United ===\n\n\n==== 2003–2007: Development and breakthrough ====\n\nOn 12 August 2003, less than a week after the friendly that impressed Ferguson, Manchester United signed Ronaldo for £12 million, an England record for a teenager. This also made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.\nAlthough he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\"\n\n \nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003. His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. On 15 May 2004, in a victory against Aston Villa, Ronaldo scored the opening goal and later received the first red card of his career. Ronaldo ended his first season in English football with a trophy, scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final. BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \"elaborate\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents, but teammate Gary Neville said he was \"not a show pony, but the real thing\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.\n\nAt the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. United denied the possibility of him leaving the club. Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season, it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title.\n\n\n==== 2007–2009: Collective and individual success and Ballon d'Or ====\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season, winning the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player, Young Player of the Year awards, and the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award, becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.\nRonaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season. United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out, United emerged victorious, winning 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw at the end of 120 minutes. As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year. With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968, and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.\nShortly after, Ronaldo was linked to a move to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. and he remained at United for another year. His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. United advanced to the final in Rome, where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.\n\n\n=== Real Madrid ===\n\n\n==== 2009–2015: World record transfer and consecutive Ballon d'Or wins ====\n\nIn 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then world record £80 million. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Ronaldo said, \"This is the completion of my boyhood dream, to be a Real Madrid player.\"\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win. He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich. His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. Despite scoring 33 goals in all competitions and contributing to Real Madrid's 96 points in La Liga, his first season with Madrid ended trophyless.\n\nFollowing Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was given No. 7 for the 2010–11 season and scored 53 goals, helping Madrid win the Copa del Rey, scoring the winning goal against rivals Barcelona in the El Clásico, his first trophy with Madrid. He also became the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals. In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.\nThe following season saw Ronaldo score 60 goals across all competitions, leading Madrid to their first league title in four years with a record 100 points and his runner-up finish to Lionel Messi in the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or. He scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás. In the 2012–13 season, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou. His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.\nFollowing the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January. He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.\n\nIn 2013–14 season, Ronaldo was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale and together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \"BBC\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). He continued prolific scoring, with 69 goals in 2013, winning the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup, scoring a penalty in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over city rivals Atlético Madrid, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams. As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe. Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, along with Liverpool's Luis Suárez On 4 May, Ronaldo scored a back-heeled volley in the closing moments of the match against Valencia, voted goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (LFP), giving him the Best Player in La Liga award.\nDuring the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, and after winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or, joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient. Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League. With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada. His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano. He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.\n\n\n==== 2015–2018: All-time Madrid top scorer and fifth Ballon d'Or ====\nCristiano Ronaldo became Real Madrid's all-time top scorer on 12 September 2015 against Espanyol, netting 230 goals in 203 matches, surpassing the previous record holder, Raúl. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.\n\nIn the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo. He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012. \nIn the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career. Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.\nOn 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year. A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On 3 April 2018, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3–0 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a \"PlayStation goal\" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches. \nIn the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3–1, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so. He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals. After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.\n\n\n=== Juventus ===\nRonaldo joined Juventus in 2018 for €100 million, the transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.\n\n\n==== 2018–2020: Consecutive Serie A titles ====\n\nOn 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against Chievo Verona. On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juve, he was sent off against Valencia, his first red card in 154 Champions League appearances. In the reverse (home) leg against Valencia, Cristiano won 100 Champions League matches, becoming the first ever player to do so.\nRonaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan. On 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3–0 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal. On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win against Atlético in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals. On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2–1 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy. With 21 goals and eight assists, Ronaldo won the league award for Most Valuable Player.\nOn 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen including breaking Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time. On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2–1 away win against Sampdoria. He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4–0 home win against Cagliari and became only the second player to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2–1 away win against SPAL. On 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2–0 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history. On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2–1 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, and becoming the second player after Edin Džeko to score 50 goals in three of Europe's top five major leagues. Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948. On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time. On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2–1 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season.\n\n\n==== 2020–2021: 100 Juve goals, Capocannoniere, and departure ====\nRonaldo played his 100th match in all competitions for Juventus on 13 December, scoring two penalties in a 3–1 away win over Genoa in the league to bring his goal tally to 79. On 2 March 2021, he scored a goal in a 3–0 win over Spezia in his 600th league match, to become the first player to score at least 20 goals in 12 consecutive seasons in the top five leagues of Europe. On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3–1 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat. With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy. Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.\nThe start of the following season came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window, despite Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reaching a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms, but the club pulled out of the deal, and later it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him, while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.\n\n\n=== Return to Manchester United ===\n\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical. Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21. The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.\nOn 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United. On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2–1 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition. Ronaldo proved to be crucial in the next Champions League fixtures, scoring various last minute goals to help United qualify for the round of 16 as group winners. On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals. Struggles ensued, with a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager, continuing for two months, until he scored in United's 2–0 win at home versus Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022, his first in the new year. He finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, but United finished in a disappointing sixth place and qualified for the UEFA Europa League; as a result, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.\nAfter growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo desired to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, but a move failed to materialise, with various European clubs refusing a transfer, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands. Shortly after, he fell out with manager Erik ten Hag who used him as a substitute, leading United to terminate his contract on 22 November, following an interview with Piers Morgan, where Ronaldo said that he felt \"betrayed\" by Ten Hag and criticised the management of the club.\n\n\n=== Al-Nassr ===\n\nOn 30 December 2022, Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club, signing a contract until 2025. Ronaldo received the highest football salary ever, at €200 million per year, including a guaranteed football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals bringing his total annual salary to €200 million.\nHe made his debut for Al-Nassr on 22 January 2023, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 win over Al-Ettifaq, and scored his first goal in a 2–2 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty. On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4–0 win over Al-Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal. According to the BBC, Ronaldo's transfer to Al-Nassr led a \"revolution\" in Asian football, with many players from other leagues, particularly those in Europe, transferring to Saudi Pro League clubs for the 2023–24 season.\nIn the final of the Arab Club Champions Cup on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2–1 after extra time. Ronaldo scored six goals in the competition. At the close of the year, Ronaldo scored 54 goals in all competitions for Al-Nassr and Portugal, making him the outright top scorer in 2023, reaching the same goalscoring record as in 2016. On 27 May 2024, in Al-Nassr's home fixture against Al-Ittihad, Ronaldo scored his 34th and 35th league goals of the campaign, surpassing Abderrazak Hamdallah's record for the most goals scored in a single Saudi Pro League season. He also became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in four different leagues, the English, Spanish, Italian and Saudi leagues. On 31 May, in a 5–4 penalty shoot-out defeat to Al-Hilal in the 2024 King Cup final following a 1–1 draw after extra-time (in which he scored his side's second spot kick), he equalled Rogério Ceni's record for most top-level matches by a male professional footballer (1,225).\nRonaldo finished the 2024–25 season with 25 league goals, becoming the league's top scorer for a second consecutive time.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\nAt the age of 18, Ronaldo made his debut for Portugal as a substitute against Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003. At UEFA Euro 2004, he scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to Greece in his eighth international appearance. Despite Portugal losing to Greece again in the final, Ronaldo made the team of the tournament, with two assists and two goals. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, at the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. Portugal reached the semi-finals, where Portugal lost to France, with Ronaldo being booed during their defeat, due to an incident that occurred in the quarter-finals against England. FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.\n\nOn 6 February 2007, Cristiano captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly against Brazil. He wore the number 7 shirt ahead of UEFA Euro 2008. Despite scoring eight goals in qualifications, the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the finals, netting the second goal of Portugal's 3–1 win in the group stage game against the Czech Republic. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a 3–2 loss to Germany.\nRonaldo failed to score in 2010 World Cup qualifying. He scored only one goal in the 2010 World Cup finals; despite this, he was named man of the match in all three group stage matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil. His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 demolishing of North Korea, which was his first international goal in 16 months. Two years later, in UEFA Euro 2012, Ronaldo was joint top scorer with three goals, enough for him to be included in the team of the tournament. During qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored eight goals. Despite this, Portugal did not qualify directly; Ronaldo scored all four goals against Sweden in the play-off to qualify. At the tournament in Brazil, Ronaldo assisted a last-minute 2–2 equaliser against the United States, and scored an 80th-minute winner in a 2–1 win over Ghana.\n\nIn 2016, Ronaldo led Portugal to their first-ever trophy at the UEFA Euro 2016, although he was subbed off in the 25th minute in the final against hosts France. He received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer, which gave him his fourth Ballon d'Or later that year. With the win, Portugal qualified and made its only appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia, where they finished in third place, with Ronaldo being named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches.\nIn the 2018 World Cup, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, in a 3–3 draw against Spain. The following match, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Morocco, breaking Puskás' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals. For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.\nRonaldo led Portugal to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. Ronaldo also became the first player to score at five European Championships. On 23 June 2021, Ronaldo scored two goals in the Euro 2020 match against France, breaking the men's goalscoring record previously held by Ali Daei.\n\nOn 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player. In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, thus becoming the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.\nIn the 2022 World Cup, on 24 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score at five World Cups, netting a penalty against Ghana. Following a dispute with manager Fernando Santos, after their last group game against South Korea, he was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament, and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000.\nOn 23 March 2023, Ronaldo scored a brace against Liechtenstein as he earned his 197th overall cap to become the most capped male footballer of all time. On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country. On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their qualifying group, following a 5–0 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice. The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).\nWith his start in Portugal's UEFA Euro 2024 opener against the Czech Republic, Ronaldo became the first player to feature in six European Championships, having previously been the first player to appear in five. Later that year, on 5 September, he scored his 900th career goal in a 2–1 victory over Croatia in the UEFA Nations League. On 8 June 2025, Ronaldo won his second UEFA Nations League title, helping Portugal defeat Spain in the final, scoring 8 goals in 9 games in the tournament.\n\n\n== Player profile ==\n\n\n=== Style of play ===\n\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark; he has also been known to use the flip-flap.\nHis strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. Ronaldo holds the record for the highest recorded jump in football history, measuring 2.93 metres (9 ft 7 in), which he achieved during a match against Manchester United while playing for Real Madrid in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2013. Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. An accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks. When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano. He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\"\n\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \"false\", \"attacking\", or \"goalscoring winger\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation. He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.\n\n\n=== Reception and image ===\n\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Argentina forward Lionel Messi. Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations. In a 2018 article for Bleacher Report, former NBA star Steve Nash compared Ronaldo to Michael Jordan: \"On the pitch, [Ronaldo's] learned how to make his play—less explosive in individual movements—more successful for the team, and in that, I see the greatness of Jordan.\" In the same article, Ronaldo was ranked first in the ranking of the 50 most influential people in sports culture for 2018.\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. On his longevity and \"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring. He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \"his relative immobility\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \"arrogant image\" on the pitch, with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \"victim\" because of how he was portrayed in the media. He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.\n\n\n=== Goal celebrations ===\nRonaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \"storming jump\" and \"turn\", before \"landing in spread-eagled fashion\" into his \"signature power stance\", while usually simultaneously exclaiming \"Sí\" (Spanish and Italian for \"yes\"). This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \"Siu\" or siuuu in the media. It has also been known as \"suiii\", \"siiuuu\", \"siii\" or \"Right Here Right Now\", formally the Cristiano Ronaldo celebration. Since Ronaldo first performed the gesture in 2013, it has been widely imitated by athletes and personalities both in and outside of football when celebrating scoring in respective sports or a significant achievement, and is widely regarded as the most iconic association football celebration of all time.\nThe gesture was first performed by Ronaldo on 7 August, during the 2013 International Champions Cup Final between Real Madrid and Chelsea. Ronaldo gave Madrid a 2–1 lead with a free kick when he headed in a cross from Isco, helping Madrid beat Chelsea 3–1 to claim the International Champions Cup and celebrating with his first \"Siuuu\". During an interview after the match against Chelsea when he first performed the gesture, Ronaldo explained he scored the goal and \"it just felt natural\" and \"didn't know where it came from\". He started doing it more often and when the supporters see it they are reminded of him.\nThe phrase \"siu\" is derived from Portuguese sim, meaning \"yes\". This was confirmed by Ronaldo in an interview in 2023, almost a decade since he first performed it. Ronaldo explained that the phrase \"Siuuu\" simply means yes, but \"meaning it very strongly\".\n\n\n=== Rivalry with Lionel Messi ===\n\nBoth Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals, have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season, and are the two leading goal scorers in history. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two. Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\" Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\" Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \"commander\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\"\nIn September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and \"gone\", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of \"sharing the stage\".\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Popularity and online following ===\n\nRonaldo was named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Demand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product. In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt. In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.\n\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers. The most-followed person on Facebook (171 million), most-followed on Instagram (650 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (115 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017. \nAfter announcing the creation of his YouTube channel, UR Cristiano on 21 August 2024, it became the fastest to reach the 1 million subscribers milestone, doing so in 90 minutes. The channel also became the fastest to reach 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 million subscribers. It also became the most subscribed channel in Portugal, surpassing the Portuguese Nick Jr. Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.\n\n\n=== Wealth and sponsorships ===\nWith earnings of €720 million (£615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. Forbes ranked Ronaldo as the highest-paid ahtlete in the world in 2016 ($88 million), 2017 ($93 million) and from 2023 to 2025 ($136 million, $260 million and $275 million respectively), and he has entered every top 10 since the ranking's inception in 2012. He has also been included in every annual ranking of the highest-paid athletes by Sportico: he was named the third highest-paid athlete of 2021 ($120 million) and 2022 ($115 million) and the highest-paid athlete of 2023 ($275 million) and 2024 ($260 million). He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career.\nRonaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012 and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014. Since his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition, soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games. Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion. His \"Sii\" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\n\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira. \nIn 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island. In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer. In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's \"11 for Health\" programme to raise awareness among kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity. In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for the Mangrove Care Forum Bali in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.\nRonaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating £5 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people. In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his €600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition. In August of the same year, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.\n\n\n=== Eponyms and honours ===\n\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus). In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia; the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team União da Madeira. At a ceremony held at the Belém Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\" In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque. On 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo. In 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is \"a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city\".\n\n\n=== Public art ===\n\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer, after Steven Gerrard, Pelé, and David Beckham, to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal in December 2014.\nThe unveiling of the rebranded Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live, A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust; however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.\n\n\n=== Business ventures ===\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008. In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013. He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014. \nIn September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \"Legacy\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums. Since 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manhã, Record and Jornal de Negócios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Expressão Livre. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive, and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nRonaldo's autobiography, titled Moments, was published in 2007. His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011. Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014. A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015. He appears as a playable character in the 2025 fighting game Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Family, children, and relationships ===\nCristiano Ronaldo is a Catholic. Within his ancestry, he is of (one-eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. His father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20. After her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.\nRonaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr., who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. Ronaldo Jr. is a youth footballer who plays for Portugal Under-15s. In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended. Then, in 2017, Ronaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy.\nRonaldo is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected another set of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived. On 11 August 2025, Rodríguez announced their engagement via Instagram.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nRonaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.\n\n\n=== Legal issues ===\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time. In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009. Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement. Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \"intentional defamation campaign\" with parts significantly \"altered and/or completely fabricated\", a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied. \nIn July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape. The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought £56 million in damages from Ronaldo. \nIn October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, \"acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute\" the case, despite the documents containing \"privileged communications\" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having \"intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement\" during the 2010 settlement with her. In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of \"cyber-hacked attorney–client privileged documents\" were actions representing \"abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process\".\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of match played 29 August 2025\n\n\n=== International ===\n\nAs of match played 8 June 2025\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\nSporting CP\n\nSupertaça Cândido de Oliveira: 2002\nManchester United\n\nPremier League: 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09\nFA Cup: 2003–04\nFootball League Cup: 2005–06, 2008–09\nFA Community Shield: 2007\nUEFA Champions League: 2007–08\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2008\nReal Madrid\n\nLa Liga: 2011–12, 2016–17\nCopa del Rey: 2010–11, 2013–14\nSupercopa de España: 2012, 2017\nUEFA Champions League: 2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18\nUEFA Super Cup: 2014, 2017\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2014, 2016, 2017\nJuventus\n\nSerie A: 2018–19, 2019–20\nCoppa Italia: 2020–21\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2018, 2020\nAl-Nassr\n\nArab Club Champions Cup: 2023\nPortugal\n\nUEFA European Championship: 2016\nUEFA Nations League: 2018–19, 2024–25\nIndividual\n\nBallon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2008\nThe Best FIFA Men's Player: 2016, 2017\nThe Best FIFA Special Award for Outstanding Career Achievement: 2021\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2007–08\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17\nThe Best Special Award of UEFA Champions League All-Time Top Scorer: 2024\nEuropean Golden Shoe: 2007–08, 2010–11, 2013–14, 2014–15\nFIFA Puskás Award: 2009\nFIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball: 2016\nUEFA European Championship Golden Boot: 2020\nUEFA Nations League Finals Top Scorer: 2019, 2025 (shared)\nUEFA Champions League top scorer: 2007–08, 2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2006–07, 2007–08\nLa Liga Best Player: 2013–14\nSerie A Footballer of the Year: 2019, 2020\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2007–08\nPichichi Trophy: 2010–11, 2013–14, 2014–15\nCapocannoniere: 2020–21\nSaudi Pro League Golden Boot: 2023–24, 2024–25\nGolden Foot: 2020\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\nFIFA FIFPRO World 11: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021\nPortuguese Sportsman of the Year: 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\nFPF Portuguese Player of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\nOrders\n\n Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa (Portuguese Royal Family)\n Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry\n Commander of the Order of Merit\n Cordão da Insígnia autonómica de distinção (Collar of the Autonomic Insignia of Distinction, Autonomous Region of Madeira)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\nList of top international men's football goal scorers by country\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\nList of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals\nList of men's footballers with the most official appearances\nList of footballers with 500 or more goals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nCaioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

        "title": "Jenna Ortega",
        "content": "Jenna Marie Ortega (born September 27, 2002) is an American actress. She began her career as a child and received recognition for her role as a younger version of Jane in The CW comedy-drama series Jane the Virgin (2014–2019). She then won an Imagen Award for her leading role as Harley Diaz in the Disney Channel series Stuck in the Middle (2016–2018). She played Ellie Alves in the thriller series You (2019) and starred in the family film Yes Day (2021), both for Netflix.\nOrtega received praise for her performance as a traumatized high school student in the drama film The Fallout (2021). She gained wide recognition for portraying Wednesday Addams in the Netflix horror-comedy series Wednesday (2022–present), for which she received nominations at the Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. She also starred in the slasher films Scream (2022), X (2022), and Scream VI (2023), and the fantasy film Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024).\nMedia publications have dubbed Ortega as \"Gen Z's scream queen\". She has been featured on the Power 100 list from The Hollywood Reporter in 2023 and the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in 2024. Ortega has also been noted for her fashion, in addition to supporting various charitable causes.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJenna Marie Ortega, the fourth of six siblings, was born on September 27, 2002, in Palm Desert, California. Her father, Edward Ortega, a former sheriff who works at a California district attorney's office, is of Mexican descent, and her mother, Natalie Ortega, who is of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, works as an emergency room nurse. Ortega's maternal great-grandmother was an undocumented immigrant from Sinaloa, Mexico, and her maternal grandfather was from Puerto Rico. Ortega grew up in La Quinta, California, and has described her childhood self as \"loud and extroverted\". She wanted to act from the age of six and begged her mother for three years to let her pursue that career path. Her mother attempted to distract her with activities including soccer and schoolwork. Soccer almost convinced Ortega to quit pursuing acting. Ortega's mother bought her a monologue book when she was nine and posted a video of her performing online. A casting director saw it and signed her to an agency.\nOrtega's mother began driving her to Los Angeles as often as five days per week for auditions, a journey that could take six hours round trip. She struggled to land roles because few parts existed for Latinas—and, it seemed, she \"didn't look [a certain] way\". Such rejection challenged her self-esteem. She considered dyeing her hair blonde in an attempt to book more roles. For the first year, with no connections in the film industry, Ortega only auditioned for TV commercials. She managed to secure parts in 12 national campaigns, including three for McDonald's. During the school week, she would act in Los Angeles for a few days and subsequently return home to attend school. She attended public school, including Amelia Earhart Elementary School and John Glenn Middle School. She stopped attending public school during eighth grade to act in Disney productions and got an apartment in Los Angeles after booking a role in Stuck in the Middle (2016–2018). During that time, Ortega acted in Los Angeles during the workweek and returned home on weekends.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2012–2017: Early acting roles and Disney ===\nOrtega made her acting debut in the sitcom Rob (2012) and later made a guest appearance in the CSI: NY episode \"Unspoken\". In 2013, she made her film debut in an uncredited role as the vice president's daughter in the superhero film Iron Man 3. In the same year, Ortega appeared in the horror film Insidious: Chapter 2 as a part of the supporting cast. From 2014 to 2019, Ortega had a recurring role on The CW comedy television series Jane the Virgin as a younger version of Jane Villanueva, who is portrayed by Gina Rodriguez as an adult. Declan Gallagher of Entertainment Weekly commended Ortega's performance, writing that \"she eschews the trappings of a typical child actor\". She also starred in the direct-to-video comedy film The Little Rascals Save the Day (2014) and the Netflix sitcom Richie Rich (2015). Ortega appeared in the comedy-drama film After Words (2015) as Anna Chapa, the daughter of a male escort. The Los Angeles Times praised her as \"adorable\", whereas The Arizona Republic found her \"horribly cloying\".\nFrom 2016 to 2018, Ortega led the Disney Channel sitcom Stuck in the Middle as Harley Diaz, an aspiring inventor who is the middle child of the seven siblings. Ortega drew inspiration from her own family and relationships with her siblings; she felt her experience starring on the show was akin to reality television. Common Sense Media praised Ortega's performance, saying she \"commands this role, pleading her case as a long-suffering middle kid while finding the humor in the many calamities that befall her efforts to shine\". Ortega garnered three Imagen Award nominations for Best Young Actor – Television, including a win in 2018. She also voiced Princess Isabel in Elena and the Secret of Avalor (2016) and Elena of Avalor (2016–2020).\n\n\n=== 2018–2021: Transition to mature roles ===\n\nIn 2018, Ortega starred in the film Saving Flora in the lead role of Dawn, a circus owner's daughter. After Stuck in the Middle ended, she aimed to act in more mature projects but found people assumed Disney roles were \"all you can do, or all you were meant for\". She considered quitting acting several times, saying that she \"was too old for the young roles and too young for the older roles\". In 2018, she was cast as Ellie Alves in the second season of the Netflix thriller series You, which was released on December 26, 2019. Like the show's first season, the second season received positive reviews; The Hollywood Reporter's Robyn Bahr noted Ortega as \"a standout performer\". Ortega was slated to return for the third and fourth seasons but was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts. \nOrtega played Phoebe, the love interest of Judah Lewis's character, in Netflix's horror film The Babysitter: Killer Queen, which was released in September 2020 to negative critical reviews. She also voiced a travel vlogger named Brooklynn in the Netflix animated show Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous (2020–2022). In 2021, she made her writing debut with the book It's All Love: Reflections for Your Heart & Soul, which contains a series of quotes and statements regarding faith and love. She starred in the Netflix comedy movie Yes Day (2021), portraying a stubborn teenager who wants more independence from her parents. It was released in March 2021 to mixed reviews. IndieWire lauded Ortega as \"very capable\", and the Associated Press referred to her as \"an impressively poised young actor\". \nOrtega had a leading role in the high-school drama film The Fallout, starring as a student who is navigating her emotional trauma after a school shooting. To prepare for the role, she looked at photographs and watched videos and interviews about school shootings; processing such events afterward \"kind of came naturally\". She also participated in the March for Our Lives movement, which led demonstrations in support of U.S. gun control legislation. The Fallout premiered at South by Southwest on March 17, 2021, and was released on HBO Max on January 27, 2022. The film received a positive response from critics, and Ortega's acting was applauded. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times described her performance as \"grounded and deeply moving\", while The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her \"beautifully nuanced turn understands the nothing-to-look-at-here façade and the chinks in the armor\".\n\n\n=== 2022–present: Mainstream breakthrough ===\nIn the slasher film Scream (2022)—the fifth film in the Scream franchise—Ortega played Tara Carpenter, on which she stated: \"I don't even think there are words in the English language to correctly express how happy, excited and nervous I am for this journey\". Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett cast Ortega because of her ability to play both horror and comic tones, and for the sound of her scream. She felt nervous about joining a well-known franchise, wanting to \"do it justice\" without \"ripping anybody off\". She said that working on the film taught her the importance of cast chemistry to the natural flow of the production process. Scream was a critical and commercial success, becoming the 28th-highest-grossing film of 2022. According to The A.V. Club, Ortega demonstrated \"incredible\" resilience and resolve in her role. She also won the MTV Movie Award for Most Frightened Performance.\nOrtega later appeared in the Foo Fighters–led horror film Studio 666 (2022). Reviewers said she was underused; according to the Los Angeles Times, \"[n]ot even [a] cameo from ... 2022's newly minted Scream Queen Jenna Ortega ... can offer true horror bona fides to this flick\". She then starred in the slasher film X (2022), which was directed and written by Ti West, who said Ortega was \"fearless in her commitment\". Ortega signed onto the project because of its script, calling it \"the most outrageous thing I've ever read\", and the opportunity to work with West. X became Ortega's best-reviewed film on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes; The Australian dubbed her and co-star Mia Goth \"scene-stealers\". The comedy-horror American Carnage was Ortega's final film release of 2022. The A.V. Club said she was continuing \"her streak as the new it-girl of horror with a stubborn punk persona that masks her care for other people\", while IGN lauded her \"no-shits-given shell\".\n\nIn May 2021, Ortega was cast as Wednesday Addams in the Netflix comedy-horror series Wednesday (2022), which she called a \"new chapter\" in her career. She auditioned through a Zoom call with director Tim Burton, during which she read a four-page monologue. The casting team felt her portrayal offered the character the necessary empathy. She was initially hesitant to accept the part because she wanted to focus on film acting and feared working on another television series would prevent her from booking the roles she wanted. To prepare for the role, Ortega underwent \"the most physical transformation I've ever done\", cutting her hair and dying it black, as well as altering her mannerisms, style of speaking, and facial expressions. She also learned to play cello and speak German, read the original Addams Family comic, and watched the 1960s television adaptation. Ortega called the production of Wednesday's first season her \"most overwhelming job\" in 2022, and spoke about being in a constant state of confusion and stress over the direction of the series and character. She said that she had never \"had to put my foot down on a set in the way that I had to on Wednesday\", believing that the initial writing was nonsensical from a character standpoint and did not suit Wednesday's personality. While filming some scenes, Ortega would change her lines without informing the crew.\nUpon Wednesday's release, critics widely praised Ortega: CNN said that her performance sets the series apart from similar spin-offs, being \"relentlessly strange, a portrait in unblinking intensity and oddly endearing all at once\". Wednesday became one of Netflix's most-watched shows, receiving over 1 billion viewing hours within a month. Ortega's performance received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, becoming the category's second-youngest nominee. She later spoke about her discomfort with becoming well known for her work on the show, having had a creatively unpleasant experience filming it.\nIn March 2023, Ortega hosted an episode of NBC's sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live. Ortega reprised her role as Tara Carpenter in Scream VI. The film was released in March 2023 and grossed over $169 million on a budget of $33–35 million. Deadline Hollywood attributed its box-office success partially to Ortega's star power. In a review, Variety's Owen Gleiberman praised her \"surly spunk\", and Slant Magazine said she \"fantastically embodie[d] the role\". In November 2023, Ortega exited the Scream franchise after her co-star Melissa Barrera was fired due to her pro-Palestinian comments on the Gaza war; she stated a subsequent film did not appear to be the \"right move\" due to the changing cast and crew. Earlier reports suggested that Ortega left the franchise because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of Wednesday's second season and an unsuccessful request for seven-figure pay. In the crime thriller film Finestkind (2023), Ortega played Mabel, a drug dealer's daughter who is seeking her own path in life. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to negative reviews. Many journalists said Ortega had been miscast. \n\nOrtega began 2024 with a starring role in the drama Miller's Girl, opposite Martin Freeman. The film tells the story of Cairo Sweet (Ortega), a high schooler whose writing ability captures her teacher's interest, which leads to a complicated relationship between the two. She called her character \"the most complex character that I've ever played\" and described the material as risky since she thought it would provoke discussions on topics people may find disturbing. RogerEbert.com's Christy Lemire found Ortega \"magnetic enough\" to maintain the viewer's interest, although she thought the character's motives were predictable and illogical; Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press dubbed the film \"a pointless, awkward turn\" in her career. Ortega appeared in and executive produced the romantic drama Winter Spring Summer or Fall, which premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Festival. Director Tiffany Paulsen described Ortega as the casting team's first choice for the role of Remi Aguilar, a driven genius who falls in love with a rebellious musician. She later starred in the music video for Sabrina Carpenter's song \"Taste\".\nOrtega starred in Burton's fantasy film Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024)—a sequel to Beetlejuice (1988)—playing Astrid Deetz, the cynical teenage daughter of Lydia Deetz. It opened the 81st Venice International Film Festival and received generally positive reviews. Rolling Stone said Ortega was an \"unimpeachable\" casting choice and commended the emotions she conveyed using a \"world-class deadpan stare\". In a more negative review, The Independent stated that she \"can't help but seem a little bland and strait-laced\" acting opposite Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse. The film has grossed $451 million worldwide; publications such as Boxoffice Pro and TheWrap credited Ortega for attracting younger audiences, particularly members of Generation Z. \nIn the dark comedy Death of a Unicorn (2025), Paul Rudd and Ortega starred as a father and daughter who accidentally kill a unicorn, leading to brutal consequences. Ortega said she was drawn to the project because of its original and unique script. The film received mixed reviews. Peter Travers of ABC News said Ortega \"takes this horror comedy into human territory and gives it a beating heart\", bringing energy to the story despite its perceived shortcomings. Another review in IGN described her portrayal as a \"wonderfully lived-in performance\" of a withdrawn youth, praising her ability to \"inject great thought and subtext into any scenario\". She next featured in Trey Edward Shults' Hurry Up Tomorrow, co-starring alongside Abel Tesfaye and Barry Keoghan. Ortega played Anima, a troubled young woman who pulls Tesfaye's character into an existential odyssey. The film was panned by critics, but Ortega's performance was generally praised. Clint Worthington of RogerEbert.com felt that she did \"her best to uplift her half of the movie\", while Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter commended her \"intense\" energy. IndieWire's Charles Bramesco, however, dismissed her performance as \"imitative and hollow\".\nOrtega reprised her role as Wednesday in the second season of Wednesday. She became a producer, which she described as a \"natural progression\" since the first season was \"naturally already very collaborative\". Ortega helped oversee the costumes, characters, and scripts.\n\n\n==== Upcoming projects ====\nOrtega has joined the cast of Klara and the Sun (2025) to be directed by Taika Waititi.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Activism and philanthropy ===\nOrtega has used her platform to support various causes, including Pride Over Prejudice—a DoSomething campaign that advocates for immigrants and refugees—the National Bullying Prevention Center, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, Planned Parenthood, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS. She is pro-immigration and anti-discrimination, telling Teen Vogue: \"It's important to embrace your culture today because there are so many different ethnicities in America. At the end of the day, you are you. You've got to stay true to yourself, and you can't change yourself in order to fit in or to make someone else feel comfortable.\" Ortega is also an advocate for women's rights.\nIn 2016, Ortega organized a meet-and-greet event for fans to raise money for a young girl with cancer. At the 2018 Radio Disney Music Awards, Ortega wore a jacket displaying the words \"I Do Care and U Should Too\" in response to the clothing First Lady of the United States Melania Trump wore on a visit to see immigrant children who were being housed without their parents. Trump's jacket read, \"I Really Don't Care, Do U?\". Ortega's protest gained significant media coverage; she told the Associated Press that Trump's apparel displayed a lack of judgement and as the first lady, she ought to show concern for migrant children. Ortega later said: \"We should all care about each other and our country ... we are one country under God\". In 2019, Ortega appeared at numerous We Day benefit concerts across the U.S. and Canada to raise funds for WE Charity.\nIn 2023, Ortega, as part of a group called Artists4Ceasefire, signed a letter urging the United States Congress and President Joe Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip during the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. She later condemned the Tel al-Sultan attack and emphasized the need for a ceasefire.\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\nIn 2020, Ortega was named a brand ambassador for the cosmetics manufacturer Neutrogena and was the face of its \"My Quinceañera Journey\" campaign. In 2023, she became an ambassador for the sportswear company Adidas and the luxury fashion brand Dior. She was the face of Adidas Sportswear, the company's first new line in 50 years, as well as one of the faces of the #DareInGrisDior campaign. She starred alongside Danny Ramirez, Olivia Negron, and Patricia Mauceri in an advertisement for Doritos that aired at the Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024. The A.V. Club enjoyed the ad but opined that fans of Wednesday would be dissatisfied by Ortega's lack of goth,\nwhile TVLine stated that her limited screen time was \"a real miscalculation\".\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nOrtega was initially inspired to pursue acting after watching Dakota Fanning in the 2004 thriller film Man on Fire. Ortega was unable to understand how a young child could perform in a way that could scare her so much; she analyzed the film several times and decided she wanted to be \"the Puerto Rican version of [Fanning]\". She also admired Fanning's sister, Elle, and followed both of their careers as a child. As she matured, Ortega aspired to be \"the female version\" of Denzel Washington, who appeared alongside Dakota Fanning in Man on Fire. She also admires Gina Rodriguez and fellow Disney Channel stars Selena Gomez and Zendaya. Ortega said she admires Rodriguez because they are both Latina actresses who struggled to break into the acting industry due to their lack of connections. In 2021, Ortega named Riz Ahmed as a career role model and praised his acting, manner of speaking, and activism.\n\n\n=== Acting style and role choices ===\nMegan Park, who directed Ortega in The Fallout, said that she knows \"when to give her all and when to hold back\" while acting, adding that \"to have that understanding of herself as a performer at such a young age\" is extremely rare. Burton compared Ortega's acting style to silent film acting, saying she expresses emotion through her eyes without words. Ortega says she tries not to be more prepared than necessary for a scene because \"you never know what you're going to say next or what your next facial expression is going to be\" in real life.\nThe Dodge College professor and agent Joe Rosenberg describes Ortega as an actress who has \"a feel for the right project at the right time\" and is \"savvy\" with her role choices. Ortega feels taking more varied acting roles is important to her to avoid being typecast; she told Entertainment Tonight in 2021 that she did not want to be \"pigeonholed as an actor\" and that her desire to accept the most diverse roles possible made the transition to mature roles easier for her. Ortega stated that she looks for projects that will have a \"forever effect\" for her, such as The Fallout. She has said she feels most comfortable starring in horror works, describing such projects as \"very therapeutic\". In 2023, Ortega said she is mindful of not \"over-indexing on the gore scale\" and feels \"very conflicted\" about her interests because there is \"a part of me that always feels like the girl in the Coachella Valley\".\n\n\n== Media image ==\n\nCommenting on Ortega's off-screen persona, Who What Wear wrote in 2022 that she is \"poised, mature, and wise beyond her years\" while providing \"an essence of relatability\". A 2023 Harper's Bazaar story describes her as \"quiet and contemplative\", while Vanity Fair wrote that she has a \"black-hole persona\" but is \"much warmer and more cheerful than you'd expect\". Ortega has been noted for her work in horror and has been described as a horror icon by journalists. Media publications have dubbed her \"Gen Z's scream queen\", and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association called her the \"scream queen for the 21st century\". Ortega attributes her \"instinctive\" scream and \"really ugly crying face\" for the positive reception her horror work has received from audiences.\nIn 2018, The Hollywood Reporter named Ortega one of \"Hollywood's Top 30 Stars Under Age 18\". The magazine later referred to her as the \"Next Big Thing\" in 2022 and \"The Gen Z Obsession\" in 2024. In 2023, Ortega appeared on Variety's \"Young Hollywood Impact Report\", a list of breakthrough performers, and The Hollywood Reporter's Power 100, a list of the most powerful women in entertainment. Complex also listed her among the best actors in their 20s. Forbes included her on the 2024 edition of its 30 Under 30 in the Hollywood & Entertainment category.\nOrtega has also been called a style icon by Harper's Bazaar. Her initial red-carpet style featured bright colors, patterned clothing, and many accessories. Enrique Melendez, her stylist, dressed Ortega in RED Valentino and Thom Browne, wanting her wardrobe to be age-appropriate, fashionable, and stylistically interesting. They later tried to move away from the \"feminine and flirty and frilly\" style of other Disney actresses. After her role in You, Ortega began wearing heavier makeup and darker clothing. Media publications said her later style borrowed from Wednesday's while incorporating high fashion and described it as goth glam. According to Vogue, her off-screen style has a \"dark, gothic fashion sensibility\". Ortega said that playing Wednesday has \"changed my taste a lot\" and she has \"a hard time getting her off of me, at least clothing-wise\".\nOrtega is active on Instagram but has described social media overall as being a \"comparing game\" and \"very manipulative\". She has said she became fearful of her comments on social media being misinterpreted following the release of Wednesday, adding: \"Because I naturally tend to be sarcastic or dry, it's very easy for me to find myself in trouble ... [People] see your vulnerability and twist it in a way that you don't always expect.\" As a minor, Ortega was sent explicit images of herself that were AI-generated, which later led to her deleting her Twitter account.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOrtega stated that she would like to be a \"private person\" and not discuss her romantic life publicly, believing that it distracts audiences from her work. She has described the concept of celebrities as \"absolutely ridiculous\". Ortega has said that her friends and family give her a sense of safety that helps her deal with the more challenging parts of her career, adding that her family \"keep[s] [her] feet on the ground\". She states that growing up in an industry dominated by adults forced her to mature faster than normal.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nJenna Ortega on Instagram\nJenna Ortega at IMDb",

        "title": "F1 (film)",
        "content": "F1 (marketed as F1 the Movie) is a 2025 American sports drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger. The film stars Brad Pitt as Formula One (F1) racing driver Sonny Hayes, who returns after a 30-year absence to save his former teammate's underdog team, APXGP, from collapse. Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, and Javier Bardem also star in supporting roles.\nDevelopment of the film began in December 2021 with Pitt, Kosinski, Kruger, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer attached to the project; the latter three had previously collaborated together on Top Gun: Maverick (2022). Supporting cast members were revealed in early 2023, before the start of principal photography at Silverstone that July. Filming also took place during Grand Prix weekends of the 2023 and 2024 World Championships, with the collaboration of the FIA, the governing body of F1. Racing sequences were adapted from the real-life races, with F1 teams and drivers appearing throughout, including Lewis Hamilton, who was also a producer. Hans Zimmer composed the film's score, while numerous artists contributed to its soundtrack.\nF1 premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 16, 2025, and was released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on June 27. The film received positive reviews from critics and emerged as a commercial success grossing $615 million worldwide against a $200–300 million budget, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2025, the highest-grossing auto racing film, the highest-grossing film by Apple Studios and the highest-grossing film of Pitt's career.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAging American former Formula One (F1) prodigy Sonny Hayes has spent the last 30 years living as a racer-for-hire, following a career-ending crash at the 1993 Spanish Grand Prix that has left him burdened by the failure to live up to his potential. After winning the 24 Hours of Daytona, he is approached by his former teammate Rubén Cervantes, owner of the struggling APXGP F1 team, who asks him to be their second driver. Rubén explains that unless APXGP wins one of the nine remaining Grands Prix of the season, his investors will sell the team. Sonny reluctantly agrees after Rubén insists that victory will prove he is the \"best in the world.\"\nAt the Silverstone track, Sonny meets the team, including technical director Kate McKenna and ambitious and arrogant British rookie Joshua Pearce. Joshua fears the failing APXGP could derail his career, and is determined to attract interest from another team. Sonny struggles with the modern F1 machinery but quickly diagnoses APXGP's weaknesses. Sonny proposes to Kate that the cars be upgraded with enhanced maneuverability to compensate for their speed disadvantage.\nOn his return at the British Grand Prix, Sonny and Joshua race against each other rather than cooperating, resulting in both crashing out. Acknowledging the team's need to secure a points finish, Sonny exploits the rules at the Hungarian Grand Prix by deliberately colliding with rivals to trigger safety car periods. This allows Joshua to close the gap to the frontrunners and secure APXGP's first top-ten finish. During the rain-affected Italian Grand Prix, Sonny advises Joshua to remain on slick tires, trading grip for speed and elevating him to second place. Ignoring Sonny's instruction to wait for a straight before overtaking Max Verstappen, Joshua skids off the track and his car bursts into flames. Although rescued by Sonny, Joshua misses the next three races while recovering, while his mother and the press criticize Sonny's high-risk approach.\nAn increasingly arrogant Joshua returns at the Belgian Grand Prix and deliberately forces Sonny into a crash. Afterward, Sonny criticizes him for setting the team back. Seeking to ease tensions, Kate organizes a poker game to highlight their similar backgrounds, after which Sonny and Kate spend the night together. He later admits to her that he races to recapture the rare moments when he feels untouchable.\nFollowing an anonymous tip alleging Kate's car upgrades were illegal, APXGP is forced to remove them, leaving the team at a disadvantage. Frustrated—and realizing he had skipped his ritual of drawing a random playing card—Sonny drives recklessly during the Las Vegas Grand Prix and crashes. While he recovers, Rubén discovers that Sonny's 1993 injuries left him medically unfit for F1, with risks of blindness or death, and fires him for his own safety. APXGP board member Peter Banning then admits to Sonny that he orchestrated both his signing and the anonymous complaint to sabotage the team and force its sale, offering Sonny the role of team principal if he lets APXGP fail. Meanwhile, Joshua begins applying Sonny's racing techniques, admits fault for his earlier crash, and recommits himself to the team over personal glory. Concealing his blurred vision and headaches, Sonny persuades Rubén to let him return, just as the FIA clears Kate and restores her upgrades.\nAt the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Joshua battles Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc for the lead. After Sonny is caught in a minor crash, the race is red-flagged, allowing APXGP to repair both cars before a three-lap sprint to the finish. On the restart, Sonny overtakes Leclerc and sacrifices his own chance of victory by holding off Hamilton so Joshua can move into first. On the final lap, Hamilton and Joshua collide, clearing the way for Sonny to take his first F1 win and secure APXGP's future. Joshua is offered a seat with Mercedes, but declines. As the team celebrates, Sonny quietly prepares to leave, parting with Joshua on good terms and promising to see Kate soon. Some time later, he lines up for the Baja 1000. When asked what he is racing for, Sonny just laughs.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nBrad Pitt as Sonny Hayes, a nomadic racer-for-hire and former 1990s Formula One driver for Lotus who returns to F1 with APXGP\nDamson Idris as Joshua Pearce, a hotshot rookie who drives for APXGP, becoming Sonny's teammate and main rival\nKerry Condon as Kate McKenna, the APXGP technical director and Sonny's love interest\nJavier Bardem as Ruben Cervantes, the APXGP team owner, Sonny's friend and former Lotus teammate\nTobias Menzies as Peter Banning, a sly, scheming APXGP board member\nKim Bodnia as Kaspar Smolinski, the APXGP team principal\nSarah Niles as Bernadette Pearce, Joshua's mother\nWill Merrick as Hugh Nickleby, Sonny's APXGP race engineer\nJoseph Balderrama as Rico Fazio, Joshua's APXGP race engineer\nAbdul Salis as Dodge Dowda, the APXGP chief mechanic\nCallie Cooke as Jodie, a clumsy APXGP pit stop tire gunner\nSamson Kayo as Cashman, Joshua's cousin and manager\nSimon Kunz as Don Cavendish, an antagonistic sports commentator during the F1 races that Sonny participated\nLiz Kingsman as Lisbeth Bampton, the APXGP PR agent\nLuciano Bacheta as Luca Cortez, the APXGP reserve driver\nShea Whigham as Chip Hart, owner of Chip Hart Racing, for whom Sonny drives the 24 Hours of Daytona\nKyle Rankin as Cale Kelso, one of Sonny's co-drivers for Chip Hart Racing in the 24 Hours of Daytona\nSimone Ashley was cast in an undisclosed role, but her appearance was cut to only a cameo, credited as herself. Additionally, Craig Dolby and Duncan Tappy acted as stunt drivers, alongside Bacheta.\n\n\n=== Formula One drivers, personnel and others ===\nThe film is based on the 2023 Formula One season and was filmed during both the 2023 and 2024 seasons. As a result, many Formula One drivers and personnel appear in the film as themselves. The drivers are as follows, with the teams and achievements they had at the time:\n\nAlexander Albon of Thailand, driver for Williams\nFernando Alonso, two-time World Drivers' Champion of Spain, driver for Aston Martin\nOliver Bearman from the United Kingdom, driver for Ferrari and Haas\nValtteri Bottas of Finland, driver for Alfa Romeo\nFranco Colapinto of Argentina, driver for Williams.\nNyck de Vries of the Netherlands, driver for AlphaTauri\nJack Doohan of Australia, driver for Alpine\nPierre Gasly of France, driver for Alpine\nZhou Guanyu of China, driver for Alfa Romeo\nLewis Hamilton, seven-time World Drivers' Champion of the United Kingdom, driver for Mercedes.\nNico Hülkenberg of Germany, driver for Haas\nLiam Lawson of New Zealand, driver for AlphaTauri\nCharles Leclerc of Monaco, driver for Ferrari\nKevin Magnussen of Denmark, driver for Haas\nLando Norris of the United Kingdom, driver for McLaren\nEsteban Ocon of France, driver for Alpine\nSergio Pérez of Mexico, driver for Red Bull Racing\nOscar Piastri of Australia, driver for McLaren\nDaniel Ricciardo of Australia, driver for AlphaTauri\nGeorge Russell of the United Kingdom, driver for Mercedes\nCarlos Sainz Jr. of Spain, driver for Ferrari\nLogan Sargeant of the United States, driver for Williams\nLance Stroll of Canada, driver for Aston Martin\nYuki Tsunoda of Japan, driver for AlphaTauri\nMax Verstappen, two-time World Drivers' Champion of the Netherlands, driver for Red Bull Racing\nFormula One personnel that appear in the film include:\n\nZak Brown, CEO of McLaren\nStefano Domenicali, CEO of the Formula One Group\nChristian Horner, team principal and CEO of Red Bull Racing\nGuenther Steiner, team principal of Haas\nLawrence Stroll, owner and chairman of Aston Martin and father of Lance Stroll\nFrédéric Vasseur, team principal of Ferrari\nJames Vowles, team principal of Williams\nToto Wolff, team principal, CEO, and co-owner of Mercedes\nSky Sports F1 commentators Martin Brundle and David Croft provide commentary for races depicted in the film. Leigh Diffey provides commentary for the 24 Hours of Daytona scene. Cameo appearances include Porsche factory driver Patrick Long as Sonny's other co-driver at the 24 Hours of Daytona race, motorsport presenters Rachel Brookes, Natalie Pinkham, and Will Buxton, Dutch DJ Tiësto and social media influencers Sabrina Bahsoon and Simon Minter.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nOn December 3, 2021, a bidding war commenced for an untitled film starring Brad Pitt, with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Joseph Kosinski, and screenwriter Ehren Kruger, who previously worked on Top Gun: Maverick (2022), on board in their respective roles. Sources said F1 driver Lewis Hamilton was also involved in the film as both a producer and actor. Studios involved in the bidding were Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Walt Disney Pictures, and streaming platforms Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. Pitt was paid $30 million for his involvement.\nIn November 2022, Claudio Miranda announced he would be the film's cinematographer. In April 2023, Damson Idris was hired after a lengthy casting process, which included a shortlist of actors driving the car in January 2023. Kerry Condon and Tobias Menzies would join the cast in the following months. Sarah Niles and Simone Ashley also joined the cast. However, in June 2025, Kosinski revealed that Ashley's role had been cut from the film.\nOn July 5, 2024, the title F1 was announced. A teaser trailer premiered before the 2024 British Grand Prix. Kruger received sole credit for the film's screenplay, along with story credit with Kosinski. Jez Butterworth, Kara Smith, Aaron Sorkin, and Christopher Storer earned off-screen \"Additional Literary Material\" credit.\nIn May 2024, Puck's Matthew Belloni reported the film's budget to be $300 million. Bruckheimer and Kosinski disputed the claim; the former cited rebates and sponsorships as lowering the budget, and the latter said: \"I've never had an experience where they were off by this much on a film. I'm not sure where that number came from.\" In 2025, ahead of the film's theatrical release, some industry sources reported the film's budget to be $200 million, though others still claimed the $300 million figure (Apple would regularly dish out $200 million for its pictures).\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPrior to filming, Pitt and Idris tested Formula Three and Formula Two cars at Paul Ricard in France. The Dallara F2 2018 was stretched, widened and modified with a Formula One aerodynamic package created by Mercedes Applied Science and run by Carlin Motorsport. Six visually identical chassis were created in total, some powered by the Mecachrome V634, some by GP3 V6 engines, and one by an electric motor, which was used to prevent overheating for shots in the pit lane. Another six remote-controlled chassis were used to film crashes.\nIn July 2023, principal photography began at the Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom, including filming during the British Grand Prix weekend between July 7–9, outside of the official F1 sessions. The APXGP team had its own garage and motorhome during the weekend and their car was kept on display alongside other F1 cars during the mandatory \"show and tell\" session before the track action. Pitt was present with the actual drivers at the drivers' briefing and he and Idris stood alongside the drivers during the national anthem before the race. Their two cars were placed at the back of the grid with stunt drivers driving a part of the formation lap.\nApple designed a custom onboard camera for the car based on iPhone and powered by its A-series system on a chip. The camera technology used for the fast-paced shots had evolved since Top Gun: Maverick. With help from Sony, the cameras were shrunk to about a quarter of the size of those from Maverick such that up to four cameras could be set up onto the cars at a time, with minimal effect to weight. The camera bodies and RF transmitters were stashed in the floor of the cars. Panavision also designed a special remote control that allowed the cameras on the cars to create panning movements.\nFilming also took place at the Hungaroring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, Zandvoort, Suzuka, Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Las Vegas, Yas Marina, and Brands Hatch—which was used as a stand-in for the onboard Jerez footage and the fiery crash scene in Italian Grand Prix. At the 2024 24 Hours of Daytona, the #120 Wright Motorsports Porsche 911 GT3 R competed with a livery of the fictional \"Chip Hart Racing\" team from the film, with multiple replicas of it and the #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3 used for filming. A camera-mounted Lola B2K/10 was used as a filming car for high-speed shots. The filming car struggled to keep up with the modified F2 cars and by the time filming had shifted to Hungary, the car lost oil pressure and had a pump failure, which led to it being scrapped and replaced by one of the GP3-engined APXGP cars. The APXGP headquarters scenes were filmed at the McLaren Technology Centre, while Williams provided its wind tunnel for some shots, and the racing simulator scenes were filmed at the Mercedes headquarters in Brackley.\nSpeaking with former F1 driver and Sky Sports F1 pundit Martin Brundle at the 2023 British Grand Prix, Pitt confirmed Javier Bardem would star. Later that month, ESPN reported that the film was titled Apex, but later retracted this claim.\nThe week after filming had started at the British Grand Prix, the SAG-AFTRA strike began, resulting in the lead actors not being available and a reduced crew consisting of only Equity actors sent to races from the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards. Filming was then forced to continue through the 2024 season to make up for the lost races.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nDuring the 2024 Austrian Grand Prix, Hans Zimmer announced he would be composing the score for the film, marking his second collaboration with Kosinski after Top Gun: Maverick. It is also Zimmer's second Formula One-related score, following the Ron Howard-directed film Rush (2013). Zimmer co-composed the score with Steve Mazzaro, creating what Kosinski described as a musical identity that reflects Formula One's dual nature, \"a sport that straddles both the past and the present, with its rich history and cutting-edge technology.\"\nZimmer crafted a \"hybrid\" score combining orchestra and electronic music. He envisioned the orchestra as \"the human that sits inside the machine,\" while the electronics represented the machine itself. Discussions with producer and F1 champion Lewis Hamilton helped shape Zimmer's understanding of that relationship, influencing how the music was written. Electronic music, Zimmer noted, was also key to capturing the unpredictability of racing. \"With synthesizers, it’s the same as in the race – you don’t quite know who’s going to do what next. There’s always the element of surprise built in, and I think that’s very important in a film like this: you score for surprise.\"\nThe score features guitarist Tim Henson, drummer Marco Minnemann and members of Zimmer's touring band. This marks Zimmer's 13th collaboration with Bruckheimer, beginning with Days of Thunder (1990). Central to the score is a recurring motif for Pitt's character, Sonny Hayes, which Zimmer described as a \"gunslinger motif.\" Zimmer and Mazzaro paid attention to the way the score interacts with the film's sound design and visuals.\nThe film's soundtrack, F1 the Album, was released day-and-date with the film's North American debut. Don Toliver and Doja Cat released the lead single \"Lose My Mind\" on April 30, 2025, followed by Rosé's \"Messy\" on May 8, Myke Towers's \"Baja California\" on May 23,  Tate McRae's \"Just Keep Watching\" on May 30, and Ed Sheeran's \"Drive\" on June 20. Additional promotional singles include \"No Room for a Saint\" by Dom Dolla, \"Bad as I Used to Be\" by Chris Stapleton, \"OMG!\" by Tiësto and Sexyy Red, and \"Underdog\" by Roddy Ricch.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nRyan Tudhope was the VFX supervisor, and Framestore provided post-production services on the film, citing involvement from their studios in Montreal, London and Mumbai. Tudhope returned to collaborate with director Joseph Kosinski, leveraging techniques they used on Top Gun: Maverick to re-skin jets to replace F1 cars captured during real Grands Prix with the fictional black-and-gold APXGP cars.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\n\nThe film was marketed under the title F1 the Movie.\nAhead of its release, Apple gave the film a comedic spotlight at its 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference, held on 9 June. The keynote opened with Craig Federighi at the wheel of the APXGP car—complete with Apple CarPlay on board—navigating the roof of Apple Park as if running a solo Grand Prix, with Tim Cook as his race director. \nTwo official trailers followed: the first debuted during the weekend of the 2024 British Grand Prix, and the second premiered ahead of the 2025 Australian Grand Prix. A television spot was also aired during Super Bowl LIX.\nOn 11 June 2025, Apple released a “haptic trailer” for the film; when played on the Apple TV app, the Taptic Engine on supported iPhones vibrates and pulses sync with the on-screen action.\nSponsorships from various brands featured in the film brought in at least $40 million, according to Forbes estimates. Many of the brands were featured on the APXGP cars and clothing as team sponsors, such as Expensify, GEICO, SharkNinja, MSC Cruises and EA Sports. Other sponsors that featured on the cars such as IWC Schaffhausen released watches themed on APXGP's black and gold colors, Tommy Hilfiger launched a line of clothing, and Mercedes-AMG revealed a limited APXGP-edition Mercedes-AMG GT 63. The F1 25 game by EA Sports featured the APXGP livery as it appears in the film alongside scenarios that players can undertake. Peak and GEICO were sponsors of the fictional \"Chip Hart Racing\" (played by Wright Motorsports in IMSA) team from the 24 Hours of Daytona scenes. Heineken 0.0 released a commercial for their product featuring Pitt and Idris as F1 drivers.\nAt the 2025 24 Hours of Le Mans, the #90 Manthey Racing Porsche 911 GT3 R ran a livery similar to the one used for filming at the 2024 24 Hours of Daytona. At the 2025 Sahlen's Six Hours of The Glen the following weekend, the same #120 Wright Motorsports Porsche 911 GT3 R used for filming in 2024 ran the race with the livery from the film. The drivers, crew and IMSA personnel were also given a private screening.\nHot Wheels released of a 1:64-scale die-cast model of the #7 APXGP car driven by Brad Pitt's character in the film. In certain Latin American countries, McDonald's launched a special combo in partnership with F1, where customers had the option to pay extra to get a 1:43 scale APXGP or McDonald's-liveried Bburago model car. Some McDonald's outlets in São Paulo also had full-size F1 cars on display.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn June 2022, Apple acquired distribution rights in a package deal worth $130–140 million before above-the-line compensation. In June 2024, Warner Bros. Pictures acquired the theatrical, home entertainment and digital purchase distribution rights from Apple; Apple retains SVOD rights and the film will become available on Apple TV+ at a later date. The film had an early IMAX screening on June 23, 2025. The film was released in the IMAX format internationally on June 25, 2025, and was released domestically on June 27, 2025. A private screening was held in Monaco during the Cannes Film Festival for the drivers of the 2025 F1 season. Due to popular demand, the film was re-released in IMAX on August 8, 2025.\nThe film had its world premiere on June 16, 2025, at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City, with the cast and 2025 F1 drivers in attendance. The European premiere was held on June 23 at Empire Leicester Square in London. A Qatar Airways flight from Montreal to New York was chartered for the F1 drivers and team principals to attend the premiere following the Canadian Grand Prix.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nF1 was released on digital on August 22, 2025.\n\n\n== Cybercrime ==\nThe release of the film coincided with a significant rise in cybercrime, as scammers exploited the film's popularity by creating fake live streaming sites and fraudulent toy giveaways linked to a bogus McDonald's–Apple promotion, tricking users into sharing personal and financial information. Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky confirmed that these scams were widespread.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of September 3, 2025, F1 has grossed $188.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $427 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $615.4 million. Opening to $146.3 million worldwide, the film is considered to be Apple Studios's first box office hit, and the first film from the studio to top the box office on its opening weekend. It surpassed $200 million in its second weekend. In early August, it became the highest-grossing Brad Pitt film in history, surpassing the $540 million theatrical run of World War Z (2013).\nIn the United States and Canada, F1 was released alongside M3GAN 2.0, and was projected to gross anywhere from $35 million to $60 million in its opening weekend, with most industry estimates around $40 million. The film made $10 million in previews, including $7 million from Thursday showings. It debuted to $57 million, topping the box office. In its second weekend, the film made $26.1 million, dropping 54%, finishing second behind newcomer Jurassic World Rebirth, and surpassing Napoleon (2023) to become Apple Studios' highest-grossing film. F1 made $13.1 million in its third weekend, finishing third behind Superman and Jurassic World Rebirth.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 351 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Driven by Brad Pitt's laidback magnetism and sporting a souped-up engine courtesy of Joseph Kosinski's kinetic direction, F1 the Movie brings vintage cool across the finish line.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 56 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 92% overall positive score, with 78% saying they would definitely recommend the film. \nBBC's Nicholas Barber gave the film two stars out of five and wrote: \"Formula One enthusiasts may disagree, and they may be delighted that their beloved motorsport has been put on the big screen in such a laudatory fashion. Everyone else: this is not where you want to be.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times deemed F1 to be \"an enjoyably arranged collection of all the visual attractions and narrative clichés that money can buy\".\n\n\n=== In motorsport media ===\nReception within motorsport media was mixed. Ben Hunt of Autosport said it was \"good for non-F1 fans\", whereas Mark Mann-Bryans said it was \"not good for anyone watching\", lauding the production quality and soundtrack but criticising the plot and female character tropes. Fred Smith of Road & Track said the film was \"entertaining, but hardcore racing fans will wince\". Phillip Horton of Autoweek described the film as \"solid enough nonsense for a little bit of escapism\".\nKaty Fairman of Motor Sport described the film as \"comedically unrealistic\", adding that \"with the level of access they had into [F1] itself, it felt a little like [APXGP] before Sonny Hayes showed up: pointless\". Mixed reviews also came from journalists at The Race, with praise for the racing sequences and criticism for its depiction of women in motorsport and plot. Top Gear's Jason Barlow described it as \"a crowd-pleasing, feel-good blockbuster\". Chris Medland of Racer described the racing footage as \"spectacular\", but criticised the character development—particularly that of Kate McKenna—and added that \"for some it might be too hard to get lost in the APXGP world when you know so much about the real one that it was filmed in—as incredible as that world looks\".\nDefending four-time World Drivers' Champion Max Verstappen skipped the private screening for F1 drivers and the New York premiere, and Carlos Sainz Jr. cautioned \"pure F1 fans\" to \"be open-minded to Hollywood films\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Future ==\nFollowing the early box office success of the film, Variety reported that a sequel was being discussed and the Financial Times reported on the possibility of a franchise.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of auto racing films\nF1 25\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nF1 at IMDb\nF1 at  Rotten Tomatoes",

Shortly before the move, Millie proposes to Tim at a going-away party held by their friends but he hesitates to respond, embarrassing her.\nWhile hiking near their new home, they fall into the cave from the prologue during a rainstorm and decide to camp inside for the night. They find the same pool of water from which the dogs in the prologue drank; Tim drinks from the pool but Millie refuses, then Tim recalls traumatic details of the night he found his mother in bed with his father's decaying corpse. Upon waking up the next morning, Tim and Millie find their legs partially stuck together but dismiss the incident after separating. Tim begins to experience episodes where he is inexplicably physically drawn to Millie, confusing and frustrating them both. Tim visits a doctor, who dismisses his symptoms as panic attacks and prescribes him muscle relaxant pills before mentioning that a local couple, Simon and Keri, recently went missing. Millie's coworker Jamie McCabe shows up at their home to welcome them to the neighborhood, and she invites him in for dinner. The couple recounts their experience at the cave, which Jamie explains was a New Age church before it caved in.\nMillie drops Tim off at the train station for a gig, but Tim experiences another episode and drags himself to Millie's workplace. An outraged Millie confronts him in a bathroom stall, whereupon they have sex, after which their genitals become stuck together. After they painfully force themselves to separate, Jamie spots them. Millie later visits Jamie's house to apologize and Jamie offers her some water, which she drinks. In the ensuing conversation, she begins to open up about some of the problems she and Tim have been facing in their relationship. Jamie relates Aristophanes' theory of the nature and origin of eros and encourages her not to let go of her \"other half\", then reminisces on his relationship with his seemingly deceased husband. Millie abruptly leaves after spotting a disoriented Tim outside.\nUsing exif data from their social media photos, Tim discovers that Simon and Keri visited the same cave he and Millie fell into after noticing the same symbols surrounding the cave, and unsuccessfully tries to convince Millie that the two of them may suffer whatever fate Simon and Keri did. That night, both Tim and Millie are supernaturally drawn together, causing their bodies to contort in unnatural ways until their arms become fused (it can be assumed that the water given to Millie by Jamie is from the pool in the cave, explaining why Millie is now also affected). They manage to prevent further fusion after consuming Tim's pills in a panic before passing out. Tim awakens tied to a chair, where Millie saws through their fused limb. Millie decides to drive them to the hospital, but realizes she has left her keys at Jamie's house. Tim promises to wait for her while she retrieves them, but secretly returns to the cave and finds Simon and Keri partially fused together as a grotesque humanoid with the Simon half having been stabbed in the neck.\nMillie enters Jamie's house and finds a TV playing the wedding tape of two men she does not recognize, then a video depicting a ritual in which the men fuse together. Jamie, revealed to be the result of said fusion, promises that they are happier after \"becoming whole\" and implores Millie to complete the fusion process with Tim. When she resists, he cuts her arm the same way his constituents had their arms cut in the tape before she escapes.\nMillie reunites with Tim in their driveway. He mentions the creature he saw in the cave, deducing that it was a result of both parties resisting the fusion process, resulting in the Simon half having been killed mid-fusion, and proclaiming he does not want to end up like them. He prepares to commit suicide by slitting his throat to save Millie, despite her pleading with him not to. Her wound from Jamie nearly causes her to fatally bleed out, but Tim saves her by fusing his arm to her wound. Accepting their fate, the two affirm their mutual love and slow dance to \"2 Become 1\", embracing as they fuse into a singular being.\nThat weekend, Millie's parents arrive for a visit. They knock on the door — now adorned with the symbol from the cave — and are greeted by a seemingly normal, androgynous person, suggesting that Millie and Tim had completed the fusion process.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nDave Franco as Tim Brassington\nAlison Brie as Millie Wilson\nDamon Herriman as Jamie McCabe\nMia Morrissey as Cath\nKarl Richmond as Jordy\nJack Kenny as Luke\nFrancesca Waters as Carol\nAljin Abella as Dr. Mendoza\nSarah Lang as Keri\nRob Brown as Chaplain\nEllora Iris as Anna\nCharlie Lees as Groom 1\nMJ Dorning as Groom 2\nTom Considine as Millie's father\nMelanie Beddie as Millie's mother\nFlynn Wandin as a Student\nNancy Finn as Tim's mother\nMark Robinson as Tim's father\nMichael Shanks as Simon\nSunny S. Walia as a Farmer\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development and casting ===\n\nIn February 2024, Dave Franco and Alison Brie joined the cast of the film, with Michael Shanks directing from a screenplay he wrote. 30West, Tango Entertainment and Picturestart produced and financed the film.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nThough the film is set in Washington state, principal photography took place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The film was shot in 21 days. Shanks's partner, who worked for a sex toy company, supplied free lifelike prop genitalia for use in a scene in which Brie and Franco's genitalia are stuck together. For a section of the movie Brie and Franco wore a prosthetic that effectively conjoined their arms together for hours on end, resulting in the couple having to use the restroom together.\nThe conjoining effects involved both prosthetics built by designer Larry Van Duynhoven and computer-generated imagery provided by Framestore. To create the merged version of Tim and Millie who the crew nicknamed \"Tillie\", effects supervisor Genevieve Camilleri went doing composites of Brie and Franco on Nuke to unveil a face that could be identified as an amalgation of the couple. With that as reference, Brie was filmed wearing a wig, a make-up recreation of Franco's eyebrows, and brown contacts. Afterwards Franco with motion tracking dots in his face was filmed on the same location, and his jaw and lips were digitally composited onto Brie's face.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe film score was conceived by Australian composer Cornel Wilczek, and was released on August 1, 2025, through Lakeshore Records. In an interview, Wilczek explained that the score is \"built around their romance\" while further stating, \"If you strip it all back, the main theme is basically a soppy love song. That became the raw material I bent, stretched, distorted, and reshaped throughout the film—mirroring those physical transformations. You've got elements courting each other, circling, slowly converging. There's a playfulness, but also tension and release. The music evolves alongside them.\" Additional songs featured in the film include \"2 Become 1\" by Spice Girls, \"Another One\" by Golden Suits, and \"Happy Together\" by The Turtles.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\n\n== Release ==\n\nThe film premiered in the Midnight section of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2025. Positive word-of-mouth following its premiere sparked much interest among companies including A24, Neon, Apple TV+, Focus Features, Searchlight Pictures, Mubi, and Amazon MGM Studios. Neon subsequently acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for $17 million, the first major sale at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. It had its international premiere on the opening night of the Sydney Film Festival on June 4, 2025, also screening in the Official Competition section of the festival on June 7 and 8.\nTogether was scheduled for a theatrical release in the United States on August 1, 2025. It was later moved up by two days to release on July 30. The film was released in Australia by Kismet Movies on July 31.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nTogether was released on digital platforms on August 26, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of September 1, 2025, Together has grossed $21.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $28.2 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, Together was released alongside The Bad Guys 2 and The Naked Gun, and was projected to gross $7.5–10 million in its opening weekend.  It went on to debut to $10.9 million, finishing sixth at the box office.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 219 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Given an extra sinew of authenticity by the metatextual casting of Alison Brie and Dave Franco at the top of their game, Together is a body horror that's as emotionally sticky as it is memorably gnarly.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nThe Globe and Mail's Barry Hertz gave a positive review and wrote, \"It is the most potent fusion of the pair's private and public lives any curious fan could possibly hope for. Oh, and it is exceptionally, wildly disgusting.\" Brianna Zigler of The A.V. Club gave the film a B grade, and wrote, \"The profound depth of feeling generated by Brie and Franco in the midst of this genre film, one perhaps unattainable if they weren't also married in real life, gives Together a real shot as the greatest romance of the year, even if it's also a film that happens to feature a motorized, saw-toothed blade slicing through mutated flesh. It takes more than gore to undermine the sensation of being so in love with someone that you want to get inside their skin.\" Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Nothing about Together screams comedy, yet that's precisely how it's put together.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal's Zachary Barnes gave a less positive review, stating, \"Together is less a fully conceived horror movie than a plodding relationship drama with some impressively disgusting effects superimposed on it.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Plagiarism lawsuit ==\nIn May 2025, Shanks, Brie, Franco, the talent agency Endeavor, and Neon were sued in a lawsuit alleging copyright infringement on the 2023 film Better Half by writer-director Patrick Henry Phelan; their production company StudioFest was the plaintiff in the suit. According to the filing, Better Half was pitched to Brie and Franco in August 2020, who rejected an offer to star because they wanted to produce it themselves and have William Morris Endeavor hire a writer for the material; claims on supposed similarities between the two films were also made. Shanks denied the allegations, stating that he wrote and registered the first draft of his screenplay to the Writers Guild of America in 2019, received development funding from Screen Australia in 2020 and that his agent pitched Franco with his script.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nTogether at IMDb",

        "title": "2025–26 UEFA Champions League",
        "content": "The 2025–26 UEFA Champions League is the 71st season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 34th season since it was rebranded from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League. Paris Saint-Germain are the defending champions, having secured their maiden title the previous season.\nThe final will be played on 30 May 2026 at Puskás Aréna in Budapest, Hungary. It will be the first time Puskás Aréna will host a Champions League final. The stadium previously hosted the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, several matches of UEFA Euro 2020, and the 2023 UEFA Europa League final. The winners of the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2026–27 UEFA Champions League league phase, the 2026 FIFA Intercontinental Cup finals, the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup group stage, and earn the right to play against the winners of the 2025–26 UEFA Europa League in the 2026 UEFA Super Cup.\nThis is the first Champions League season to feature six clubs from one nation, with England earning an extra spot through UEFA coefficient ranking and Tottenham Hotspur having won the previous season's Europa League.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\nA total of 82 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations are set to participate in the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein which does not organise a domestic league and Russia which is currently suspended). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\n\nAssociations 1–5 each have four teams.\nAssociation 6 has three teams.\nAssociations 7–15 each have two teams.\nAssociations 16–55 (except Liechtenstein and Russia) each have one team.\nThe winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League and 2024–25 UEFA Europa League are each given an additional entry if they do not qualify for the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league.\nThe two associations with the best coefficients in the 2024–25 season will each have one European Performance Spot into the league phase. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and Europa League cannot fill the European Performance Spots.\n\n\n=== Association ranking ===\nFor the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2024 UEFA association coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2019–20 to 2023–24. The table reflects Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA.\nApart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations may have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\n\n(EPS) – European Performance Spot, the additional berths for associations who finish in the top 2 of the 2024–25 association coefficients\n(TH) – Additional berth for UEFA Champions League title holders\n(EL) – Additional berth for UEFA Europa League title holders\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\n\nThe information here reflects the ongoing suspension of Russia in European football, and so the following changes to the default access list have been made:\n\nThe champions of associations 23 (Cyprus) and 24 (Hungary) will enter the second qualifying round (Champions Path) instead of the first qualifying round.\nAs the Champions League title holders (Paris Saint-Germain) qualified via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list have been made:\n\nOlympiacos as the club with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the Champions Path of the qualifying phase or play-off round, will enter the league phase instead of the Champions Path second qualifying round.\nSlovan Bratislava and Qarabağ, as the two clubs with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the Champions Path first qualifying round, will enter the Champions Path second qualifying round.\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:\n\nTH: Champions League title holders\nEL: Europa League title holders\n1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.: League positions of the previous season\nEPS: European Performance Spots – the additional berths given to clubs from the two associations with the highest coefficient points in 2024–25\nThe label of European Performance Spots and title holders already qualified via league position are superscripted.\nThe second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round are divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP).\n\n\n== Round and draw dates ==\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows. One \"exclusive week\" will be held in which Thursday will also be a matchday. All matches in other weeks will be played on Tuesdays and Wednesdays apart from Matchday 8 (Wednesday only) and the final.\n\n\n== Qualifying rounds ==\n\n\n=== First qualifying round ===\nThe draw for the first qualifying round was held on 17 June 2025.\nThe first legs were played on 8 and 9 July, and the second legs were played on 15 and 16 July 2025.\nThe winners of the ties advanced to the Champions Path second qualifying round. Twelve of the losing teams were transferred to the Conference League Champions Path second qualifying round, and the other two losing teams (selected via a draw) were transferred to the Conference League Champions Path third qualifying round.\n\n\n=== Second qualifying round ===\nThe draw for the second qualifying round was held on 18 June 2025.\nThe first legs were played on 22 and 23 July, and the second legs were played on 29 and 30 July 2025.\nThe winners of the ties advanced to the third qualifying round. The losers were transferred to the Europa League third qualifying round.\n\n\n=== Third qualifying round ===\nThe draw for the third qualifying round was held on 21 July 2025.\nThe first legs were played on 5 and 6 August, and the second legs were played on 12 August 2025.\nThe winners of the ties advanced to the play-off round. The losers of the Champions Path were transferred to the Europa League play-off round. The losers of the League Path were transferred to the Europa League league phase.\n\n\n== Play-off round ==\n\nThe draw for the play-off round was held on 4 August 2025.\nThe first legs were played on 19 and 20 August, and the second legs were played on 26 and 27 August 2025.\nThe winners of the ties advanced to the league phase. The losers were transferred to the Europa League league phase.\n\n\n== League phase ==\n\nThe league phase draw for the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League took place at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 28 August 2025. The 36 teams were divided into four pots of nine teams each based on their UEFA club coefficient, except for the Champions League title holders, who were automatically placed as the top seed in pot 1.\nThe 36 teams were manually drawn and then automated software drew their eight different opponents at random, determining which of their matches are at home and which ones away. Each team faces two opponents from each of the four pots, one at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association.\nBodø/Glimt, Kairat, Pafos and Union Saint-Gilloise will make their debut appearances in the league phase/group stage.  Kairat, based in Almaty, became the easternmost team to ever qualify for the Champions League proper, and, after being drawn to play away against Sporting CP, will break the record for the longest trip in UEFA competitions, travelling approximately 7200km from Almaty to Lisbon, taking into account that the Portuguese authorities banned incoming flights that travel through Russian airspace, a measure taken due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In addition, Bodø/Glimt, based in Bodø within the Arctic Circle, became the northernmost European team to ever compete in the Champions League. This marks the first time a Norwegian team has participated in the competition proper since the 2007–08 season, and will also be the first season since 2005–06 in which no Ukrainian sides qualified for the group stage/league phase.\nA total of 16 national associations will be represented in the league phase.\n\n\n=== Table ===\nThe top eight ranked teams will receive a bye to the round of 16. The teams ranked from 9th to 24th will contest the knockout phase play-offs, with the teams ranked from 9th to 16th seeded for the draw. Teams ranked from 25th to 36th will be eliminated from all competitions, with no access to the 2025–26 UEFA Europa League.\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n2025–26 UEFA Europa League\n2025–26 UEFA Conference League\n2026 UEFA Super Cup\n2025–26 UEFA Women's Champions League\n2025–26 UEFA Women's Europa Cup\n2025–26 UEFA Youth League\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "title": "Lee Majors",
        "content": "Lee Majors (born Harvey Lee Yeary; April 23, 1939) is an American actor. He portrayed the characters of Heath Barkley on the American television Western series The Big Valley (1965–1969), Colonel Steve Austin on the American television science-fiction action series The Six Million Dollar Man (1973–1978), and Colt Seavers on the American television action series The Fall Guy (1981–1986).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMajors was born in Wyandotte, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit to Carl and Alice Yeary. His father died in a work accident five months prior to his birth, and his mother was killed in a car accident when he was almost seventeen months old. At the age of two, Majors was adopted by his uncle and aunt, Harvey and Mildred Yeary, and he moved with them to Middlesboro, Kentucky.\nMajors participated in track and football at Middlesboro High School. He graduated in 1957, and played football at Indiana University in 1957–1958. Majors transferred to Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, Kentucky in 1959. He played in his first football game the following year, but suffered a severe back injury which left him paralyzed for two weeks and ruined his college athletic career. Following his injury, he turned his attention to acting and performed in plays at the Pioneer Playhouse in Danville, Kentucky. Majors graduated from Eastern Kentucky in 1962 with a degree in history and physical education. He planned to be a football coach.\nAfter college, he received an offer to try out for the St. Louis Cardinals football team. Instead, he moved to Los Angeles and found work at the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department as the recreation director at the North Hollywood Park. In Los Angeles, Majors met many actors and industry professionals, including Dick Clayton, who had been James Dean's agent, and Clayton suggested he attend his acting school. After one year of acting school, Clayton felt that Majors was ready to start his career. At this time, he picked up the stage name Lee Majors as a tribute to childhood hero Johnny Majors who was a player and future coach for the University of Tennessee. Majors also studied at Estelle Harman's acting school at MGM.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early roles ===\nMajors landed his first, although uncredited, role in Strait-Jacket (1964), in a flashback sequence as Joan Crawford's cheating husband. After appearing in a 1965 episode of Gunsmoke, he starred later that year as Howard White in an episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, \"The Monkey's Paw – A Retelling\", based on the short story by W. W. Jacobs.\nMajors got his big break when he was chosen out of over 400 young actors, including Burt Reynolds, for the co-starring role of Heath Barkley in a new ABC/ Four Star Western series, The Big Valley, which starred Barbara Stanwyck. Also starring on the show was another newcomer, Linda Evans, who played Heath's younger sister, Audra. Richard Long and Peter Breck, (who himself had previously starred in Black Saddle for Four Star) played his brothers Jarrod and Nick, respectively. One of Heath's frequently used expressions during the series was \"Boy howdy!\" During the series, Majors co-starred in the 1968 Charlton Heston film Will Penny, for which he received an \"Introducing\" credit, and landed the lead role in The Ballad of Andy Crocker (1969), a made-for-television film which was first broadcast by ABC. The film was one of the first films to deal with the subject matter of Vietnam veterans \"coming home\". That same year, he was offered the chance to star in Midnight Cowboy (1969), but when The Big Valley was renewed, he declined the role (which later went to Jon Voight). When The Big Valley was cancelled in 1969, he signed a long-term contract with Universal Studios. In 1970, Majors appeared in William Wyler's final film The Liberation of L.B. Jones, and joined the cast of The Virginian for its final season when the show was restructured as The Men from Shiloh featuring four alternating leads. Majors played new ranch hand Roy Tate.\nMajors was called a \"blond Elvis Presley\" because of his resemblance to Elvis during this period of his career.\n\n\n=== 1970s: The Six Million Dollar Man ===\n\nIn 1971, he landed the role of Arthur Hill's partner, Jess Brandon, on Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law, which garnered critical acclaim during its three seasons on ABC.\nMajors's co-starring role on Owen Marshall led him to a starring role as United States Air Force Colonel Steve Austin, an ex-astronaut with bionic implants in The Six Million Dollar Man, a 1973 television film broadcast on ABC. In 1974, the network decided to turn it into a weekly series. The series became an international success, being screened in over 71 countries, turning Majors into a pop icon. Majors also made his directorial debut in 1975, on an episode called \"One of Our Running Backs Is Missing\" which co-starred professional football players such as Larry Csonka and Dick Butkus.\nIn 1977, with The Six Million Dollar Man still a hit series, Majors tried to renegotiate his contract with Universal Television. The studio in turn filed a lawsuit to force him to report to work due to stipulations within his existing contract that had not yet expired. It was rumored that Majors was holding out for more money, but his manager denied this: according to him, Majors was fighting to have his own production company, Fawcett Majors Productions, brought on as an independent producer in association with Universal in order to make the company viable. After Majors did not report to work that June, studio executives ultimately relented. However, ratings began to decline and The Six Million Dollar Man was cancelled on ABC in 1978. The companion show, The Bionic Woman, was also cancelled at around the same time on NBC.\nThe Six Million Dollar Man was revived for three TV movies in the 1980s. In November 2010, Time-Life released a 40-DVD set featuring every episode and bonus features from the show.\nDuring the 1970s, while working on The Six Million Dollar Man, Majors also appeared in various movies: the television film Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident (1976, as Francis Gary Powers), the Viking film The Norseman (1978) co-starring Cornel Wilde, the horror thriller Killer Fish (1979), and the drama  Steel (1979), which he produced, co-starring Jennifer O'Neill and Art Carney.\n\n\n=== 1980s: The Fall Guy ===\nIn 1981, Majors returned in another long-running television series. Producer Glen A. Larson (who had first worked with Majors on Alias Smith and Jones, in which Majors guest starred, and later on The Six Million Dollar Man) asked him to star in The Fall Guy. Majors played Colt Seavers, a Hollywood stuntman who moonlights as a bounty hunter. Majors also sang its theme song, the self-effacing The Unknown Stuntman. The show was a hit, and as one of the producers, Majors invited many of his former co-stars, including Linda Evans, Peter Breck, Lindsay Wagner, Richard Anderson, Stewart Granger, Doug McClure, James Drury, and Buddy Hackett to appear in various episodes. The series ran for five seasons and ended in 1986.\nHis 1980s films include the political thriller Agency (1980), starring Robert Mitchum, the made-for-TV sequel High Noon, Part II: The Return of Will Kane (1980), playing Gary Cooper's original role, the science fiction film The Last Chase (1981), and the disaster film Starflight: The Plane That Couldn't Land (1983). Majors also made cameo appearances in Circle of Two (1980), and as himself in the 1988 holiday comedy Scrooged.\nBetween 1987 and 1994, Majors, with co-stars Lindsay Wagner and Richard Anderson, made three The Six Million Dollar Man/The Bionic Woman television films.\n\n\n=== 1990s–present ===\n\nIn 1990, he starred in the film Keaton's Cop, and had recurring roles in Tour of Duty and the short-lived 1992 series, Raven. He also had supporting roles in the films Trojan War (1997), Out Cold (2001), Big Fat Liar (2002), and The Brothers Solomon (2007). He voiced the character of \"Big\" Mitch Baker in the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. He played Jaret Reddick's disconnected father in Bowling For Soup's 2007 video, \"When We Die\". That same year, he played Grandpa Max in Ben 10: Race Against Time, and voiced a character on the APTN animated children's program Wapos Bay: The Series that was named \"Steve from Austin\".\nMajors played Coach Ross on the CW Network television series The Game, which ran from October 1, 2006, to May 20, 2009.\nMajors appeared in the role of God in \"Jim Almighty\", a 2008 episode of According to Jim. He later returned to the role in that show's 2009 series finale, \"Heaven Opposed to Hell\". Also in 2008, Majors played a member of the Minutemen (dedicated to preventing illegal border crossings) in season four of the Showtime series Weeds, where he recruits Kevin Nealon's character. Majors reprised his role (voice only) as Col. Steve Austin in the \"Bionic Woman\" segment of the Robot Chicken season four episode \"Love, Maurice\" (2009).\nIn March 2010, Majors played the crusty sailing instructor in the Community episode \"Beginner Pottery\". In April 2010, he appeared as the mentor of the series lead in \"Christopher Chance\", the 12th episode of Human Target. Later that year, he provided the voice of General Abernathy in G.I. Joe: Renegades. He later reprised the role in a 2011 episode. In 2011, he appeared as \"Rockwell\" in Jerusalem Countdown. From 2011 to 2014 he appeared in three episodes of the Fox comedy Raising Hope, as Burt's father, Ralph. On February 1, 2013, it was announced that Majors would appear in a two-episode guest spot in season two of TNT's Dallas as Ken Richards, an old flame of Sue Ellen's. In 2015, he appeared as J.D. in the faith-based drama Do You Believe? and the hip-hop dance-themed series Avengers of eXtreme Illusions. Majors appeared in the second and third seasons of Ash vs Evil Dead as Brock Williams, the father of Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell). In late 2018, Majors voiced an animated Six Million Dollar Man action figure in an advertisement for Honda's \"Happy Honda Days\" sale event. In 2019, Majors voiced Jeff Tracy in Thunderbirds Are Go. In 2024, Majors reunited with Heather Thomas, his co-star from The Fall Guy TV series, for cameo appearances in the movie version of The Fall Guy, in which Ryan Gosling played Majors' TV series character Colt Seavers.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Marriages ===\nKathy Robinson (married 1961, divorced 1964) – One child together, Lee Majors Jr. (born April 8, 1962), who later became an actor and appeared alongside his father on an episode of The Fall Guy and in all three Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman reunion telefilms, credited as Lee Majors II.\nFarrah Fawcett (married 1973, separated 1979, divorced 1982) – During the first six years of their marriage, she went by the name of Farrah Fawcett-Majors.

Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 39 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.\nIndia Today gave the film a 3.5 out of 5 star rating. The German film website film-datenbank.eu gave My Oxford Year 82 out of 100 points.\nBenjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film 2/5 stars, saying the film suffers from a lack of emotional depth and does not fully captivate its audience, resulting in a viewing experience that is just mediocre at best but ultimately forgettable.\nHoncques Laus, a scholar at the University of Oxford, critiques the film for its deficiencies in portraying the university's ceremonies and traditions. For instance, the film misconstrues the Master of Arts from Oxford as an academic degree, omits Classical Latin from the matriculation ceremony, misrepresents matriculation as a solitary journey, and mislocates the college ball. However, he acknowledges the accurate inclusion of the subfusc, the Sheldonian Theatre as the setting for ceremonies, and the use of DPhil as an abbreviation for Doctor of Philosophy at Oxford.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nSurprised by Oxford\n\n\n== External links ==\nMy Oxford Year on Netflix \nMy Oxford Year at IMDb",

        "title": "Big Brother 27 (American season)",
        "content": "Big Brother 27 is the twenty-seventh season of the American reality television program Big Brother. The program is an adaptation of the franchise created in 1999 by John de Mol. The season features a murder mystery hotel theme. It premiered on CBS on July 10, 2025, with filming beginning two days prior and running for 83 days, concluding on September 28, 2025. The season also celebrates the 25-year anniversary of the series as a whole.\n\n\n== Format ==\n\nBig Brother follows a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, who live inside a custom-built house outfitted with cameras and microphones that record them at all times. The HouseGuests are sequestered with no contact with the outside world. During their stay, the HouseGuests share their thoughts on their day-to-day lives inside the house in a private room known as the Diary Room. Each week, the HouseGuests compete to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in a Head of Household (HOH) competition. The winner of the HOH competition is immune from eviction and selects two (or, in certain seasons, three) HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. \nSix HouseGuests are then selected to compete in the Power of Veto (POV) competition: the reigning HOH, the nominees, and other players selected by random draw. The winner of the POV competition has the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or to leave them as-is. If the POV winner uses this power, the HOH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest, other than the POV winner, for eviction. \nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests vote to evict one of the nominees, though the HOH and the nominees are not allowed to vote. This vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. In the event of a tie, the HOH casts the tie-breaking vote. The last seven evicted HouseGuests comprise the jury and are sequestered in a separate location following their eviction. The jury is only allowed to see the competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests; they are not shown any interviews or other footage that might include strategy or details regarding nominations. When there are only two remaining HouseGuests, the jury will vote for the season's winner, who receives a grand prize of $750,000. The viewing public awards an additional prize by choosing \"America's Favorite HouseGuest\", with the award being worth $50,000. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntarily leave or are forcibly removed for rule violations.\n\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n\nThe initial cast of sixteen contestants was revealed on July 8, 2025. An additional seventeenth contestant was teased prior to the beginning of the season. During the premiere, this was revealed to be season 12 HouseGuest and season 13 winner Rachel Reilly.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n== Voting history ==\nColor key:\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nOn May 14, 2025, CBS announced that Big Brother 27 would premiere on July 10, 2025. Promos for the season suggested an overall theme related to secrets and mysteries, with television commercials featuring whispered conversations, and a promotional image of host Julie Chen Moonves posing with a wall of skeleton keys described as being able to \"[unlock] unexpected mysteries in the Big Brother house\". Filming began on July 8, 2025. \nThe theme for Big Brother 27 was ultimately revealed to be \"A Summer of Mystery\", with the house being re-themed as the \"Hotel Mystère\". The A.I. Arena twist from the previous season was revived as the \"BB Block Buster\"; as before, the HoH picks three nominees for eviction instead of two, with the three nominees then competing in a challenge for a chance to be saved from eviction.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Broadcast ===\nThe season premiered on CBS on July 10, 2025. Thereafter, new episodes are set to air on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 8:00 p.m. eastern time (ET), with Wednesday night episodes lasting 90 minutes long. A new companion show—Big Brother: Unlocked—will air bi-weekly on Fridays beginning July 25; the show will feature additional footage and behind the scenes content, interviews, and guest analysis from alumni of past seasons.\n\n\n=== Streaming ===\nFollowing their broadcast, new episodes stream on Paramount+ and CBS On Demand. As with previous seasons, Paramount+ is also providing access to 24/7 live feeds. The live feeds also stream on Pluto TV in a free advertisement-supported format.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Khamzat Chimaev",
        "content": "Khamzat Khizarovich Chimaev (born 1 May 1994) is a Russian-Emirati professional mixed martial artist and freestyle wrestler who currently competes in the Middleweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) where he is the current UFC Middleweight Champion. In freestyle wrestling, Chimaev is a three-time Swedish national champion. As of 19 August 2025, he is #4 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nChimaev was born on 1 May 1994 in Gvardeyskoye, Chechen Republic, Russia to a poor conservative Muslim Chechen family. He started wrestling at the age of five in the village of Gvardeyskoye. It has been reported he won a bronze medal at the Russian National Championships in the junior level. In 2013, when he was 18, he emigrated to Sweden with his mother, joining his older brother.\n\n\n== Combat sports career ==\n\n\n=== Wrestling ===\nAfter moving to Sweden, Chimaev wrestled at multiple clubs,  including BK Athén. Considered one of the best freestyle wrestlers in the country, Chimaev won a gold medal at the 2016 and 2017 Swedish Freestyle National Championships at 86 kilograms, and in 2018 he did so at 92 kilograms. Chimaev has had a series of dominant performances in the tournament, posting an overall record of 12–0, which includes three pins, seven technical falls and holds a combined score of 105 points, while only surrendering two himself, across all of his three showdowns. Chimaev has competed in a few judo tournaments and in four combat sambo fights.\nChimaev competed against fellow UFC contender Jack Hermansson in a freestyle wrestling match on 19 November 2021, at Sweden-based Bulldog Fight Night 9, winning on points.\n\n\n=== Mixed martial arts career ===\nChimaev first started training in MMA when he was 23 years old. He trained at Allstars Training Center in Stockholm, along with three-time UFC Light Heavyweight Championship challenger Alexander Gustafsson, Ilir Latifi and Reza Madadi among others. Gustafsson (one of his main training partners) told a Swedish reporter that Chimaev was one of the best fighters he had ever trained with, during a press conference in June 2019.\n\n\n==== Early career ====\nIn an interview with ESPN, Chimaev claimed he was inspired to start training in MMA during a night at work where he took a 15-minute break to watch the Aldo vs. McGregor main event. Chimaev stated, \"I was watching his [McGregor's] fight. I was watching him fight Aldo. I was sitting in night and was working. I was taking rest for 15 minutes and watched his fight. I always look at that like if the guys make so many money like millions and this stuff, why I can't do it now. I'm a fighter, I'm a warrior and I have something special inside me. I had to find some way and take out this to show to the people.\"\nBetween September 2017 and April 2018, Chimaev had three amateur MMA fights. The first of them was against future IMMAF World Champion Khaled Laallam, whom he defeated via submission in the second round. He won his following two amateur fights, one by submission and one by technical knockout, completing his amateur career with a record of 3–0.\nChimaev turned professional on 26 May 2018, at International Ring Fight Arena 14, against Gard Olve Sagen. He won the fight via technical knockout in the second round. Chimaev's next fight took place on 18 August 2018, against Ole Magnor at Fight Club Rush 3. He won via submission with a rear naked choke late in the first round.\n\n\n==== Brave Combat Federation ====\nAfter having his first two professional fights in Sweden, Chimaev signed with Middle Eastern organization Brave Combat Federation. He was scheduled to make his promotional debut against Benjamin Bennett on 16 November 2018, at Brave CF 18. However, Bennett withdrew from the bout and was replaced by undefeated prospect Marko Kisič. Chimaev won the fight via technical knockout in the first round after dropping his opponent with a left hand.\nChimaev had a quick turnaround for his next fight when he took on Sidney Wheeler on short notice on 22 December 2018, at Brave CF 20, replacing an injured Leon Aliu. He won the fight via technical knockout in 35 seconds into the first round.\nHe then fought Ikram Aliskerov on 19 April 2019, at Brave CF 23. This was Chimaev's debut in the welterweight division. He won the bout via knockout after landing an uppercut in the first round. This performance earned him Brave's Knockout of the Night award.\nHis fourth promotional fight came against Mzwandile Hlongwa on 4 October 2019, at Brave CF 27. Chimaev won the fight via submission in the second round.\nChimaev was expected to challenge Jarrah Al-Selawe for the BCF Welterweight Championship on 18 April 2020, at Brave CF 37, which would be the promotions first event in Chimaev's hometown of Stockholm, Sweden. However, the event would be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the matchup was cancelled altogether when Chimaev signed with the UFC instead.\n\n\n==== Ultimate Fighting Championship ====\nChimaev made his promotional debut in a middleweight bout against John Phillips, replacing Duško Todorović, on 16 July 2020, at UFC on ESPN 13. He won the fight via submission in the second round. This win earned him the Performance of the Night award.\nTen days after the fight against Phillips, Chimaev faced promotional newcomer Rhys McKee at welterweight on 25 July 2020, at UFC on ESPN 14. He won the fight via technical knockout in the first round. He earned his second Performance of the Night bonus award. This win also marked a new UFC record for the fastest consecutive wins in modern UFC history (ten days), although the official UFC record is still held by Royce Gracie, who achieved four consecutive wins within one night at UFC 2.\nIt was reported on 6 September 2020, that Chimaev would have another quick turnaround as he was booked to face Gerald Meerschaert on 19 September 2020, at UFC Fight Night 178. He won the fight against Meerschaert via knockout just 17 seconds into round one. This win earned him his third straight Performance of the Night award.

In between, Chimaev was added to the UFC welterweight rankings, entering at #15.

On 1 December, Edwards also tested positive for COVID-19 and the bout was subsequently postponed. On 22 December, it was announced that the bout was rescheduled for 20 January 2021, at UFC Fight Night 185. Subsequently, Chimaev pulled out of the contest on 29 December due to his own COVID-19 recovery. As a result, the bout was momentarily cancelled. The pair was rescheduled once again to headline UFC Fight Night 187, on 13 March. However, on 11 February, UFC president Dana White announced the fight was once again cancelled due to Chimaev suffering from lingering effects of COVID-19.\nOn 1 March 2021, he announced on Instagram that he was retiring from the sport due to lung complications caused by COVID-19. Dana White later came out and said Chimaev was not retired and was just emotional after experiencing effects of prednisone for his lungs during a training session.\nChimaev returned to face Li Jingliang on 30 October 2021, at UFC 267. He won the bout via technical submission, choking Li unconscious with a rear-naked choke in round one. This win earned him his fourth straight Performance of the Night award.\nChimaev faced Gilbert Burns at UFC 273 on 9 April 2022. Chimaev won the fight via unanimous decision, the first decision victory of his career. The fight was awarded the Fight of the Night award. The fight also earned him first place in the Crypto.com Fan Bonus of the Night award.\nChimaev was scheduled to face Nate Diaz on 10 September 2022 in the main event of UFC 279. At the weigh-ins, Chimaev weighed in at 178.5 pounds, seven and a half pounds over the welterweight non-title fight limit. As a result of missing weight, Chimaev was removed from his main event bout with Diaz, and instead faced Kevin Holland in the co-main event at a 180-pound catchweight bout. Holland was already set for a 180-pound catchweight bout against Daniel Rodriguez on the card. Chimaev won the bout via D'Arce Choke in the first round.\nAfter a one-year layoff, Chimaev returned to middleweight on 21 October 2023, at UFC 294. Chimaev was originally scheduled to fight former middleweight title challenger Paulo Costa. However, due to surgery forcing Costa to pull out of the fight, Chimaev faced former UFC Welterweight Champion Kamaru Usman. He won the fight via majority decision.\nChimaev was scheduled to face former UFC Middleweight Champion Robert Whittaker on 22 June 2024, at UFC on ABC 6. However, he was forced to pull out of the contest due to an illness and was replaced by Ikram Aliskerov.\nChimaev ended up facing Robert Whittaker on 26 October 2024 at UFC 308. He won the fight via a face-crank submission in the first round resulting in a dislocated jaw. This fight earned him another Performance of the Night award.\n\n\n===== UFC Middleweight Champion =====\nChimaev faced Dricus du Plessis for the UFC Middleweight Championship on 16 August 2025 at UFC 319. He won the title via unanimous decision. This win earned Chimaev his sixth Performance of the Night award.\n\n\n== Training ==\nChimaev has trained at Allstar Training Center in Stockholm, Sweden since he was 23 years of age. He moved there to start his MMA career in 2017, after previously living in another Swedish town, Kalmar, where he trained at the local wrestling club. Chimaev continues to train alongside current and former UFC fighters such as Alexander Gustafsson, Ilir Latifi and Reza Madadi, with the latter being his main trainer.\nIn 2022, Chimaev and UFC title challenger Darren Till got in contact to train with each other, with Till arriving to Stockholm in February, and have since been training at Allstars Training Center and shooting content for YouTube and Blockasset.\nIn an interview, Chimaev revealed he trains up to five times a day on the peak of training camps, and two to three times when he has no fights coming up.\n\n\n== Fighting style ==\nChimaev often utilizes his freestyle wrestling in his fights to get his opponents to the ground. Once he is on top control, he employs different techniques to gain control over his opponents and land heavy ground-and-pound or seek submissions, while forcing his weight towards them. His grappling is very often compared to Khabib Nurmagomedov's, due to the similarities of the techniques, such as the handcuff lock and hooking the legs. Regarding strikes, Chimaev landed 192–2 in his first two UFC bouts utilizing this strategy. Chimaev also proved its effectiveness on the regional circuit as well, with a quick win over former two-time GHSA wrestling champion Sidney Wheeler after taking him down with an  outside trip.\nIn addition to his grappling abilities, Chimaev will also strike in his contests. Although his striking is still relatively unknown and untested, it involves heavy knockout power from the orthodox stance while utilizing basic boxing and mixing up kicks. He also uses his wrestling to set up his strikes by feinting different takedowns and vice versa. By using his striking, Chimaev has been able to knock out UFC veteran Gerald Meerschaert  in 17 seconds with a single punch. He has previously used it to drop past opponents on the regional circuit, including former combat sambo World Champion Ikram Aliskerov.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKhamzat carries a notable scar on his lip, which he got at the age of two when he fell down on concrete stairs, leaving him unable to breathe correctly through one nostril.\nBefore he began competing professionally, he worked at a poultry factory in Kalmar and also did security work.\nKhamzat has an older brother named Artur, who competes in freestyle wrestling.\nChimaev contracted COVID-19 in December 2020 and suffered lingering symptoms that required multiple hospitalizations and the cancelation of a scheduled fight against Leon Edwards.\nChimaev is close with fellow mixed martial artists Darren Till and Jack Hermansson.\nDespite living in Sweden for many years, Chimaev never acquired a Swedish citizenship, keeping his Russian citizenship. In 2023, Chimaev moved to the UAE, and later received citizenship in January 2025. He is the first athlete representing the United Arab Emirates to win a UFC title. \n\n\n=== Association with Ramzan Kadyrov ===\nChimaev is close to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov gifted Chimaev a Mercedes-Benz, which he crashed months later. Kadyrov also allegedly convinced Chimaev to not retire in March 2021 and go back to Chechnya, which led to speculation on the media on whether Chimaev had been forced to do so. Chimaev has sparred with Kadyrov, and appeared in multiple photoshoots with Kadyrov. In 2022, Chimaev began training Kadyrov's two teenage sons, Zelimkhan (Ali) and Adam. He was in Ali's corner at his professional MMA debut at ACA 150 in December, accompanied him to UFC 280 in Abu Dhabi, and took him to train to Tiger Muay Thai in Thailand.\nChimaev was present during a livestream in which Kadyrov threatened to kill a minor who criticized his repressive rule. In March 2022, Chechen dissidents criticized Chimaev's continued association with Kadyrov due to his repressive rule of the Chechen Republic.\nChimaev got married on 21 May 2022, in Chechnya and the wedding was attended by Kadyrov.\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\n\n\n=== Mixed martial arts ===\nUltimate Fighting Championship\nUFC Middleweight Championship (One time, Current)\nTied (Demetrious Johnson) for third most takedowns landed in a UFC title fight (12 vs. Dricus du Plessis)\nFirst Chechen-born fighter to win a UFC championship\nFight of the Night (One time) vs. Gilbert Burns\nPerformance of the Night (Six times) vs. John Phillips, Rhys McKee, Gerald Meerschaert, Li Jingliang, Robert Whittaker and Dricus du Plessis\nRecord for fastest consecutive wins in Modern UFC history (10 days)\nRecord for quickest three fight win streak in Modern UFC history (66 days)\nSecond most control time in a UFC fight (21:40 vs. Dricus du Plessis)\nSecond most takedowns landed in a UFC middleweight fight (12 vs. Dricus du Plessis)\nHolds wins over three former UFC champions —  vs. Kamaru Usman, Robert Whittaker & Dricus du Plessis\nUFC Striking Records\nMost total strikes landed in a UFC fight (529 vs. Dricus du Plessis)\nMost total ground strikes landed in a UFC fight (517 vs. Dricus du Plessis)\nMost total head strikes landed in a UFC fight (411 vs. Dricus du Plessis)\nSecond most total strikes attempted in a UFC fight (567 vs. Dricus du Plessis)\n\nUFC Honors Awards\n2020: Fan's Choice Debut of the Year Winner vs. John Phillips\n2021: Fan's Choice Submission of the Year Nominee vs. Li Jingliang\n2022: President's Choice Fight of the Year Winner vs. Gilbert Burns\n2024: President's Choice Performance of the Year Nominee vs. Robert Whittaker\nUFC.com Awards\n2020: Newcomer of the Year, Ranked #5 Fighter of the Year & Ranked #5 Knockout of the Year vs. Gerald Meerschaert\n2021: Ranked #9 Submission of the Year vs. Li Jingliang\n2022: Ranked #2 Fight of the Year vs. Gilbert Burns\n2024: Submission of the Year vs. Robert Whittaker\nCrypto.com\nFan Bonus of the Night vs. Gilbert Burns\nBrave Combat Federation\nKnockout of the Night (One time) vs. Ikram Aliskerov\nNordic MMA Awards – MMAviking.com\n2018 Prospect of the Year\n2020 Male fighter of the Year\nMMAjunkie.com\n2020 September Knockout of the Month vs. Gerald Meerschaert\n2020 Newcomer of the Year\nMMA Fighting\n2020 \"Breakout Fighter of the Year\"\nCombatPress.com\n2020 \"Breakthrough Fighter of the Year\"\nBT Sport\n2020 Breakthrough Fighter of the Year\nBodySlam.net\n2024 Submission of the Year vs. Robert Whittaker\nYahoo!

Born and raised in New York City, Epstein began his professional career as a teacher at the Dalton School. After his dismissal from the school in 1976, he entered the banking and finance sector, working at Bear Stearns in various roles before starting his own firm. Epstein cultivated an elite social circle and procured many women and children whom he and his associates sexually abused.\nIn 2005, police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein after a parent reported that he had sexually abused her 14-year-old daughter. Federal officials identified 36 girls, some as young as 14 years old, whom Epstein had allegedly sexually abused. Epstein pleaded guilty and was convicted in 2008 by a Florida state court of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute. He was convicted of only these two crimes as part of a controversial plea deal agreed by the US Department of Justice's Alex Acosta, and served almost 13 months in custody but with extensive work release.\nEpstein was arrested again on July 6, 2019, on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors in Florida and New York. He died in his jail cell on August 10, 2019. The medical examiner ruled that his death was a suicide by hanging. Epstein's lawyers have disputed the ruling, and there has been significant public skepticism about the true cause of his death, resulting in numerous conspiracy theories. In July 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released CCTV footage supporting the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell. However, when the Department of Justice released the footage, approximately 2 minutes and 53 seconds of it was missing, and the video was found to have been modified despite the FBI's claim that it was raw.\nSince Epstein's death precluded the possibility of pursuing criminal charges against him, a judge dismissed all criminal charges on August 29, 2019. Epstein had a decades-long association with the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who recruited young girls for him, leading to her 2021 conviction on US federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy for helping him procure girls, including a 14-year-old, for child sexual abuse and prostitution. His friendship with public figures including Prince Andrew, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway, has attracted significant controversy. Steven Hoffenberg, who spent 18 years behind bars as byproduct of his association with Epstein, in 2020 characterized the man as a \"master manipulator\".\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJeffrey Edward Epstein was born on January 20, 1953, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His parents, Pauline \"Paula\" Stolofsky (1918–2004) and Seymour George Epstein (1916–1991), were Jewish and had married in 1952 shortly before his birth. Pauline worked as a school aide and was a homemaker. \"Paula was a wonderful mother and homemaker, despite the fact that she had a full-time job\", according to a former childhood friend of Epstein's. Seymour worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation as a groundskeeper and gardener. Jeffrey was the older of two siblings; he and his brother Mark grew up in the working-class neighborhood of Sea Gate, a private gated community in Coney Island, Brooklyn. Epstein was referred to as \"Bear\" by his parents while Mark was known as \"Puggie\". Neighbors described the Epstein family as being, \"so gentle, the most gentle people\".\nEpstein attended local public schools, first attending Public School 188, and then Mark Twain Junior High School nearby and usually earned money by tutoring classmates. Acquaintances considered Epstein \"sweet and generous\", although \"quiet and nerdy\", and nicknamed him \"Eppy\". \"He was just an average boy, very smart in math, slightly overweight, freckles, always smiling\", a female friend later said.\nIn 1967, Epstein attended the National Music Camp at the Interlochen Center for the Arts. He began playing the piano when he was five, and was regarded as a talented musician by friends. He graduated in 1969 from Lafayette High School at age 16, having skipped two grades. Later that year, he attended advanced math classes at Cooper Union until he changed colleges in 1971. From September 1971, he attended the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University studying mathematical physiology, but left without receiving a degree in June 1974.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Private school teacher (1974–1976) ===\nAt age 21, Epstein started working in September 1974 as a physics and mathematics teacher for teens at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Donald Barr, who served as the headmaster until June 1974, was known to have made several unconventional recruitments at the time, although it is unclear whether he had a direct role in hiring Epstein. Three months after Barr's departure, Epstein began to teach at the school, despite his lack of credentials.\nEpstein allegedly showed inappropriate behavior toward underage female students at the time, paying them constant attention, and even showing up at a party where young people were drinking, according to a former student. Other former students also often saw him flirting with female students. Eventually, Epstein became acquainted with Alan Greenberg, the chief executive officer of Bear Stearns, whose son and daughter were attending the school. Greenberg's daughter, Lynne Koeppel, pointed to a parent-teacher conference where Epstein influenced another Dalton parent into advocating for him to Greenberg. In June 1976, after Epstein was dismissed from Dalton for \"poor performance\", Greenberg offered him a job at Bear Stearns.\n\n\n=== Bear Stearns (1976–1981) ===\n\nEpstein joined Bear Stearns in 1976 as a low-level junior assistant to a floor trader. He swiftly moved up to become an options trader, working in the special products division, and then advised the bank's wealthiest clients, such as Seagram president Edgar Bronfman, on tax mitigation strategies. Jimmy Cayne, the bank's later chief executive officer, praised Epstein's skill with wealthy clients and complex products. In 1980, four years after joining Bear Stearns, Epstein became a limited partner. In 1981, Epstein was asked to leave Bear Stearns for, according to his sworn testimony, being guilty of a \"Reg D violation\". Even though Epstein departed abruptly, he remained close to Cayne and Greenberg and was a client of Bear Stearns until its collapse in 2008.\n\n\n=== Financial troubleshooter (1981–1987) ===\nIn August 1981, Epstein founded his own consulting firm, Intercontinental Assets Group Inc. (IAG), which assisted clients in recovering stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers. Epstein described his work at this time as being a high-level bounty hunter. He told friends that he worked sometimes as a consultant for governments and the very wealthy to recover embezzled funds, while at other times he worked for clients who had embezzled funds. Spanish actress and heiress Ana Obregón was one such wealthy client, whom Epstein helped in 1982 to recover her father's millions in lost investments, which had disappeared when Drysdale Government Securities collapsed because of fraud.\nIn the mid-1980s, Epstein traveled multiple times between the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. While in London, Epstein met Steven Hoffenberg. They had been introduced through Douglas Leese, a defense contractor, and John Mitchell, the former U.S. Attorney General. An anonymous source met with Epstein and Leese as early as 1981. Epstein also stated to some people at the time that he was an intelligence agent. Epstein associate Hoffenberg in 2020 alleged that Epstein was recruited in the 1980s by Leese to work for British intelligence, and that Hoffenberg introduced Epstein to Robert Maxwell.\nDuring the 1980s, Epstein possessed an Austrian passport that had his photo, but with a false name. The passport showed his place of residence as Saudi Arabia. In 2017, \"a former senior White House official\" reported that Alexander Acosta, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida who had handled Epstein's criminal case at the end of the George W. Bush's presidency, had stated to interviewers of President Donald Trump's first transition team: \"I was told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' and to 'leave it alone'\", and that Epstein was \"above his pay grade\".\nDuring this period, one of Epstein's clients was the Saudi Arabian businessman Adnan Khashoggi, who was the middleman in transferring American weapons from Israel to Iran as part of the Iran–Contra affair in the 1980s. Khashoggi had been introduced to him by Leese. Khashoggi was one of several defense contractors that he knew.\n\n\n=== Towers Financial Corporation (1987–1993) ===\nSteven Hoffenberg hired Epstein in 1987 as a consultant for Towers Financial Corporation (unaffiliated with the company of the same name founded in 1998, and acquired by Old National Bancorp in 2014), a collection agency that bought debts people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies. Hoffenberg set Epstein up in offices in the Villard Houses in Manhattan and paid him US$25,000 per month for his consulting work (equivalent to $69,000 in 2024).\nHoffenberg and Epstein then refashioned themselves as corporate raiders using Towers Financial as their raiding vessel. One of Epstein's first assignments for Hoffenberg was to implement what turned out to be an unsuccessful bid to take over Pan American World Airways in 1987. A similar unsuccessful bid in 1988 was made to take over Emery Air Freight Corp. During this period, Hoffenberg and Epstein worked closely together and traveled everywhere on Hoffenberg's private jet.\nIn 1993, Towers Financial Corporation imploded when it was exposed as one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in American history, losing over US$450 million of its investors' money (equivalent to $1 billion in 2024). In court documents, Hoffenberg claimed that Epstein was intimately involved in the scheme. Epstein left the company by 1989 and was never charged for involvement in the massive investor fraud committed. It is unknown if Epstein acquired any stolen funds from the Towers Ponzi scheme.\n\n\n=== J. Epstein & Company (1988–2019) ===\n\nIn 1988, while Epstein was still consulting for Hoffenberg, he founded his financial management firm, J. Epstein & Company. The company was said by Epstein to have been formed to manage the assets of clients with more than US$1 billion in net worth, although others have expressed skepticism that he was restrictive of the clients that he took.\nThe only publicly known billionaire client of Epstein was Leslie Wexner, chairman and CEO of L Brands (formerly The Limited, Inc.) and Victoria's Secret. In 1986, Epstein met Wexner through their mutual acquaintances, insurance executive Robert Meister and his wife, in Palm Beach. A year later, Epstein became Wexner's financial adviser and served as his right-hand man. Within the year, Epstein had sorted out Wexner's entangled finances. In July 1991, Wexner granted Epstein full power of attorney over his affairs. The power of attorney allowed Epstein to hire people, sign checks, buy and sell properties, borrow money, and do anything else of a legally binding nature on Wexner's behalf. Epstein managed Wexner's wealth and various projects such as the building of his yacht, the Limitless. It was during this time that Southern Air Transport relocated its headquarters to service Wexner's brands, and that Epstein dated models like Stacey Williams. Epstein represented himself as a global talent scout for Victoria's Secret during this time and used this powerful position to manipulate young women into his bed.\nBy 1995, Epstein was a director of the Wexner Foundation and Wexner Heritage Foundation. He was also the president of Wexner's Property, which developed part of the town of New Albany outside Columbus, Ohio, where Wexner lived. Epstein made millions in fees by managing Wexner's financial affairs. Although never employed by L Brands, he frequently corresponded with the company executives. Epstein often attended Victoria's Secret fashion shows, and hosted the models at his New York City home, as well as helping aspiring models get work with the company.\nIn 1996, Epstein changed the name of his firm to the Financial Trust Company and, for tax advantages, based it on the island of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. By relocating to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Epstein was able to reduce federal income taxes by 90 percent. The U.S. Virgin Islands acted as an offshore tax haven, while at the same time offering the advantages of being part of the United States banking system; Epstein, who capitalized on his relation with Jes Staley while the latter was employed by JP Morgan, maintained close relations with that bank's subsidiary in the USVI. \nIn 2002, according to New York Magazine, his financial-administrative staff numbered 150 employees (among whom 20 accountants) across three sites: Villard House in Manhattan, the Wexner operation in Columbus, and St Thomas USVI.\nAccording to Forbes in 2025, the great majority of Epstein's wealth between 1999 and 2018 came from $490 million in fees, (most of that from two billionaires, Leslie Wexner, $200 million, and Leon Black, $170 million) with the remaining $310 million reported as income during that period by his companies as being from investment returns, and was worth $600 million when he died.\nIn the course of his life Epstein engaged with no fewer than 75 lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz, Kenneth Starr, Roy Black and Jay Lefkowitz. Senator Ron Wyden said in Congress that the US Treasury Department file on Epstein detailed from one account no less than 4,725 wire transfers that totalled $1.1 billion, and that he had extensive financial correspondence from Russian banks over his sex trafficking activities. Epstein controlled more than 156 bank accounts, and JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank paid compensation to girl victims that by 2025 totalled over $200 million. Another report from Forbes]] says that between four banks (JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Bank of New York Mellon and Bank of America) the transfers totalled more than $1.9 billion.\n\n\n==== Liquid Funding and the Bear Stearns explosion (2000–2008) ====\nEpstein was the president of the Bermuda-incoporated company Liquid Funding Ltd. between 2000 and 2007. The company was an early pioneer in expanding the kind of debt that could be accepted on repurchase, or the repo market, which involves a lender giving money to a borrower in exchange for securities that the borrower then agrees to buy back at an agreed-upon later time and price. The innovation of Liquid Funding, and other early companies, was that instead of having stocks and bonds as the underlying securities, it had commercial mortgages and investment-grade residential mortgages bundled into complex securities as the underlying security.\nLiquid Funding was initially 40 percent owned by Bear Stearns, and it was among the first to use the investment strategy. Through the help of credit rating agencies—Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service—the new bundled securities were able to be created for companies so that they received a gold-plated AAA rating. In fact, two of JPMorgan’s mutual funds held a total of $100 million; two Dreyfus mutual funds held at least $139 million; and a Frank Russell mutual fund held $125 million. The implosion of such complex securities, because of their inaccurate ratings, led to the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 and set in motion the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession. If Liquid Funding were left holding large amounts of such securities as collateral, it could have lost large amounts of money.\n\nIn August 2006, Epstein, a month after the federal investigation of him began, invested $57 million in the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage hedge fund. The SEC filings for the Bear Stearns fund show that Epstein’s Financial Trust Company controlled the votes of a 10 percent share. This fund was highly leveraged in mortgage-backed collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).\nOn April 18, 2007, an investor in the fund, who had $57 million invested, discussed redeeming his investment. At this time, the fund had a leverage ratio of 17:1, which meant for every dollar invested there were 17 dollars of borrowed funds; therefore, the redemption of this investment would have been equivalent to removing $1 billion from the thinly traded CDO market. The selling of CDO assets to meet the redemptions that month began a repricing process and general freeze in the CDO market. The repricing of the CDO assets caused the collapse of the fund three months later in July, and the eventual collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008. Losses to investors in the two Bear Stearns funds were estimated to exceed $1.6 billion.\nBy the time the Bear Stearns fund began to fail in May 2007, Epstein had begun to negotiate a plea deal with the U.S. Attorney's Office concerning imminent charges for sex with minors. In August 2007, a month after the fund collapsed, the U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, entered into direct discussions about the plea agreement. Acosta brokered a lenient deal, according to him, because he had been ordered by higher government officials, who told him that Epstein was an individual of importance to the government.\nAs part of the negotiations, according to the Miami Herald, Epstein provided \"unspecified information\" to the Florida federal prosecutors for a more lenient sentence and was supposedly Unnamed investor #1 for the New York federal prosecutors in their unsuccessful June 2008 criminal case against Cioffi and Tannen, two of the managers of the failed Bear Stearns hedge fund.\nAlan Dershowitz, one of Epstein's attorneys in the 2008 criminal case, told Fox Business Network in 2019, \"We would have been touting that if he had [cooperated]. The idea that Epstein helped in any prosecution is news to me.\" On the other hand, reports exist that Epstein's subprime investment vehicle had somehow repaid all its debt, or it was forgiven in the subprime bailout. Moody's reported that on 18 April 2008 \"all outstanding rated liabilities\" of Liquid Funding were \"paid in full\". At the time the liquidator had not yet sold the beleaguered fund to its new owner as of 1 May: JP Morgan.\n\n\n==== Epstein & Zuckerman (2003–2004) ====\nIn 2003, New York Daily News publisher Mortimer Zuckerman partnered with Epstein, advertising executive Donny Deutsch, and investor Nelson Peltz in a bid to acquire the New York magazine. The ultimate buyer was Bruce Wasserstein, a longtime Wall Street investment banker, who paid US$55 million, over US$10 million above the offer from Zuckerman, Epstein, Deutsch, and Peltz.\nIn 2004, Epstein and Zuckerman committed up to US$25 million to finance Radar, a celebrity and pop culture magazine founded by Maer Roshan. Epstein and Zuckerman were equal partners in the venture. Roshan, as its editor-in-chief, retained a small ownership stake. It folded after three issues as a print publication and became exclusively an online one.\n\n\n==== Zwirn (2002–2008) ====\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Epstein invested $80 million in the D.B. Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund, a hedge fund that invested in illiquid debt securities. In November 2006, Epstein attempted to redeem his investment after he was informed of accounting irregularities in the fund. By this time, his investment had grown to $140 million. The D.B. Zwirn fund refused to redeem the investment. Hedge funds that invest in illiquid securities typically have years-long \"lockups\" on their capital for all investors and require redemption requests to be made in writing 60 to 90 days in advance. The fund was closed in 2008, and its remaining assets of approximately $2 billion, including Epstein's investment, were transferred to Fortress Investment Group when that firm bought the assets in 2009. Epstein later went to arbitration with Fortress over his redemption attempt. The outcome of that arbitration is not publicly known.\n\n\n==== Carbyne (2015) ====\n\nAfter his first arrest, Epstein tried to get access to the emerging industry of surveillance. Leaked emails (released by the hacker group Handala, which \"likely operates out of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence\", according to Reuters) show that Epstein leveraged his relationship with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak (who met Epstein around 30 times between 2013 and 2017, and according to emails leaked by Handala, having visited Epstein's private island together with his wife while arranging to leave his security team behind in January 2014 ) to approach powerful figures like Peter Thiel, a former director of Israeli signals intelligence, and two people in Vladimir Putin's circle (former Russian Deputy Minister of Economic Development Sergey Belyakov and Viktor Vekselberg).\nIn 2015, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Epstein invested in the startup Reporty Homeland Security (rebranded as Carbyne in 2018). The startup was connected with Israel's defense industry and headed by Barak. The CEO of the company is Amir Elihai, a special forces officer, and Pinchas Bukhris, a director of the company and former defense ministry director general and commander of IDF cyber unit 8200. Epstein had past experience with Israel's research and military sector. In April 2008, he went to Israel and met with a number of research scientists and visited different Israeli military bases.\nEpstein arranged for Barak to meet Thiel in New York on 9 June 2014. In 2016, he pitched Reporty to Thiel-founded Valar Ventures (in 2015 and 2016, Epstein invested US$40 million into funds managed by Valar ), but the proposal got rejected on account of being premature, but Valar's McCormack said they would try to reengage when the startup was more developed. In 2018, the Founders Fund, another firm co-founded by Thiel, joined the $15 million Series B.\nWhile scheduling the meeting with Thiel, Barak also discussed with Epstein about meeting Putin's ally Viktor Vekselberg on the 6th and 8th day of June 2014. An email sent in April 2015 shows that Barak asked Epstein for his opinion on Vekselberg-backed Fifth Dimension, a startup which later shut down after being sanctioned in 2018 by the US for alleged election meddling.\n\n\n== Video, photo and email archives ==\nMultiple well-placed sources told Vicky Ward that Epstein lacked a moral compass, and decided to compromise influential people \"by recording them doing things they wouldn’t want made public.\"\nGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein's long-term girlfriend and companion, told a friend that Epstein's private island in the Virgin Islands was completely wired for video and the friend believed that Maxwell and Epstein were videotaping everyone on the island as an insurance policy. When police raided his Palm Beach residence in 2006, two hidden cameras were discovered in his home. It was also reported that Epstein's mansion in New York was wired extensively with a video surveillance system. Epstein associate Hoffenberg alleged in 2020 that Epstein and Maxwell were agents for UK and Israeli intelligence.\nMaria Farmer, an artist who worked for Epstein in 1996, noted that Epstein showed her a media room in the New York mansion where there were individuals monitoring the pinhole cameras throughout the house. The media room was accessed through a hidden door. She stated that in the media room \"there were men sitting here. And I looked on the cameras, and I saw toilet, toilet, bed, bed, toilet, bed.\" She added that \"It was very obvious that they were, like, monitoring private moments.\"\nEpstein allegedly \"lent\" girls to powerful people to ingratiate himself with them and also to gain possible blackmail information. According to the Department of Justice, he kept compact discs locked in his safe in his New York mansion with handwritten labels that included the description: \"young [name] + [name]\". On the occasion of his 2019 arrest the FBI confiscated the contents, which are said to include photographs of important men and underage girls. Epstein implied that he had blackmail material when he told a New York Times reporter in 2018, off the record, that he had dirt on powerful people, including information about their sexual proclivities and recreational drug use. Retired FBI agent Paul Hutchinson explains that there existed a conscious and willing trade in kompromat between the subject and his increase in power, obtained through Epstein in the form of contacts, deals or other untraceable quid pro quo.\nIn August 2025 Michael Wolff remarked that Epstein's email archives, which were seized when the FBI raided Herbert Strauss house and took possession of his computers, are likely to incriminate others.\n\n\n== Audio recordings ==\nIn 2003, Epstein spoke in an interview, over the course of more than five hours, with journalist David Bank, which was in a cache of recordings, unpublished, prior to August 14, 2019.\nIn 2017, Epstein spoke in interviews, over the course of more than one hundred hours, with journalist Michael Wolff, which began to be released in November 2024, as part of Wolff's Fire and Fury podcast.\n\n\n== Legal issues ==\nMaria Farmer alleges that she reported that Epstein raped her to the New York City Police Department and the FBI in 1996 but nothing was done and his depravity went unpunished for a decade longer. Virginia Giuffre was among the first of Epstein's accusers to reveal her identity to the public, in 2011.\n\n\n=== First criminal case (2005–2011) ===\n\n\n==== Initial developments (2005–2006) ====\nAccording to The Washington Post, in November 2004, Palm Beach police were tipped about young women coming and going from Epstein’s home. In March 2005, a woman contacted Florida's Palm Beach Police Department and alleged that her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to Epstein's mansion by an older girl. While there, she was allegedly paid $300 (equivalent to $480 in 2024) to strip and massage Epstein. She had allegedly undressed, but left the encounter wearing her underwear. Palm Beach Police began a 13-month undercover investigation of Epstein, including a search of his home. During the investigation, Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter publicly accused the Palm Beach County state prosecutor, Barry Krischer, of being too lenient and called for help from the FBI.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) then became involved. Subsequently, the police alleged that Epstein had paid several girls to perform sexual acts with him. Interviews with five alleged victims and seventeen witnesses under oath, a high-school transcript and other items found in Epstein's trash and home allegedly showed that some of the girls involved were under 18, the youngest being 14, with many under 16. The police search of Epstein's home found two hidden cameras and large numbers of photos of girls throughout the house, some of whom the police had interviewed in the course of their investigation. Adriana Ross, a former model from Poland who became an Epstein assistant, reportedly removed computer drives and other electronic equipment from the financier's Florida mansion before Palm Beach Police searched the home as part of their investigation. The court documents record that a search of Epstein's residence by Palm Beach Police detective Joseph Recarey in 2005 uncovered an incriminating Amazon receipt containing books on S&M. The books he ordered are titled: SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude—Principles, Skills and Tools and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners.\nA former employee told the police that Epstein would receive massages three times a day. Eventually the FBI compiled reports on \"34 confirmed minors\" eligible for restitution (increased to 40 in the non-prosecution agreement) whose allegations of sexual abuse by Epstein included corroborating details. Julie Brown's 2018 exposés in the Miami Herald identified 80 victims and located about 60 of them. She quotes the then police chief Reiter as saying \"This was 50-something 'shes' and one 'he'—and the 'shes' all basically told the same story.\" Details from the investigation included allegations that 12-year-old triplets were flown in from France for Epstein's birthday, and flown back the following day after being sexually abused by the financier. It was alleged that young girls were recruited from Brazil and other South American countries, former Soviet countries, and Europe, and that Jean-Luc Brunel's \"MC2\" modeling agency was also supplying girls to Epstein, who actually financed the French agency.\nIn May 2006, Palm Beach police filed a probable cause affidavit saying that Epstein should be charged with four counts of unlawful sex with minors and one count of sexual abuse. On July 27, 2006, Epstein was arrested by the Palm Beach Police Department on state felony charges of procuring a minor for prostitution and solicitation of a prostitute. He was booked at the Palm Beach County jail and later released on a $3,000 bond. State prosecutor Krischer later convened a Palm Beach County grand jury, which was usually only done in capital cases. Presented evidence from only two victims, the grand jury returned a single charge of felony solicitation of prostitution, to which Epstein pleaded not guilty in August 2006. Epstein's defense lawyers included Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt, Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, and former U.S. Solicitor General Ken Starr. Linguist Steven Pinker also assisted.\n\n\n==== Non-prosecution agreement (NPA) (2006–2008) ====\n\nIn July 2006, the FBI began its own investigation of Epstein, nicknamed \"Operation Leap Year\". It resulted in 53 page indictment in June 2007. Alexander Acosta, then the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, agreed to a plea deal, which Alan Dershowitz helped to negotiate, to grant immunity from all federal criminal charges to Epstein, along with four named co-conspirators and any unnamed \"potential co-conspirators\". According to the Miami Herald, the non-prosecution agreement \"essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein's sex crimes\". At the time, this halted the investigation and sealed the indictment. The Miami Herald said: \"Acosta agreed, despite a federal law to the contrary, that the deal would be kept from the victims.\"\nAcosta later said he offered a lenient plea deal because he was told that Epstein \"belonged to intelligence\", was \"above his pay grade\" and to \"leave it alone\". Epstein agreed to plead guilty in Florida state court to two felony prostitution charges, serve 18 months in prison, register as a sex offender, and pay restitution to three dozen victims identified by the FBI. The plea deal was later described as a \"sweetheart deal\".\n\n A federal judge later found that the prosecutors had violated victims' rights by concealing the agreement from the victims and instead urging them to have \"patience\". According to an internal review conducted by the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility, released in November 2020, Acosta showed \"poor judgment\" in granting Epstein a non-prosecution agreement and failing to notify Epstein's alleged victims about the agreement.\nIn 2019, Judge Kenneth Marra for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida adjudicated that the Acosta NPA document had violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act. A later Appeals court judgment called the Acosta NPA \"a national disgrace\". The terms of the Acosta NPA were revealed only after Bradley Edwards, the representative of two of Epstein's teenaged victims, and press lawyers successfully sued to make them public.\n\n\n==== Conviction and sentencing (2008–2011) ====\nOn June 30, 2008, after Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of procuring for prostitution a girl below age 18, he was sentenced to eighteen months in prison. While most convicted sex offenders in Florida are sent to state prison, Epstein was instead housed in a private wing of the Palm Beach County Stockade and, according to the sheriff's office, was, after 3+1⁄2 months, allowed to leave the jail on \"work release\" for up to twelve hours a day, six days a week. This contravened the sheriff's own policies requiring a maximum remaining sentence of ten months and making sex offenders ineligible for the privilege. He was allowed to come and go outside of specified release hours.\nEpstein's cell door was left unlocked, and he had access to the attorney room where a television was installed for him, before he was moved to the Stockade's previously unstaffed infirmary. He worked at the office of a foundation he had created shortly before reporting to jail; he dissolved it after he had served his time. The Sheriff's Office received $128,000 from Epstein's non-profit to pay for the costs of extra services being provided during his work release. His office was monitored by \"permit deputies\" whose overtime was paid by Epstein. They were required to wear suits, and checked in \"welcomed guests\" at the \"front desk\". Later the Sheriff's Office said these guest logs were destroyed per the department's \"records retention\" rules, although the Stockade visitor logs were not. Epstein was allowed to use his own driver to drive him between jail and his office and other appointments.\n\nEpstein served almost 13 months of his 18-month sentence before being released on July 22, 2009, for a year of probation on house arrest until August 2010. His early release after 13 of 18 months served was because he grassed on Bear Stearns executives Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, whose conduct was scrutinized by the SDNY court in In re Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. Securities, Derivative and ERISA Litigation, before JPMorgan Chase swooped in to save Bear's carcass. Coincidentally, Epstein's subprime investment vehicle Liquid Funding had somehow repaid all their debt, or it was forgiven.\nWhile on probation, he was allowed numerous trips on his corporate jet to his residences in Manhattan and the U.S. Virgin Islands. He was allowed long shopping trips and walks around Palm Beach \"for exercise\". After a contested hearing in January 2011, and an appeal, he stayed registered in New York State as a \"level three\" (high risk of repeat offense) sex offender, a lifelong designation.\nAt that hearing, the Manhattan assistant district attorney, Jennifer Gaffney, argued unsuccessfully that the level should be reduced to a low-risk \"level one\" and was chided by the judge. Despite opposition from Epstein's lawyer that he had a \"main\" home in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the judge confirmed he personally must check in with the New York Police Department every 90 days. Though Epstein had been a level-three registered sex offender in New York since 2010, the New York Police Department never enforced the 90-day regulation, though non-compliance is a felony.\n\n\n==== Reactions ====\nThe immunity agreement and Epstein's lenient treatment were the subject of ongoing public dispute. The Palm Beach police chief accused the state of giving him preferential treatment, and the Miami Herald said U.S. Attorney Acosta gave Epstein \"the deal of a lifetime\". Following Epstein's arrest in July 2019, on sex trafficking charges, Acosta resigned as Secretary of Labor effective July 19, 2019.\nAfter the accusations against Epstein became public, several persons and institutions returned donations that they had received from him, including Eliot Spitzer, Bill Richardson, and the Palm Beach Police Department. Harvard University announced it would not return any money. Various charitable donations that Epstein had made to finance children's education were also questioned.\nOn June 18, 2010, Epstein's former house manager, Alfredo Rodriguez, was sentenced to 18 months' incarceration after being convicted on an obstruction charge for failing to turn over to police, and subsequently trying to sell, a journal in which he had recorded Epstein's activities. FBI Special Agent Christina Pryor reviewed the material and agreed it was information \"that would have been extremely useful in investigating and prosecuting the case, including names and contact information of material witnesses and additional victims\".\n\n\n=== Second criminal case (2019) ===\nEpstein thought that his 2007 non-prosecution agreement with the Attorney-General's department could be relied upon, until he was caught by surprise. Over the two years leading up to his second arrest, Epstein hired Steve Bannon, in order to prepare him for a media appearance in which Epstein would offer a mea culpa to a TV camera. At times, journalist Michael Wolff participated behind the scenes. Bannon coached Epstein to paint himself in the best possible light under hostile questions. Copies of the tapes remain in Bannon's hands. The public interview never occurred for reasons known only to the protagonists. Until Wolff's publication in June 2019 of Siege, Epstein had kept silent about his relationship with then-President Trump and Epstein now regretted his disclosures to Wolff.\n\n\n==== Sex trafficking charges ====\n\nOn July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested when he returned to the US from France by the FBI-NYPD Crimes Against Children Task Force at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on charges of sex trafficking during the years 2002 to 2005. He was jailed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. According to witnesses and sources on the day of his arrest, about a dozen FBI agents forced open the door to his Manhattan townhouse, the Herbert N. Straus House, with search warrants. The search of his townhouse turned up evidence of sex trafficking and also found \"hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully—or partially—nude females\". Some of the photos were confirmed as those of underage females. In a locked safe, compact discs were found with handwritten labels including the descriptions: \"Young [Name] + [Name]\", \"Misc nudes 1\", and \"Girl pics nude\". Ann Coulter alleges that the videotapes were mishandled and as a result those now in possission of the FBI may not be complete.\nAlso found in the safe were $70,000 in cash, 48 diamonds, and a fraudulent Austrian passport, which expired in 1987, that had Epstein's photo but another name. The passport had numerous entrance and exit stamps, including entrance stamps that showed the use of the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. The passport showed his place of residence as Saudi Arabia. According to his attorneys, Epstein had been advised to acquire the passport because \"as an affluent member of the Jewish faith\", he was in danger of being kidnapped while traveling abroad.\nOn July 8, prosecutors with the Public Corruption Unit of the Southern District of New York under Geoffrey Berman charged him with sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors for sex. The grand jury indictment alleges that \"dozens\" of underage girls were brought into Epstein's mansions for sexual encounters. Judge Kenneth Marra was to decide whether the non-prosecution agreement that protected Epstein from the more serious charges should still stand.\n\nEpstein requested to be released on bond, offering to post $100 million with the condition that he would also submit to house arrest in his New York City mansion. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman denied the request on July 18, saying that Epstein posed a danger to the public and a serious flight risk to avoid prosecution. He had another bail hearing scheduled for the subsequent week when he died. On August 29, 2019, 19 days after Epstein was found dead in his jail cell, the case against Epstein was closed by Judge Berman. Prosecutors stated they would continue an investigation for potential co-conspirators.\n\n\n==== Investigation in France ====\nOn August 23, 2019, the prosecutor's office in Paris, France, opened a preliminary investigation into Epstein, after Yael Mellul wrote to the Paris prosecutor to report the international dimensions of the pedophile network involving Jeffrey Epstein, criticizing the slow pace of justice. He is being investigated for rape and sexual assault of minors under and over the age of 15, criminal association with a view to committing crimes, and association with criminals with a view to committing offenses. The prosecutors said that the goal of the investigation is to find possible crimes committed in France and elsewhere against French citizens. An associate of Epstein,  modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, was arrested during this investigation, but was found dead in his jail cell in 2022.\n\n\n=== Civil cases ===\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Romances and procuresses ===\nPrevious long-term girlfriends of Epstein include Eva Andersson-Dubin and Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of British-Israeli publisher Robert Maxwell.\n\n\n==== Eva Anderson-Dubin (1980s) ====\nEpstein dated Andersson-Dubin for an 11-year period mostly in the 1980s and the two later remained friendly well after her marriage to Glenn Dubin.\n\n\n==== Ghislaine Maxwell (1991–2006?) ====\nEpstein met Maxwell, daughter of disgraced media baron Robert Maxwell, by 1991. Epstein had Maxwell come to the United States in 1991 to recover from her grief following the death of her father. Maxwell was later implicated by several of Epstein's accusers as procuring or recruiting underage girls in addition to being, for an extended period of time, Epstein's chief girlfriend. At Maxwell's 2021 trial, the prosecution successfully won with the statement that Epstein and Maxwell \"were predators together.. they molested kids together.\"\nSeveral of Epstein's household employees testified in 2009 that Maxwell had a central role in both his public and private life, referring to her as his \"main girlfriend\" who also handled the hiring, supervising, and firing of staff starting around 1992. In 1995, Epstein renamed one of his companies the Ghislaine Corporation in Palm Beach, Florida; the company was dissolved in 1998. In 2000, Maxwell moved into a 7,000-square-foot townhouse, less than ten blocks from Epstein's New York mansion. This townhome was purchased for $4.95 million by an anonymous limited liability company, with an address that matches the office of J. Epstein & Co. Representing the buyer was Darren Indyke, Epstein's longtime lawyer. A picture of Epstein and Maxwell, sitting at a cabin on Queen Elizabeth II's Balmoral estate, around 1999, at the invitation of Prince Andrew, was shown to her jury to establish their status as romantic partners. In a 2003 Vanity Fair article, Epstein refers to Maxwell as \"my best friend\". In January 2003, for a 50th birthday gift, Maxwell assembled an album of well-wishes from his friends; among the bawdy greetings was one from Donald Trump. Two decades later, in July 2025, with Epstein files in the public spotlight, the Wall Street Journal revealed details of the album.\n\n\n==== Karyna Shuliak (2010–2019) ====\nEpstein's last female partner was known as Karyna Shuliak. He maintained his relationship even while he was jailed in 2019. She is \"one of the largest beneficiaries\" of several of his financial arrangements that continue post-mortem. She is Belarusian by birth and was nicknamed \"the inspector\" because of her \"jealousy\" and the fine tooth with which she combed through his agenda and contact list. A Fox News journalist writes that the \"pair's relationship began shortly after Epstein was released from a Florida jail in 2010 for procuring a minor for prostitution,\" and that \"Shuliak was the last person to speak on the phone with Epstein before\" his death. The couple had been together in Paris before his return to the US and his arrest as he deplaned, which she witnessed. He paid for her education as a dentist. She did not think he sounded suicidal when she spoke to him scant hours before his death, in a 15-minute call not logged and not recorded by his guards, as ought to have been the practice. Epstein had not only paid for her education, he had paid for her mother's medical care and the purchase of her parents' house in Belarus.\n\n\n=== Victims ===\nThe first of Epstein's hundreds of victims to reveal her identity to the public, Virginia Giuffre, told The New Yorker that Epstein \"picked vulnerable victims... By the time she was 13, she was living on the streets, where she was abused by older men. Life with Epstein provided a kind of security; he paid her, got her an apartment, and took her to New Mexico, London, Paris, Tangiers, and his island. When she was dismayed by her life, she said, she self-medicated with Xanax.\"\nA woman attested in a since-discontinued lawsuit that Epstein employed her to procure underage girls, including at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, for him and that she had witnessed at least one rape by Epstein. Barry Levine, author of The Spider: Inside the Criminal Web of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, has documented that girls as young as 12 were trafficked from countries such as France, Russia and Turkiye to Epstein's island in the USVI.\nAttorney Brad Edwards, who represents more than 200 victims, notes that Epstein himself sexually abused all of these women and girls, but only a very small percentage of them was sent to be sexually abused by other men, who were also a select few.\nIn October 2007, transgender model Ava Cordero alleged that Epstein had abused her and filed suit accordingly, however this was widely dismissed - with press at the time instead making allegations about Cordero's mental health and mocking her gender identity.\n\n\n=== Cronies and hangers-on ===\nEpstein was a longtime acquaintance of Prince Andrew and Tom Barrack, and attended parties with many prominent people, including Bill Clinton, George Stephanopoulos, Mark Zuckerberg, Reid Hoffman, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Katie Couric, Woody Allen, Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Lewis Ranieri, Ronald Perelman, Tom Pritzker, Naomi Campbell, and Stephen Hawking. Two printed phone directories belonging to Epstein, commonly referred to as the \"black books\", included Rupert Murdoch, Michael Bloomberg, Andrew Cuomo, John Kerry, Richard Branson, Alec Baldwin, David Koch, and Michael Jackson. These books also included Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, British prime minister Tony Blair, and Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. Epstein was somehow involved with Sarah Ferguson and Maxwell maintains that he bailed Fergie out of deep financial difficulties. Epstein was seen at least once talking with Princess Diana; he also negotiated a 1993 divorce settlement for Lynn Forester before she married Evelyn de Rothschild. Lady de Rothschild re-introduced Epstein to Alan Dershowitz, presumably in connection to a donation Epstein made to Larry Summers's school; they had known each other at least since 1997, when their friendship was revealed by flight logs published in 2015. Both Clinton and Trump said that they never visited Epstein's Little Saint James island, though Clinton was listed on Epstein's flight logs at least 11 times with Sarah Kellen between 2002 and 2003; Epstein owned the island from 1998 until his death in 2019.\nIn 2014 Epstein asked journalist Michael Wolff to write his biography. Wolff, who frequented Epstein after 2014, feels that the parvenu operated a form of private gentlemen's club imbued with an air of a modern Jay Gatsby. As an example, Epstein took on an African safari trip aboard his Boeing 727 jet, among others: Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. Dr Andrew Lownie, author of Entitled: the rise and fall of the House of York, remarks that Epstein circulated among his houseguests \"catalogs of photographs. We know that there were books of photographs passed around Epstein's homes where powerful men could choose the [women] they wanted to meet.\"\nMultiple well-placed sources told Vicky Ward that Epstein lacked a moral compass, and decided to compromise influential people \"by recording them doing things they wouldn’t want made public.\" He told a journalist with the New York Times in August 2018 that he \"had dirt on powerful people\", \"including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use.\"\nDisgust with Epstein was cited by Melinda French Gates as one of the reasons for her divorce of Bill Gates, who met Epstein after he had been convicted for paedophilia. A New York Times article reported that Bill Gates's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein started in 2011, just a few years after Epstein's conviction, and continued for some years. In August 2021, Gates said the reason he had meetings with Epstein was because Gates hoped Epstein could provide money for philanthropic work, though nothing came of the idea. Gates added, \"It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there.\" Epstein was also longtime acquaintance of Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway, with whom he stayed in contact for several years after his release from prison.\nAccording to Wolff, political strategist Steve Bannon and Epstein were introduced not long after Bannon's August 2017 ejection from the White House. Bannon met with Epstein several times at his mansion in New York. Also according to Wolff, Bannon coached Epstein for a 60 Minutes interview which never occurred.\nFrom the 1990s to mid-2000s, Epstein often socialized with Donald Trump. Wolff wrote that Trump, Epstein, and Tom Barrack were at the time like a \"set of nightlife musketeers\" on the social scene. Epstein and Trump socialized both in New York City and Palm Beach, where they both had houses.  In a profile of Epstein in New York magazine in 2002 Donald Trump remarked: \"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\" In July 2019, Trump said \"I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him\", stating four times he had not been \"a fan\" of Epstein and that he had not spoken to him in about 15 years. A video shot in 1992 surfaced showing the two men partying together at Mar-a-Lago. According to The Washington Post, one person who knew Epstein and Trump during this time noted that \"they were tight\" and \"they were each other's wingmen\". In November 2004, Epstein and Trump's friendship ran into trouble when they became embroiled in a bidding war for a $40 million mansion, Maison de L'Amitié, which was being auctioned in Palm Beach. Trump won the auction for $41 million, and successfully sold the property four years later for $95 million to the Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. That month was the last time Epstein and Trump were recorded to have interacted. By 2007, Trump reportedly banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club for unseemly pursuit of young girls. The ban allegation was included in court documents filed by attorney Bradley Edwards, although Edwards later said it was a rumor he tried to, but could not, confirm. He later told him in 2017: \"I was Donald's closest friend for ten years,\" although Wolff opines that on some level after Trump's election Epstein feared Trump, ostensibly because over the course of their decades long friendship each had accumulated information that could incriminate the other. In August 2025 The Daily Beast published an article which claimed that Epstein had remained a member at Mar-a-Lago for years after the date on which Trump had claimed to cancel Epstein's membership. \nIn 2002, a spokesman of Bill Clinton lauded Epstein as \"a committed philanthropist\" with \"insights and generosity\". At the time Epstein was on the board of Rockefeller University, a member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a major donor to Harvard University. Epstein visited the White House while Clinton was president on four known occasions. In 1993, he went to a donor event at the White House with his companion Ghislaine Maxwell. Around the same time, he also met with President Clinton's aide Mark Middleton on at least three occasions at the White House. In 1995, financier Lynn Forester discussed \"Jeffrey Epstein and currency stabilization\" with Clinton. Epstein, according to his own accounts, was heavily involved in the foreign exchange market and traded large amounts of currency in the unregulated forex market. In 1995, Epstein also attended a small political fundraiser dinner for Bill Clinton which included 14 other people including Ron Perelman, Don Johnson, Jimmy Buffett, and dinner organizer Paul Prosperi. Dershowitz claimed that \"outside of his immediate family\" he only ever showed manuscripts before they were published to his friend Epstein.\n\n\n=== Club memberships ===\nEpstein was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1995 to 2009, the Trilateral Commission, the Rockefeller Institute, and the Institute of International Education.\n\n\n=== Lolita Express ===\nEpstein, who often is pictured with or in a Gulfstream G-550 jet with tail number N550GP, owned company JEGE with which he chartered it, also owned a private Boeing 727 jet, nicknamed the \"Lolita Express\" by local residents, and traveled in it frequently, logging \"600 flying hours a year ... usually with guests on board\". The jet was nicknamed the Lolita Express by the locals in the Virgin Islands, because of its frequent arrivals at Little Saint James with apparently underage girls. According to Vicky Ward who interviewed him for a 2002 Vanity Fair article, Epstein \"went berserk if you mentioned\" either the topic of Steven Hoffenberg or his affinity for girls, and he issued threats to harm her professional reputation:\n\nIf there’s any implication of wrong doing, I will take legal action against you personally. I’m telling you so you understand. I will be as harsh as I possibly can personally … not for the magazine, but you, because I had this discussion with you. This relationship is with you.… You shouldn’t risk your future for a job.\nForbes reports that between 1990 and 2001, the Lolita jet was owned by Wexner, who then transferred it for an undisclosed sum to Epstein, or one of his corporations. Trump flew at least six times on Epstein’s planes between 1993 and 1997. Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton also flew on Epstein's planes. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was interviewed in the course of his failed 2024 bid for the presidency, and came clean about his innocent travels with Epstein. In 2003, Epstein flew to Cuba aboard his plane with Colombian president Andrés Pastrana Arango at the invitation of Cuban president Fidel Castro. According to Fabiola Santiago of the Miami Herald, Epstein was likely considering relocating to Cuba in order to evade U.S. law enforcement, which was investigating him at the time.\nIn 2009, Epstein's brother Mark claimed Trump had flown on Epstein's plane at least once. He later told The Washington Post that Trump flew \"numerous times\" on Epstein's airplane, although Mark was present on only one of the flights. According to Michael Corcoran, Trump flew Epstein on his own airplane at least once. In September 2002, Epstein flew Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa in this jet. Flight records obtained in 2016 show Bill Clinton flew 27 times to at least a dozen international locations.\nThose flight logs did not list any Secret Service detail accompanying Clinton for at least five flights on a 2002 trip to Asia, and Secret Service stated that there is no evidence of the former president making a trip to Epstein's private island. In 2019, a Clinton spokesperson stated that, in 2002 and 2003, Clinton took four trips on Epstein's airplane, making stops on three continents, all with his staff and Secret Service detail. At the time of Epstein's 2019 arrest, Clinton's spokeswoman Angel Ureña stated that Clinton had \"not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein's ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida\".\n\n\n=== Wealth ===\n\nAccording to Forbes in 2025, the great majority of Epstein's wealth between 1999 and 2018 came from $490 million in fees, (most of that from two billionaires, Leslie Wexner, $200 million, and Leon Black, $170 million) with the remaining $310 million reported as income during that period by his companies as being from investment returns. Due to the U.S. Virgin Islands' economic development plan's tax exemptions, his corporations saved $300 million in taxes and paid an effective tax rate of 4%, even though the top marginal tax rate for corporations on the islands was 38.5%. In 2025 Epstein's estate received $105 million in tax refunds.\nLes Wexner was one source of Epstein's original wealth. An assistant of Epstein also stated that he got his fortune started through Robert Maxwell, the media mogul father of Ghislaine Maxwell. When Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting and procuring prostitution, his lawyers stated he was a billionaire with a net worth of over one billion dollars. A number of sources, however, have questioned the extent of Epstein's wealth and his status as a billionaire. According to an article in The New York Times, his \"fortune may be more illusion than fact\". Epstein lost \"large sums of money\" in the 2008 financial crisis, and \"friends and patrons\"—including retail billionaire Leslie Wexner—\"deserted him\" following his pleading guilty to prostitution charges in 2008. New York magazine claimed that \"there's scant proof\" of Epstein's \"financial bona fides\", and Forbes also ran an article entitled \"Why sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is not a billionaire\".\nSpencer Kuvin, an attorney for three of Epstein's alleged victims in the case where Epstein pleaded guilty to sexual activity with minors, stated that \"he and his team 'pursued every possible angle' to find out Epstein's net worth but found that much of his wealth is offshore\". An investigation by the Miami Herald of the Swiss Leaks documents indicated that Epstein had multiple financial accounts with millions of dollars in offshore tax havens. In the Paradise Papers, records showed that Epstein in February 1997, became a client of Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm which specialized in the creation of offshore companies and investment vehicles for the ultra-wealthy. A client profile of Epstein described his job cryptically as the \"Manager of Fortune\".\nFederal prosecutors on July 12, 2019, stated in court documents that, based on records from one financial institution, Jeffrey Epstein was \"extravagantly wealthy\" and had assets worth at least $500 million and earned more than $10 million a year. The extent of his wealth, however, was not known, since he had not filled out a financial affidavit for his bail application. According to Bloomberg News, \"Today, so little is known about Epstein's current business or clients that the only things that can be valued with any certainty are his properties.\" The Miami Herald in their investigation of the Paradise Papers and Swiss Leaks documents concluded that Epstein's wealth is likely spread secretly across the globe.\nIn 2020, Epstein estate's finances revealed that it had paid out nearly $50 million between June 2020 and December 2020 to more than one-hundred women who brought claims to the \"Epstein Victims Compensation Fund\" set up in the U.S. Virgin Islands. By February 2021, the estate was valued at about $240 million, down from estimates of $630 million a year earlier. This prompted the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Denise George, to file an emergency motion seeking the immediate asset freeze. She contended in the court filing, which the victims joined, that the estate executors had \"mismanaged\" the money.\n\n\n=== Residences ===\n\nAs Epstein was a criminal and because his criminality needed to flourish behind closed doors, this section is split up according to the District system in use by the US Federal Courts and US Department of Justice.\n\n\n==== Southern District of New York ====\nEpstein owned the Herbert N. Straus House on 9 East 71st Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. It was originally purchased for $13.2 million in 1989 by Epstein's mentor, Les Wexner, who renovated it completely. Epstein moved into the mansion in 1995 after Wexner married and moved with his wife to Columbus, Ohio, to raise their family. He took full possession of the mansion in 1998, when he paid Wexner $20 million for it. The house was valued in 2019 by federal prosecutors at $77 million, while the city assessed its value at $56 million. The mansion is reputedly the largest private residence in Manhattan at 21,000 sq ft (2,000 m2).\nHidden under a flight of stairs, there is a lead-lined bathroom fitted with its own closed-circuit television screens and a telephone, both concealed in a cabinet under the sink. The house also has its own heated sidewalk to melt away the snow. The entrance hall is lined with rows of individually framed prosthetic eyeballs that were made in England for injured soldiers.\nPrevious to his final Manhattan home at Herbert Straus House, Epstein resided in a spacious townhouse, which was a former Iranian government building that had been taken over by the State Department during the Iranian revolution, at 34 East 69th Street. He leased it for a rate of $15,000 a month from 1992 to 1995.\nBefore the Herbert Straus house was sold to Epstein by Wexner, Wexner purchased in 1988 the adjacent townhouse at 11 East 71st Street. Like in the case of the 9 East 71st Street house, Epstein was on the deed of the 11 East 71st Street house as the trustee. The 11 East 71st Street townhouse was sold in 1996 to the Comet trust, which as of 2019 held part of the assets of the de Gunzburg/Bronfman family.\nThe chief federal prosecutor for the Southern District when Epstein was charged in July 2019 was interim U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman.\n\n\n==== US Virgin Islands ====\nEpstein owned two islands in the US Virgin Islands:\n\na private island near Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands called Little Saint James, which includes a mansion and guest houses, purchased in 1998;\nand the neighboring island of Great Saint James purchased in 2016.\nHe structured two financial shells called Financial Trust Company (FTC) and Southern Trust around his activities there; this Trust's bank was JPMorganChase and the bank settled a lawsuit with the Attorney General there in December 2022 for $105 million over allegations that it helped what was a criminal enterprise to prosper. Epstein's Southern Trust \"made fraudulent misrepresentations to the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority regarding its qualifications for Economic development corporation tax benefits.\" The bank said that the Trust obtained $300 million in tax credits, and paid the US Virgin Islands police. Epstein's estate was nearing settlement of another lawsuit filed by the Attorney General in March 2022.\nAccording to Forbes, the FTC generated fee income from 2000 to 2006 of $300 million. FTC's main business was attentive to Wexner. After the two men fell out in 2007 and over the next six years, the FTC generated less than $5 million. The FTC was Epstein's primary source of income for the earlier period.\nAgain according to Forbes the Southern Trust was attentive to the needs of Leon Black, and this trust business was set up in 2013 as the result of discussions between the principals.\nIn January 2023 the Attorney-General of the US Virgin Islands, Denise George, was fired from her job by governor Albert Bryan Jr. because she was too good at it, just days after she filed charges against JP MorganChase over Epstein and his Southern Trust, which she characterized as a criminal enterprise. The wife of the Democratic governor of the USVI from 2007-2015, John de Jongh, was employed by the Southern Trust, in addition to being on the board of directors of the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation.\nStephen Deckoff, the founder of Black Diamond Capital Management, bought Epstein's islands in 2023 for $60 million.\n\n\n==== Southern District of Florida ====\nEpstein had a 14,000-square-foot, six-bedroom residence at 358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach, Florida, which he purchased in 1990. It is roughly two miles north of Mar-a-Lago. It was bought for $18.5 million in 2021 by a property developer who demolished it and changed the address before flipping the empty lot six months later for a gain of $7.5 million.\nAnn Coulter maintains that the State Attorney for Palm Beach in 2006, Barry Krischer, treated Epstein with kid gloves after the police investigation turned up 17 girls who signed affidavits against him. Under Krischer, the state grand jury indicted him for solitication. After Federal Attorney Alex Acosta joined the fray, Epstein pled guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and was punished by day-release. Coulter maintains that Krischer trod lightly on Epstein because of his DNC connections, and Chief Michael Reiter was furious with the result but could do nothing. The Epstein file remained dormant until law professor Paul G. Cassell and Bradley Edwards argued in a 2014 Florida lawsuit that the victims had not been given fair warning of the Acosta plea bargain deal as mandated by the Crime Victims' Rights Act in Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States.\n\n\n==== District of New Mexico ====\nEpstein had a 7,500-acre (30 km2) ranch named Zorro Ranch near Stanley, New Mexico, purchased in 1993 for roughly $12 million.\n\n\n==== Southern District of Ohio ====\nEpstein previously owned a mansion outside Columbus, Ohio, at 5025 East Dublin Granville Road near Wexner's home from 1992 to 1998 which he purchased from his mentor. It was there that he and Maxwell molested Marie Farmer who was prevented from leaving by his security guards, though that allegation was not tested in court because of the settlement that she signed with the Epstein estate before trial. In the event, she was rescued by her father some 12 hours after her illegal detention.\n\n\n==== France ====\nEpstein possessed seven units in an apartment building near the Arc de Triomphe at 22 Avenue Foch in Paris, France;\n\n\n==== Palm Beach residence gallery ====\n\n\n==== Manhattan residence gallery ====\n\n\n=== Offices ===\nEpstein rented offices for his business dealings in the Villard House at 457 Madison Avenue. Steven Hoffenberg originally set up the offices for Epstein in 1987 when he was consulting for Tower Financial. Epstein used these offices until at least 2003. Around this time, Michael Wolff saw the financier in his office, which in the past were the offices of Random House. Wolff noted that Epstein's offices were a strange place which did not have a corporate feel at all. Wolff stated that the offices were \"almost European. It's old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way.\" Wolff continued that \"the trading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They're like a throwback, a bunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and a view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say 'What's going on here?' and he gives you that Cheshire smile.\"\nEpstein rented multiple apartment units for his employees, models, and guests since the 1990s at 301 East 66th Street. The majority of the apartment complex at this address is owned by Ossa properties, which is owned by Jeffrey Epstein's brother, Mark, who purchased the complex in the early 1990s from Wexner.\nOver the years Epstein has housed different friends at 11 East 71st Street, including his ex-girlfriend Eva Andersson, who is now married to his hedge-fund friend Glenn Dubin, MC2 Models founder Jean-Luc Brunel, and on occasions former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. He has housed some of his workers, including his pilot, housekeeper and office work staff, in the apartment complex. Epstein has also housed underage girls, who Brunel scouted for his MC2 modeling agency. On August 6, 2012, a model and party promoter associated with MC2, Pedro Gaspar, who lived above another of the modeling agency's locations in Manhattan, died of what some consider to be a suspicious drug overdose.\n\n\n=== Political donations ===\n\nIn 2002 Epstein said \"I invest in people — be it politics or science. It's what I do\". From 1989 until 2003, Epstein donated more than $139,000 to U.S. Democratic Party federal candidates and committees and over $18,000 to U.S. Republican Party candidates and groups. Epstein contributed $10,000 to refurbish the West Wing of the White House in 1993, which bought him and Maxwell a series of photographs with Bill Clinton. He was noted for his contributions to Senators Al d'Amato and George J. Mitchell.\nEpstein contributed $50,000 to Democrat Bill Richardson's successful campaign for Governor of New Mexico in 2002 and again for his successful run for reelection in 2006. Also that year, he contributed $15,000 to Democrat Gary King's successful campaign for Attorney General of New Mexico. He later contributed $35,000 to King's 2014 unsuccessful campaign for Governor. Other contributions in New Mexico included $10,000 toward Jim Baca's campaign to become head of the land commission and $2,000 toward Santa Fe County Sheriff Jim Solano's bid for reelection. In 2010, Epstein received a notice from New Mexico Department of Public Safety which said, \"You are not required to register [as a sex offender] with the state of New Mexico.\" This was in contravention of federal law, which would seem to say that the conviction in Florida required him to register in New Mexico.\n\n\n=== Alleged connections to intelligence agencies ===\nEpstein was rumored in 2021 by Vicky Ward in Rolling Stone to be associated with various intelligence agencies, and bragged to a journalist that he knew the owner of the East African port of Djibouti so well that he could use it for contraband. The U.S. journalists Dylan Howard, Melissa Cronin and James Robertson linked Epstein to the Israeli Mossad in their book Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales. They relied for the most part on the former Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe. According to him, Epstein's activities as a spy served to gather compromising material on powerful people in order to blackmail them. There is also a possible connection to the Mossad via Ghislaine Maxwell, whose father Robert Maxwell is said to have had contacts with the Mossad. Epstein's victim Virginia Giuffre also alleged Epstein to be an intelligence asset, linking on Twitter to a Reddit page, that alleged Epstein was a spy, running a blackmail operation.\nAs U.S. Attorney in Florida, the later U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta reached a settlement with Epstein's lawyers (including Alan M. Dershowitz) in 2008, which allowed him to receive a very light prison sentence. Acosta later reportedly stated that he was told that Epstein \"belonged to intelligence\" and that the issue was above his \"pay grade.\" According to Acosta, he was pushed to give him a good deal. Former CIA Director and diplomat William J. Burns met with Epstein three times. According to a CIA spokesperson, Burns hoped that Epstein would help him \"transition to the private sector.\"\nAccording to the Dossier Center (a Russian opposition media outlet founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky), Epstein had ties at least as early as 2014 to Russian civil servant Sergei Belyakov, a graduate of the FSB Academy and sometime head of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum; during this engagement he advised Russian government circles on how to circumvent western sanctions against the country. According to journalist Michael Wolff, Epstein told him he flew furtively at least once to Moscow, in early 2017, to meet with Vladimir Putin, to whom Epstein bragged repeatedly about providing services in the final decade of his life. In 2020 reportedly his Belarusian \"girlfriend\" had yet to be investigated by Bill Barr's FBI.\nJohn Mark Dougan was the deputy sheriff of Palm Beach County (where Epstein was first arrested) until his dismissal in 2009. He was then recruited by Russian intelligence and worked as a disseminator of disinformation on behalf of the Russian government. According to British media reports, Dougan may came into possession of some of Epstein's kompromat, which he allegedly copied and handed over to Russia. Other intelligence agencies (Israel, Saudi Arabia, Libya) may also have obtained the material.\nGhislaine Maxwell told Todd Blanche in his July 2025 prison interview of her, that tales of Epstein's involvement with intelligence agencies during her relationship with him are \"bullshit\". Previously Maxwell maintained that Epstein's planes were \"wire-tapped\" for \"leverage\" and in conversation with Christina Oxenberg she speculated that the audio and video recordings could potentially incriminate co-conspirators and high-profile figures who were associates of Epstein.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\n\nIn 1991, Epstein was one of four donors who pledged to raise US$2 million for a Hillel student building Rosovsky Hall at Harvard University. In the 1990s Epstein donated $10,000 to the White House Historical Association. In 2000, Epstein established the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, which funds science research and education. Prior to 2003, the foundation funded Martin Nowak's research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In May 2003, Epstein pledged a series of donations totaling US$30 million to create a mathematical biology and evolutionary dynamics program at Harvard which was run by Martin Nowak. According to The Boston Globe, the actual amount received from Epstein was US$6.5 million. Epstein was friends with and funded Gerald Edelman, Stephen Kosslyn, Danny Hillis, and Lawrence Krauss.\nIn 2006 the Epstein foundation funded a physics conference called \"Confronting Gravity\". In 2019, Forbes deleted a 2013 article that called Epstein \"one of the largest backers of cutting edge science\" after The New York Times revealed that its author, Drew Hendricks, had been paid $600 to submit it falsely as his own.\nAccording to attorney Gerald B. Lefcourt, Epstein was \"part of the original group that conceived of the Clinton Global Initiative\" and in 2006 he donated $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\nEpstein co-organized a science event with illusionist and skeptic Al Seckel called the Mindshift Conference. The conference took place in 2010 on Epstein's private island Little Saint James. In attendance were scientists Murray Gell-Mann, Leonard Mlodinow, and Gerald Jay Sussman. The true extent of Epstein's donations is unknown. The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation fails to disclose information which other charities routinely disclose. Concerns have been raised over this lack of transparency. In 2015, the Attorney General of the state of New York was reported to be trying to gain information but was refused since the charities were based outside of the state and did not solicit in New York State. According to a New York Times investigation, an Epstein-owned charity donated $2.3 million to former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak between 2004 and 2006, and later invested $1 million in a partnership with Barak in 2015. It was also reported that Barak met with Epstein \"dozens of times\" from 2013 onwards.\nEpstein, besides making donations through the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, also made a number of charitable donations through his three private charities: Epstein Interest, the COUQ Foundation, and Gratitude American Ltd. According to federal tax filings, Epstein donated $30 million between 1998 and 2018, through these three charities. Following his death, a number of scientists and institutions—including Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)—came under criticism for accepting money from Epstein and his foundation, with some individuals offering to give away money donated by Epstein.\n\n\n==== Interest in eugenics and transhumanism ====\nAccording to various sources, beginning in the early-2000s Epstein developed a strong interest in \"improving\" the human race through genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, including using his own sperm. He addressed the scientific community at various events and occasions and communicated his fascination with eugenics. It was reported in August 2019 that Epstein had planned to \"seed the human race with his DNA\" by impregnating up to 20 women at a time using his New Mexico compound as a \"baby ranch\", where mothers would give birth to his offspring. He was an advocate of cryonics and his own idiosyncratic version of transhumanism, and had said that he intended to have his penis and head frozen.\nIn response to the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation donations, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania said: \"Scientists need funding for important work ... if the funding is for legitimate scientific work, there is nothing wrong with accepting support from a billionaire. However it would have been wrong for scientists to accept his funding if they were aware that he was planning a eugenics experiment that might draw legitimacy from his association with them.\" Harvard Professor George Church also publicly apologized for meeting Epstein after his 13-month sentence in 2009, saying: \"There should have been more conversations about, should we be doing this, should we be helping this guy? There was just a lot of nerd tunnel vision.\"\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nOn July 23, 2019, Epstein was found injured and semiconscious at 1:30 a.m. on the floor of his cell, with marks around his neck. His cellmate, former New York City police officer Nicholas Tartaglione, who was awaiting trial for four counts of murder, was questioned about Epstein's condition. He denied having any knowledge of what happened. Correctional staff suspected attempted suicide, but did not rule out the possibility it was staged or that he was assaulted by another inmate. According to NBC News, two sources said that Epstein might have tried to hang himself, a third said the injuries were not serious and could have been staged, and a fourth source said that an assault by his cellmate had not been ruled out. After that incident, he was placed on suicide watch. Six days later, on July 29, 2019, Epstein was taken off suicide watch and placed in a special housing unit with another inmate. Epstein's close associates said he was in \"good spirits\".\nWhen Epstein was placed in the special housing unit, the jail informed the Justice Department that he would have a cellmate, and that a guard would look into the cell every 30 minutes. These procedures were not followed on the night of his death. On August 9, 2019, Epstein's cellmate was transferred out, but no one took his place. Later in the evening, contrary to the jail's normal procedure, Epstein was not checked every 30 minutes. The two guards who were assigned to check his jail unit that night fell asleep and did not check on him for about three hours; the guards falsified related records. Two cameras in front of Epstein's cell also malfunctioned that night.\nEpstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York City at 6:30 a.m. EDT on August 10, 2019. The Bureau of Prisons said lifesaving measures were initiated immediately upon the discovery of Epstein's body. Emergency responders were called and he was taken to a hospital. On August 10, 2019, the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Attorney General William Barr called the death an apparent suicide, although no final determination had been made. The United States Department of Justice's Inspector General's investigation report released on June 27, 2023, criticized jail officials for repeated \"negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures\" in connection with Epstein's incarceration and death. It also denied the suggestion that what happened was anything other than a suicide. In May 2025, the FBI announced plans to release surveillance footage from the night of Jeffrey Epstein's death, aiming to address ongoing conspiracy theories. Deputy Director Dan Bongino stated that the video clearly shows Epstein alone in his cell, with no evidence of outside involvement, reaffirming the official ruling of suicide.\n\n\n=== Autopsy ===\n\nOn August 11, 2019, an autopsy was performed. It appeared likely that Epstein had thrown himself violently off the cell's top bunk, which would explain the damage he suffered, other than strangulation. The preliminary result of the autopsy found that Epstein sustained multiple breaks in his neck bones. Among the bones broken in Epstein's neck was the hyoid bone. Such breaks of the hyoid bone can occur from those who hang themselves from some substantial height, e.g. jumping from a chair into the rope, but they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation. A 2010 study found broken hyoids in 25 percent of cases of hangings. A larger study conducted from 2010 to 2016 found hyoid damage in just 16 of 264, or six percent, of cases of hangings. Hyoid bone breaks become more common with age, as the bones become more brittle. Forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht noted that hanging by leaning forward would not result in broken cervical bones.\nOn August 16, 2019, Barbara Sampson, the New York City medical examiner, ruled Epstein's death a suicide by hanging. The medical examiner, according to Epstein's defense counsel, only saw nine minutes of footage from one security camera to help her arrive at her conclusion. Epstein's defense lawyers were not satisfied with the conclusion of the medical examiner and were conducting their own independent investigation into the cause of Epstein's death, including taking legal action, if necessary, to view the pivotal camera footage near his cell during the night of his death. Epstein's lawyers said that the evidence concerning Epstein's death was \"far more consistent\" with murder than suicide. Michael Baden, an independent pathologist hired by the Epstein estate, observed the autopsy. In October 2019, Baden said that Epstein had experienced a number of injuries—among them a broken bone in his neck—that \"are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation\". Baden stated that he thinks that the evidence points to homicide rather than suicide. Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, opines that the evidence points to \"professional hit men\".\n\n\n=== Final will ===\n\nOn August 18, 2019, it was reported that Epstein had signed his last will and testament on August 8, 2019, two weeks after being found injured in his cell and two days before his death. Until this time, Epstein had been depositing money in other inmates' commissary accounts to avoid being attacked. \n\n\n=== Burial ===\nFollowing the autopsy, Epstein's body was claimed by his brother Mark. On September 5, 2019, Epstein's body was interred in an unmarked crypt next to those of his parents at the I.J. Morris Star of David Cemetery in Palm Beach, Florida. The names of his parents were also removed from their crypt in order to prevent vandalism.\n\n\n=== Investigations ===\n\nAttorney General Barr ordered an investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General in addition to the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, saying he was \"appalled\" by Epstein's death in federal custody. Two days later Barr said there had been \"serious irregularities\" in the prison's handling of Epstein, promising: \"We will get to the bottom of what happened, and there will be accountability.\" On August 14, 2019, Manhattan federal court Judge Richard M. Berman, who was overseeing Epstein's criminal case, wrote to the Metropolitan Correctional Center warden Lamine N'Diaye inquiring as to whether an investigation into the millionaire's apparent suicide would include a probe into his prior (July 23) injuries. Judge Berman wrote that, to his knowledge, it has never been definitively explained what they concluded about the incident.\n\nThe national president of the Council of Prison Locals C-33, E. O. Young, stated that prisons \"can't ever stop anyone who is persistent on killing themselves\". Between 2010-16, around 124 inmates killed themselves while in federal custody, or around 20 prisoners per year, out of an inmate population of 180,000. The previous reported inmate suicide in the MCC facility in Manhattan was in 1998. The union leader Young said it was unclear if there was video of Epstein's hanging or direct observations by jail officials. He said that while cameras are ubiquitous in the facility, he did not believe that the interior of inmates' cells was within their range. Young said union officials had long been raising concerns regarding staffing, as the Trump administration had imposed a hiring freeze and budget cuts on the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), adding: \"All this was caused by the administration.\"\nPresident Serene Gregg, of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3148, said MCC was functioning with fewer than 70 percent of the needed correctional officers, forcing many to work mandatory overtime and 60-to-70-hour workweeks. In previous congressional testimony, Attorney General Barr admitted the BOP was \"short\" about 4,000 to 5,000 employees. He had lifted the freeze and was working to recruit sufficient new officers to replace those who had departed.\nEpstein's attorneys asked Judge Berman to probe their client's death, alleging they could provide evidence that the incident resulting in his death was \"far more consistent with assault\" than suicide. One week after having signed his final will, it had been reported that at least one camera in the hallway outside Epstein's cell had footage that was unusable, although other usable footage was recorded in the area. Two cameras that malfunctioned in front of Epstein's cell were sent to an FBI crime lab for examination. Federal prosecutors subpoenaed up to 20 correctional officers concerning the cause of Epstein's death.\nOn November 19, 2019, federal prosecutors in New York charged Metropolitan Correctional Center guards Michael Thomas and Tova Noel with creating false records, and with conspiracy, after video footage obtained by prosecutors revealed that Epstein had, against regulation, been in his cell unchecked for eight hours prior to being found dead. On May 22, 2021, the two guards admitted they falsified records but were spared from any time behind bars under a deal with federal prosecutors. As part of a deferred prosecution agreement, on May 25, both officers pleaded guilty to falsifying records and conspiracy to defraud the United States. They were sentenced to six months supervisory release and were required to perform 100 hours of community service. On December 19, 2023, New York judge Loretta Preska ordered a list with names of more than 170 Epstein associates to be unsealed on January 1, 2024. Anyone on the list had until January 1 to appeal to have their name removed.\nIn February 2025, second Trump administration's Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Jeffrey Epstein's client list was \"sitting on my desk\" for review, and in June, Elon Musk alleged that President Trump himself was in the Epstein files.\nOn July 8, Bondi and FBI head Kash Patel announced that there was no client list, no evidence that Epstein had blackmailed anyone, that Epstein had killed himself, and released footage showing a partial view of a common area and obscured view of the stairs leading to Epstein's cell block —though that footage was not able to be independently verified. A minute was found missing from the footage soon after, where the clock jumps from 11:58:58 to 12:00:00. A Wired investigation found that the video had been modified despite the FBI's claim that it was raw, and that nearly three minutes were cut out of the video. CBS News cited an unnamed government official, who said that the video had been deliberately edited to remove a minute, and an unedited version is in possession of the FBI.\nOn July 15, 2025, Rep Thomas Massie submitted House Resolution 119-581, co-sponsored by Ro Khanna, to force the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files. The same pair announced on August 12 that they would bring a number of Epstein's victims to the Capitol on September 3, the day the House returns from August vacation. Massie told ABC's Jonathan Karl that \n\n[this motion] would force a full release of the files. It has the force of law. It’s not a subpoena. It’s not a pretty please would you release the files. It’s the force of law.. It’s emblematic of the promise that President Trump brought with him to the White House, how he energized so many people who had checked out of the political system. He was going to be the guy who holds all the rich and powerful and politically connected people accountable, and that’s why there’s so much disappointment right now.\nOn 25 August 2025 the House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to Acosta requesting his testimony in the Epstein file. His name was not in the initial batch of subpoenas the committee sent out earlier in August, which included Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and former Attorneys General Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, William Barr, Merrick Garland, Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales. Acosta's testimony is scheduled for September 19.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nEpstein's death became the subject of widespread controversy and debate, with the belief that his death was a homicide becoming a popular meme. HBO is creating a limited series on Epstein's life and death to be directed and executive produced by Adam McKay. Sony Pictures Television is additionally developing a miniseries based on Epstein's life. In the season four finale of the CBS series The Good Fight, the plot revolves around Epstein's death. The Netflix documentary series Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich premiered in May 2020. The Lifetime documentary Surviving Jeffrey Epstein premiered in August 2020.\nOn July 1, 2020, a statue of Epstein was left outside the City Hall in Albuquerque, New Mexico as a satirical commentary on opposition to the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials. Footage of Trump and Epstein talking at the 1992 Mar-a-Lago party appears in the 2020 comedy mockumentary Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, where the footage is shown inspiring Borat to gift his teen daughter to someone in Trump's inner circle (with Borat deciding on Mike Pence, and later Rudy Giuliani). Later in the film, one of Borat's children also changes his name to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nBrown, Julie K.

        "title": "Travis Kelce",
        "content": "Travis Michael Kelce (  KEL-see; born October 5, 1989) is an American professional football tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2013 NFL draft and later won Super Bowls LIV, LVII, and LVIII with the team. He played college football for the Cincinnati Bearcats.\nConsidered one of the greatest tight ends in history, Kelce is a ten-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro, with four first-team and three second-team selections. He holds the NFL records for most consecutive and most overall seasons with 1,000 receiving yards by a tight end: seven. He holds the record for most receiving yards by a tight end in a single season with 1,416 in 2020, despite playing in only 15 games.\nDuring the 2022 season, Kelce became the fifth NFL tight end to reach 10,000 career receiving yards and reached the milestone faster than any tight end in NFL history. Kelce was named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team. During the 2023 season, he surpassed Jerry Rice in career playoff receptions en route to winning Super Bowl LVIII, his fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons.\nOutside of football, Kelce has appeared on reality and scripted television, including being the namesake of the dating show Catching Kelce on E!, hosting a 2023 episode of Saturday Night Live, and in advertisements. He co-hosts the podcast New Heights with his brother Jason, covering topics from football to popular culture. The show was ranked as the 8th most popular podcast in the United States on Apple Podcasts in 2024.\nKelce's relationship with and subsequent engagement to singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has drawn massive media coverage and stimulated viewership and revenue for his team and the NFL.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKelce was born on October 5, 1989, in Westlake, Ohio. His father, Ed Kelce, is a former sales representative in the steel industry, and his mother, Donna, is a former bank executive. Travis's older brother is Jason Kelce, who played center for the Philadelphia Eagles for 13 seasons.\nHe is of Croatian descent through his mother, whose ancestors were from Brod Moravice and Velike Drage in the Gorski Kotar region, near the Slovenian border.\nKelce attended Cleveland Heights High School in his hometown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He was a three-year letter winner as quarterback for the Tigers. As a senior in 2007, he ran for 1,016 yards and 10 touchdowns and threw for 1,523 yards, 21 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 2,539 yards of total offense garnered him All-Lake Erie League honors.\n\n\n== College career ==\nConsidered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Kelce accepted a scholarship offer from the University of Cincinnati over offers from Akron, Eastern Michigan, and Miami (OH). He joined his brother, Jason Kelce, who was the starting left guard for the Bearcats. After redshirting in 2008, he appeared in 11 games in 2009, playing at tight end and quarterback out of the Wildcat formation. He tallied eight rushes for 47 yards and two touchdowns and had one reception for three yards. He was suspended for the 2010 season after testing positive for marijuana, a violation of team rules. Returning for the 2011 season, he played tight end, recording 13 catches totaling 150 yards and two touchdowns. In 2012, his last collegiate season, he set personal season highs in receptions (45), receiving yards (722), yards per receptions (16.0), and receiving touchdowns (8). Kelce earned first-team all-conference honors and in March 2013,  was named the College Football Performance Awards Tight End of the Year. Kelce graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree, he received his diploma during an April 2024 podcast event at the Fifth Third Arena with his brother Jason.\n\n\n=== College statistics ===\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== 2013 season ===\n\nKelce was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round (63rd pick overall) of the 2013 NFL draft. The Chiefs had hired Andy Reid as their new head coach during the off-season. Reid was familiar with Kelce, having drafted and coached his brother, Jason Kelce, in 2011 during his time as the head coach of the Eagles. Reid believed Kelce to be a first round talent but had reservations due to his suspension in college; Jason spoke with Reid and vouched that Travis would stay out of trouble if drafted. On June 6, 2013, the Chiefs signed Kelce to a four-year, $3.12 million rookie contract that also included a signing bonus of $703,304.\nKelce injured his knee in the preseason. The injury was later diagnosed as a bone bruise. After being limited the first two weeks of the season due to the injury and being inactive the next three games, Kelce was placed on injured reserve on October 12, 2013, after having a microfracture surgery performed on his knee. He only played one snap, on special teams in the Chiefs' Week 2 game against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n\n=== 2014 season ===\n\nDuring Week 3 against the Miami Dolphins, Kelce recorded his first NFL touchdown on a 20-yard reception from quarterback Alex Smith. On November 30, he was fined $11,025 for \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" during a 29–16 loss to the Denver Broncos. Kelce made an inappropriate hand gesture and motion at Broncos linebacker Von Miller. Chiefs' head coach Andy Reid later called this \"immature\". In the next game against the Arizona Cardinals, Kelce had seven receptions for 110 yards for his first NFL game with over 100 receiving yards. In the regular-season finale against the San Diego Chargers, he had an offensive fumble recovery for a touchdown in the 19–7 victory. Kelce was the Chiefs' leading receiver during the 2014 season, totaling 862 yards off 67 receptions.\n\n\n=== 2015 season ===\n\nKelce began the 2015 season with his first NFL multiple touchdown game, with six receptions for 106 yards and two touchdowns in the 27–20 victory over the Houston Texans. It was his only 100-plus-yard game, but he had at least one reception in all 16 games, and was ranked a top-five tight end by ESPN. He started all 16 regular season games and recorded 72 catches for 875 yards and five touchdowns, earning his way to his first Pro Bowl. The Chiefs finished the regular season with an 11–5 record and made the playoffs. In his first NFL playoff game, Kelce had eight receptions for 128 yards in a 30–0 Wild Card Round victory over the Texans. In the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, Kelce had six receptions for 23 yards as the Chiefs lost 27–20. He was ranked 91st by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.\n\n\n=== 2016 season ===\n\nOn January 29, 2016, Kelce signed a five-year, $46 million contract extension. He was ranked 91st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.\nDuring Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts, Kelce had seven receptions for 101 yards and a touchdown.

From 2017 to 2022, Kelce was in a relationship with social media influencer Kayla Nicole Brown.\nKelce began dating the singer-songwriter Taylor Swift in 2023,  and the pair have since been frequently described in the media as a \"supercouple.\" In June 2024, Kelce joined Swift onstage at her Wembley Stadium concert from the Eras Tour during her performance of \"I Can Do It with a Broken Heart\". In August 2025, Swift announced details of her forthcoming album The Life of a Showgirl on New Heights. The couple became engaged later that month. Their engagement announcement became one of Instagram's top 10 most-liked and reposted posts. \nTheir highly publicized relationship and Swift's attendance at games stimulated interest in the Chiefs and the NFL during the 2023 NFL season, breaking viewership, ticket sales, and merchandise sales records: a Chiefs–Chicago Bears game drew the most television viewers of the weekend; a Chiefs–New York Jets game averaged 27 million viewers, making it the most-watched Sunday-night television show since Super Bowl LVII; and a Chiefs–Buffalo Bills game on January 21, 2024, became the most-watched NFL divisional playoff game ever and the most-watched program on any network since Super Bowl LVII. The Chiefs–Baltimore Ravens AFC Conference Championship Game was the most watched AFC Championship game of all time. One widely cited estimate by a sports marketing company said the Kelce–Swift relationship had so stimulated ticket sales, viewership, and merchandising that in just six months the Chiefs franchise had gained $331.4 million in value. \nKelce plays golf during the offseason. He has participated in several celebrity tournaments, including the American Century Championship, at which he won the long drive contest in the 2023 edition. In 2023, he participated in The Match VIII, teaming up with his Chiefs teammate Patrick Mahomes against Golden State Warriors teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Mahomes and Kelce won. Kelce owns homes in the Kansas City area and a condo in Baldwin Park, Florida. He is also an avid car collector.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of National Football League career receiving touchdowns leaders\nList of National Football League career receiving yards leaders\nList of National Football League career receptions leaders\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCareer statistics from NFL.com · ESPN · CBS Sports · Yahoo Sports · Pro Football Reference\nKansas City Chiefs profile\nCincinnati Bearcats profile\nEighty-Seven & Running",

        "title": "Freakier Friday",
        "content": "Freakier Friday is a 2025 American fantasy comedy film directed by Nisha Ganatra and written by Jordan Weiss. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, it is a sequel to Freaky Friday (2003), itself based on Mary Rodgers's 1972 novel, and the seventh overall film in the franchise. Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan, Mark Harmon, Chad Michael Murray, Rosalind Chao, Ryan Malgarini, Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Lucille Soong reprise their respective roles from the original film, with Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons in her feature film debut and Manny Jacinto joining the cast. It features Anna Coleman (Lohan) and Tess Coleman (Curtis) trying to regain their bodies after respectively switching with the former's daughter Harper (Butters) and soon-to-be stepdaughter Lily Reyes (Hammons) before Anna's wedding to Lily's father Eric (Jacinto).\nFilming for Freakier Friday took place from June to August 2024. It premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on July 22, 2025, and was released theatrically by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on August 8. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for the performances of both Lohan and Curtis and has grossed $135 million worldwide.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nTwenty-two years after the the first film, a now adult Anna Coleman works as a music producer and is a single parent by choice, raising her teenage daughter Harper with the occasional help of her mother Tess. At school, Harper is constantly annoyed by her new classmate, British immigrant Lily Reyes due to her snobbish personality. \nWhen Harper and Lily cause an incident at chemistry class, Anna is called to the principal's office, meets Lily's father Eric, and they fall in love. Six months later, they are engaged, and the soon-to-be stepsisters are dissatisfied with their predicament. Harper also worries that her mother will consider moving them to London as Lily wants to return there to attend a fashion academy in honor of her late mother.\nDuring Anna's bachelorette party, Anna and Tess and later Harper and Lily have separate palm readings from the supposed psychic Madame Jen, who tells Harper and Lily a fortune about their fractured lives. An earthquake then occurs, which only the four feel. The next morning, they discover that they switched bodies; Anna with Harper, and Tess with Lily.\nThe experienced Anna and Tess advise Harper and Lily to pretend to be each other rather than telling anyone about the switch until they can change back. Realizing their new identities could help them break their parents apart, Harper and Lily lie about Madame Jen giving them a reading to delay the reverse. Anna and Tess go to school and spend time in detention for a food fight Harper and Lily caused at a bake sale, while Harper and Lily enjoy the advantages of being adults and come up with a sabotage plan to cancel the wedding.\nAt a photoshoot of Anna's client Ella, Harper and Lily help the young singer overcome her recent break-up. They learn about Anna's abandoned rock star dreams and find a love song, which they assume Anna wrote about her high school ex-boyfriend Jake Austin. They seek Jake, and Harper embarrasses herself when unsuccessfully trying to seduce him in Anna's body to disrupt the relationship with Eric.\nAfter escaping detention, Anna and Tess find Madame Jen, who reveals Harper and Lily's fortune but warns them that all the four of them need to \"change their hearts\" in order to change back. Meanwhile, Harper, as Anna, goes to an immigration interview with Eric, and finds out how much he knows about and loves her mother. Eric also says that he thinks it would be the best for their families to stay in Los Angeles, causing Harper to have second thoughts about their sabotage plan. Lily, however, remains determined. She invites Jake to the rehearsal dinner and makes a scene by criticizing the Colemans, leading to a big public argument. Eric decides he cannot continue this way, and calls off the wedding.\nFollowing a heartfelt conversation with Tess about her homesickness and the loss of her mother, Lily starts to realize the error of her ways. As Tess, she tries to convince her father not to give up on Anna. At the same time Anna, followed by Harper, is called to Ella's concert, learning that Ella invited her old band, the Pink Slip, so they could perform together again. \nAlthough happy for the reunion, Anna tells Harper she never regretted abandoning her musician goals because Harper is the best decision she ever made, and the love song was actually written about her. Mother and daughter reconnect as they play the song together on stage. Tess and Lily arrive in time to see it, with Lily happily stating she wants to be a part of this family. Having a change of heart, they all return to their original bodies. Eric arrives to the concert, and he and Anna rekindle their relationship.\nThe next day, the wedding is held, and all relatives celebrate Anna and Eric's happiness. Some time later, the family attends the launch event of Tess's latest book. Tess is shocked to learn that Lily, while she was in Tess's body, made a rather unfavorable picture of her for the book's cover using lip plumper.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nAdditionally, X Mayo appears as Ms. Waldman, the principal at Harper and Lily's school. Chris Carlberg and Danny Rubin reprise their roles of Ethan and Scott, the drummer and bassist of Pink Slip. Lohan's brother Dakota also appears in the film as a surfer. Actress Jodie Foster was approached to cameo in the film, but was ultimately unable to participate.\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn May 2023, Walt Disney Pictures announced a sequel to the fantasy-comedy film Freaky Friday (2003) was in development, written by Elyse Hollander, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan set to reprise their roles as Tess and Anna Coleman, respectively. In March 2024, Lohan confirmed the sequel was in active development, and Nisha Ganatra had been hired to direct the film, with Jordan Weiss rewriting the script. In June 2024, Julia Butters, Manny Jacinto, Sophia Hammons, and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan joined the cast, with Mark Harmon, Chad Michael Murray, Christina Vidal, Haley Hudson, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Rosalind Chao reprising their roles from the original film. The following month, Jordan E. Cooper joined the cast. Principal photography began in Los Angeles on June 24, 2024, and finished on August 21. The film's official title was announced by Curtis and Lohan at the 2024 D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event on August 9. In January 2025, it was revealed that Vanessa Bayer joined the cast. Following the release of the teaser trailer, it was disclosed Elaine Hendrix would also be appearing in the film. Eleanor Infante edited the film.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nIn March 2025, it was announced that Amie Doherty would compose the film's score, after previously collaborating with Ganatra on The High Note (2020). On July 11, 2025, a new version of the song \"Take Me Away\" by the fictional band Pink Slip was released by Hollywood Records as a single for Freakier Friday. A previous version of the song appeared in Freaky Friday. The full soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on August 1, 2025.\n\n\n== Release ==\nFreakier Friday premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on July 22, 2025, and was released theatrically in the United States on August 8.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of September 2, 2025, Freakier Friday has grossed $83 million in the United States and Canada, and $51 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $135 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, Freakier Friday was released alongside Weapons and Sketch, and was projected to gross $27–30 million from 3,975 theaters in its opening weekend. It earned $3.1 million from Wednesday and Thursday preview screenings.\nThe film ended up debuting to $28.6 million, finishing second behind Weapons.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 74% of 217 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Freakier Friday doesn't reinvent the original's story so much as it swaps the formula around for a frothy good time, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan easily slipping back into roles that fit them like mixed-and-matched gloves.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, up from the 2003 film's “A-.”\nMaureen Lee Lenker of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A- and described it as \"a heart-on-its-sleeve ode to strengthening and forging bonds, the power of deep and unconditional love, and the warmth and safety of one's chosen family, most especially when it's at its freakiest.\" Time Out's Olly Richards gave the film three stars out of five and wrote, \"There are almost endless holes you could pick in its logic and storytelling, but it gives you few reasons to want to. This Friday's freakier, but it's kind of… funner too.\" Meanwhile, Stephanie Zacharek of Time said that the movie \"appears to exist largely for one reason: to grift off the fondness many adults have for the original, even though the sequel has none of that picture’s breezy, observant charm.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nFreakier Friday at IMDb",

        "title": "World War II",
        "content": "World War II or the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers. Nearly all of the world's countries participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war. Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II is the deadliest conflict in history, causing the death of 70 to 85 million people, more than half of whom were civilians. Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were tried for war crimes.\nThe causes of World War II included unresolved tensions in the aftermath of World War I, the rise of fascism in Europe and militarism in Japan. Key events preceding the war included Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Spanish Civil War, the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and Germany's annexations of Austria and the Sudetenland. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland, after which the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany. Poland was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. In 1940, the Soviet Union annexed the Baltic states and parts of Finland and Romania. After the fall of France in June 1940, the war continued mainly between Germany and the British Empire, with fighting in the Balkans, Mediterranean, and Middle East, the aerial Battle of Britain and the Blitz, and the naval Battle of the Atlantic. Through campaigns and treaties, Germany gained control of much of continental Europe and formed the Axis alliance with Italy, Japan, and other countries. In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front and initially making large territorial gains.\nIn December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories in Asia and the Pacific, including at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, leading the United States to enter the war against Japan and Germany. Japan conquered much of coastal China and Southeast Asia, but its advances in the Pacific were halted in June 1942 at the Battle of Midway. In early 1943, Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union, and that year their continued defeats on the Eastern Front, an Allied invasion of Italy, and Allied offensives in the Pacific forced them into retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded France at Normandy, as the Soviet Union recaptured its pre-war territory and the US crippled Japan's navy and captured key Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories; invasions of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, which culminated in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; and Germany's unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. On 6 and 9 August, the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Faced with an imminent Allied invasion, the prospect of further atomic bombings, and a Soviet declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its unconditional surrender on 15 August, and signed a surrender document on 2 September 1945.\nWorld War II transformed the political, economic, and social structures of the world, and established the foundation of international relations for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The United Nations was created to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the permanent members of its security council. The Soviet Union and the US emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the half-century Cold War. In the wake of Europe's devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and of Asia. Many countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.\n\n\n== Start and end dates ==\n\nMost historians agree that World War II began with the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 and the United Kingdom and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later. Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937, or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria, on 19 September 1931. Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941. Other proposed starting dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935. The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939. Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War II.\nThe exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951. A 1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place. No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed, although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Aftermath of World War I ===\n\nWorld War I had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires.\nTo prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was established in 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military, and naval disarmament, as well as settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.\nDespite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I, irredentist and revanchist nationalism had emerged in several European states. These sentiments were especially pronounced in Germany due to the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.\n\n\n=== Germany and Italy ===\nThe German Empire was dissolved in the German revolution of 1918–1919, and a democratic government, later known as the Weimar Republic, was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing, and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a \"New Roman Empire\".\n\nAdolf Hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923, eventually became the chancellor of Germany in 1933 when President Paul von Hindenburg and the Reichstag appointed him. Following Hindenburg's death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself Führer of Germany and abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign. France, seeking to secure its alliance with Italy, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.\n\n\n=== European treaties ===\nThe United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards military globalisation; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless. The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year.\nHitler defied the Versailles and Locarno Treaties by remilitarising the Rhineland in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to the policy of appeasement. In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Rome–Berlin Axis. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy joined the following year.\n\n\n=== Asia ===\nThe Kuomintang party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) allies and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, staged the Mukden incident as a pretext to invade Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.\nChina appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in Shanghai, Rehe, and Hebei, until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan. After the 1936 Xi'an Incident, the Kuomintang and CCP forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose Japan.\n\n\n== Pre-war events ==\n\n\n=== Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935) ===\n\nThe Second Italo-Ethiopian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia) by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia), which was launched from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana); in addition it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did little when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's Covenant. The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion. Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing Austria.\n\n\n=== Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) ===\n\nWhen civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the Nationalist rebels, led by General Francisco Franco. Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis: Mussolini sent more than 70,000 ground troops, 6,000 aviation personnel, and 720 aircraft to Spain. The Soviet Union supported the existing government of the Spanish Republic. More than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the International Brigades, also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II but generally favoured the Axis. His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the Eastern Front.\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion of China (1937) ===\n\nIn July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Peking after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge incident, which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China. The Soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with China to lend materiel support, effectively ending China's prior cooperation with Germany. From September to November, the Japanese attacked Taiyuan, engaged the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou, and fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese.\nIn March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at Taierzhuang, but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by the Japanese in May. In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, but the city was taken by October. Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.\n\n\n=== Soviet–Japanese border conflicts ===\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. This policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States and the Western Allies.\n\n\n=== European occupations and agreements ===\n\nIn Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from other European powers. Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands. Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary, and Poland annexed the Trans-Olza region of Czechoslovakia.\nAlthough all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish \"war-mongers\" and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German client state, the Slovak Republic. Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to Lithuania on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the Klaipėda Region, formerly the German Memelland.\n\nGreatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City of Danzig, the United Kingdom and France guaranteed their support for Polish independence; when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to the Kingdoms of Romania and Greece. Shortly after the Franco-British pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel. Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to \"encircle\" Germany and renounced the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish declaration of non-aggression.\nThe situation became a crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany, after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom, and Soviet Union had stalled. This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\" (western Poland and Lithuania for Germany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence. The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I. Immediately afterwards, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.\nIn response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which served as a pretext to worsen relations. On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German minority would vote on secession. The Poles refused to comply with the German demands, and on the night of 30–31 August in a confrontational meeting with the British ambassador Nevile Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.\n\n\n== Course of the war ==\n\n\n=== War breaks out in Europe (1939–1940) ===\n\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion. The first German attack of the war came against the Polish defences at Westerplatte. The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany. During the Phoney War period, the alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a cautious French probe into the Saarland. The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort. Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.\nOn 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of Warsaw. The Polish counter-offensive to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the Wehrmacht. Remnants of the Polish army broke through to besieged Warsaw. On 17 September 1939, two days after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviet Union invaded Poland under the supposed pretext that the Polish state had ceased to exist. On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison surrendered to the Germans, and the last large operational unit of the Polish Army surrendered on 6 October. Despite the military defeat, Poland never surrendered; instead, it formed the Polish government-in-exile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied Poland. A significant part of Polish military personnel evacuated to Romania and Latvia; many of them later fought against the Axis in other theatres of the war.\nGermany annexed western Poland and occupied central Poland; the Soviet Union annexed eastern Poland; small shares of Polish territory were transferred to Lithuania and Slovakia. On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union. The proposal was rejected and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France, which was postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather.\n\nAfter the outbreak of war in Poland, Stalin threatened Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania with military invasion, forcing the three Baltic countries to sign pacts allowing the creation of Soviet military bases in these countries; in October 1939, significant Soviet military contingents were moved there. Finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939, and was subsequently expelled from the League of Nations for this crime of aggression. Despite overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet military success during the Winter War was modest, and the Finno–Soviet war ended in March 1940 with some Finnish concessions of territory.\nIn June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the entire territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as the Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region. In August 1940, Hitler imposed the Second Vienna Award on Romania which led to the transfer of Northern Transylvania to Hungary. In September 1940, Bulgaria demanded Southern Dobruja from Romania with German and Italian support, leading to the Treaty of Craiova. The loss of one-third of Romania's 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II, turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal Ion Antonescu, with a course set towards the Axis in the hopes of a German guarantee. Meanwhile, German–Soviet political relations and economic co-operation gradually stalled, and both states began preparations for war.\n\n\n=== Western Europe (1940–1941) ===\n\nIn April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies were attempting to cut off. Denmark capitulated after six hours, and despite Allied support, Norway was conquered within two months. British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the resignation of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who was replaced by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.\nOn the same day, Germany launched an offensive against France. To circumvent the strong Maginot Line fortifications on the Franco-German border, Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the Ardennes region, which was mistakenly perceived by the Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles. By successfully implementing new Blitzkrieg tactics, the Wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the Allied armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille. The United Kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of Allied troops from the continent by early June, although they had to abandon almost all their equipment.\nOn 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom. The Germans turned south against the weakened French army, and Paris fell to them on 14 June. Eight days later France signed an armistice with Germany; it was divided into German and Italian occupation zones, and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France kept its fleet, which the United Kingdom attacked on 3 July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany.\nThe air Battle of Britain began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours. The German campaign for air superiority started in August but its failure to defeat RAF Fighter Command forced the indefinite postponement of the proposed German invasion of Britain. The German strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on London and other cities in the Blitz, but largely ended in May 1941 after failing to significantly disrupt the British war effort.\nUsing newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British shipping in the Atlantic. The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck.\nIn November 1939, the United States was assisting China and the Western Allies, and had amended the Neutrality Act to allow \"cash and carry\" purchases by the Allies. In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased. In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases. Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. In December 1940, Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an \"arsenal of democracy\" and promoting Lend-Lease programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the British war effort; Lend-Lease was later extended to the other Allies, including the Soviet Union after it was invaded by Germany. The United States started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany.\nAt the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy, and Germany as the Axis powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country—with the exception of the Soviet Union—that attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania joined. Romania and Hungary later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=== Mediterranean (1940–1941) ===\n\nIn early June 1940, the Italian Regia Aeronautica attacked and besieged Malta, a British possession. From late summer to early autumn, Italy conquered British Somaliland and made an incursion into British-held Egypt. In October, Italy attacked Greece, but the attack was repulsed with heavy Italian casualties; the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes. To assist Italy and prevent Britain from gaining a foothold, Germany prepared to invade the Balkans, which would threaten Romanian oil fields and strike against British dominance of the Mediterranean.\n\nIn December 1940, British Empire forces began counter-offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa. The offensives were successful; by early February 1941, Italy had lost control of eastern Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission after a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan.\nItalian defeats prompted Germany to deploy an expeditionary force to North Africa; at the end of March 1941, Rommel's Afrika Korps launched an offensive which drove back Commonwealth forces. In less than a month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and besieged the port of Tobruk.\nBy late March 1941, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact; however, the Yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by pro-British nationalists. Germany and Italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both Yugoslavia and Greece, commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month. The airborne invasion of the Greek island of Crete at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans. Partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, which continued until the end of the war.\nIn the Middle East in May, Commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria. Between June and July, British-led forces invaded and occupied the French possessions of Syria and Lebanon, assisted by the Free French.\n\n\n=== Axis attack on the Soviet Union (1941) ===\n\nWith the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations for war. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany, and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941. By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.\nHitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. On 31 July 1940, Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of Ukraine, the Baltic states and Byelorussia. However, other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a Euro-Asian bloc against the British Empire by inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the pact. The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.\nOn 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them; they were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk–Astrakhan line—from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum (\"living space\") by dispossessing the native population, and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.\nAlthough the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war, Operation Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt strategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By mid-August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad. The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially-developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov).\n\nThe diversion of three-quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy. In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany and in August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter, which outlined British and American goals for the post-war world. In late August the British and Soviets invaded neutral Iran to secure the Persian Corridor, Iran's oil fields, and preempt any Axis advances through Iran toward the Baku oil fields or India.\nBy October, Axis powers had achieved operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region, with only the sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing. A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend the offensive. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended.\nBy early December, freshly mobilised reserves allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops. This, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army, allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100–250 kilometres (62–155 mi) west.\n\n\n=== War breaks out in the Pacific (1941) ===\n\nFollowing the Japanese false flag Mukden incident in 1931, the Japanese shelling of the American gunboat USS Panay in 1937, and the 1937–1938 Nanjing Massacre, Japanese-American relations deteriorated. In 1939, the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions—the Export Control Acts—which banned US exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan, and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime. During 1939 Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, but was repulsed by late September. Despite several offensives by both sides, by 1940 the war between China and Japan was at a stalemate. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina in September 1940.\nChinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940. In August, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists. Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation. In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the nationalist Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during the Battle of Shanggao. In September, Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.\nGerman successes in Europe prompted Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan with oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941. In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo. At the same time, Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East, intending to take advantage of the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.\nSince early 1941, the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate. At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them. Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any \"neighboring countries\".\n\nFrustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American–British–Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. Emperor Hirohito, after initial hesitation about Japan's chances of victory, began to favour Japan's entry into the war. As a result, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned. Hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni in his place, choosing War Minister Hideki Tojo instead. On 3 November, Nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on Pearl Harbor to the Emperor. On 5 November, Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war. On 20 November, the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange, Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina. The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers. That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force; the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.\nJapan planned to seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war. To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset. On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific. These included an attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, as well as invasions of Guam, Wake Island, Malaya, Thailand, and Hong Kong.\nThese attacks led the United States, United Kingdom, China, Australia, and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan. Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.\n\n\n=== Axis advance stalls (1942–1943) ===\nOn 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations, thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the Axis powers.\nDuring 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets demanded a second front. The British argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolstering resistance forces; Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour, without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942, and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.\nAt the Casablanca Conference in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes. Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland, and to invade France in 1944.\n\n\n=== Pacific (1942–1943) ===\n\nBy the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners. Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and US forces, the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile. On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division. Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea, Java Sea, and Indian Ocean, and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha. These easy victories over the unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, and overextended.\nIn early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. In mid-May, Japan started the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups. In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans had broken Japanese naval codes in late May and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy.\nWith its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan attempted to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua. The Americans planned a counterattack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands, primarily Guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing Rabaul, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.\nBoth plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna–Gona. Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops. In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first was a disastrous offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942 that forced a retreat back to India by May 1943. The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese frontlines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.\n\n\n=== Eastern Front (1942–1943) ===\n\nDespite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year. In May, the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov, and then in June 1942 launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy the Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.\nBy mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting. The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad, and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk.\n\n\n=== Western Europe/Atlantic and Mediterranean (1942–1943) ===\n\nExploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast. By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive in North Africa, Operation Crusader, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made. The Germans also launched a North African offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala line by early February, followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives. Concerns that the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942. An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein. On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the failed Dieppe Raid, demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.\nIn August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta. A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya. This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, which resulted in the region joining the Allies. Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France; although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces. Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943.\nIn June 1943, the British and Americans began a strategic bombing campaign against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and \"de-house\" the civilian population. The firebombing of Hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.\n\n\n=== Allies gain momentum (1943–1944) ===\n\nAfter the Guadalcanal campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and US forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians. Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands. In April, the Allies launched an operation to retake Western New Guinea.\nIn the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia. On 5 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' well-constructed defences, and for the first time in the war, Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month.\nOn 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives, thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority, giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front. The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and the Lower Dnieper Offensive.\nOn 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland, following Italy's armistice with the Allies and the ensuing German occupation of Italy. Germany, with the help of fascists, responded to the armistice by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas, and creating a series of defensive lines. German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic, causing an Italian civil war. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.\n\nGerman operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign. In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran. The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.\nFrom November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese awaited allied relief as they forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition. In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio.\nOn 27 January 1944, Soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, thereby ending the most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, Rome was captured on 4 June.\nThe Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against Allied positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British and Indian forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields. By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha.\n\n\n=== Allies close in (1944) ===\n\nOn 6 June 1944 (commonly known as D-Day), after three years of Soviet pressure, the Western Allies invaded northern France. After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France. These landings were successful and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France. Paris was liberated on 25 August by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces, both led by General Charles de Gaulle, and the Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe during the latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed. After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross the Ruhr river. In Italy, the Allied advance slowed due to the last major German defensive line.\nOn 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus (\"Operation Bagration\") that nearly destroyed the German Army Group Centre. Soon after that, another Soviet strategic offensive forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviets formed the Polish Committee of National Liberation to control territory in Poland and combat the Polish Armia Krajowa; the Soviet Red Army remained in the Praga district on the other side of the Vistula and watched passively as the Germans quelled the Warsaw Uprising initiated by the Armia Krajowa. The national uprising in Slovakia was also quelled by the Germans. The Soviet Red Army's strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful coup d'état in Romania and in Bulgaria, followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.\n\nIn September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off. By this point, the communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Soviet Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945. Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, although Finland was forced to fight their former German allies.\nBy the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam, pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In September 1944, Chinese forces captured Mount Song and reopened the Burma Road. In China, the Japanese had more successes, having finally captured Changsha in mid-June and the city of Hengyang by early August. Soon after, they invaded the province of Guangxi, winning major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the end of November and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by mid-December.\nIn the Pacific, US forces continued to push back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.\n\n\n=== Axis collapse and Allied victory (1944–1945) ===\n\nOn 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt to split the Allies on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French-German border, hoping to encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port at Antwerp. By 16 January 1945, this offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Red Army attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia. On 4 February Soviet, British, and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan.\nIn February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while the Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B. In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and retake Budapest, Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet troops near Lake Balaton. Within two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to Vienna, and captured the city. In early April, Soviet troops captured Königsberg, while the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April, leaving unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin.\nSoviet troops stormed and captured Berlin in late April. In Italy, German forces surrendered on 29 April, while the Italian Social Republic capitulated two days later. On 30 April, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.\nMajor changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period. On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice president, Harry S. Truman. Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April. On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in his headquarters, and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz (as President of the Reich) and Joseph Goebbels (as Chancellor of the Reich); Goebbels also committed suicide on the following day and was replaced by Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, in what would later be known as the Flensburg Government. Total and unconditional surrender in Europe was signed on 7 and 8 May, to be effective by the end of 8 May. German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May. On 23 May all remaining members of the German government were arrested by the Allied Forces in Flensburg, while on 5 June all German political and military institutions were transferred under the control of the Allies through the Berlin Declaration.\nIn the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of the Philippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines, clearing Leyte by the end of April 1945. They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and recaptured Manila in March. Fighting continued on Luzon, Mindanao, and other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war. Meanwhile, the United States Army Air Forces launched a massive firebombing campaign of strategic cities in Japan in an effort to destroy Japanese war industry and civilian morale. A devastating bombing raid on Tokyo of 9–10 March was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history.\n\nIn May 1945, Australian troops landed in Borneo, overrunning the oilfields there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March, and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May. Chinese forces started a counterattack in the Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa by the end of June. At the same time, a naval blockade by submarines was strangling Japan's economy and drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces.\nOn 11 July, Allied leaders met in Potsdam, Germany. They confirmed earlier agreements about Germany, and the American, British and Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of Japan, specifically stating that \"the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction\". During this conference, the United Kingdom held its general election, and Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as Prime Minister.\nThe call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the Japanese government, which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms. In early August, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, declared war on Japan, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting force. These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms. The Red Army also captured the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On the night of 9–10 August 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced his decision to accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the Potsdam Declaration. On 15 August, the Emperor communicated this decision to the Japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio (Gyokuon-hōsō, literally \"broadcast in the Emperor's voice\"). On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay on the deck of the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and Germany, both initially divided between western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, respectively. However, their paths soon diverged. In Germany, the western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union officially ended in 1949, with the respective zones becoming separate countries, West Germany and East Germany. In Austria, however, occupation continued until 1955, when a joint settlement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union permitted the reunification of Austria as a democratic state officially non-aligned with any political bloc (although in practice having better relations with the Western Allies). A denazification program in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the Nuremberg trials and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.\nGermany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern territories, Silesia, Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland, and East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, followed by the expulsion to Germany of the nine million Germans from these provinces, as well as three million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon Line, from which two million Poles were expelled. North-east Romania, parts of eastern Finland, and the Baltic states were annexed into the Soviet Union. Italy lost its monarchy, colonial empire, and some European territories.\nIn an effort to maintain world peace, the Allies formed the United Nations, which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations. The great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States—became the permanent members of the UN's Security Council. The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state, the Russian Federation, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.\n\nBesides Germany, the rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the Soviet Union. A Communist uprising in Greece was put down with Anglo-American support and the country remained aligned with the West.\nPost-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The long period of political tensions and military competition between them—the Cold War—would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the world.\nIn Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administered Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. Korea, formerly under Japanese colonial rule, was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the United States in the South between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the Korean War.\nIn China, nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab–Israeli conflict. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.\nThe global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy. The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany from 1945 to 1948. Due to international trade interdependencies, this policy led to an economic stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for several years.\nAt the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944, the Allied nations drew up an economic framework for the post-war world. The agreement created the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which later became part of the World Bank Group. The Bretton Woods system lasted until 1973. Recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the US Marshall Plan economic aid (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused. The post-1948 West German recovery has been called the German economic miracle. Italy also experienced an economic boom and the French economy rebounded. By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin, and although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country, it continued in relative economic decline for decades. The Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era, having seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and exacted war reparations from its satellite states. Japan recovered much later. China returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Casualties and war crimes ===\n\nEstimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded. Most suggest 60 million people died, about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.\nThe Soviet Union alone lost around 27 million people during the war, including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths. A quarter of the total people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed. Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.\nAn estimated 11 to 17 million civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of Hitler's racist policies, including mass killing of around 6 million Jews, along with Roma, homosexuals, at least 1.9 million ethnic Poles and millions of other Slavs (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), and other ethnic and minority groups. Between 1941 and 1945, more than 200,000 ethnic Serbs, along with Roma and Jews, were persecuted and murdered by the Axis-aligned Croatian Ustaše in Yugoslavia. Concurrently, Muslims and Croats were persecuted and killed by Serb nationalist Chetniks, with an estimated 50,000–68,000 victims (of which 41,000 were civilians). Also, more than 100,000 Poles were massacred by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the Volhynia massacres, between 1943 and 1945. At the same time, about 10,000–15,000 Ukrainians were killed by the Polish Home Army and other Polish units, in reprisal attacks.\n\nIn Asia and the Pacific, the number of people killed by Japanese troops remains contested. According to R.J. Rummel, the Japanese killed between 3 million and more than 10 million people, with the most probable case of almost 6,000,000 people. According to the British historian M. R. D. Foot, civilian deaths are between 10 million and 20 million, whereas Chinese military casualties (killed and wounded) are estimated to be over five million. Other estimates say that up to 30 million people, most of them civilians, were killed. The most infamous Japanese atrocity was the Nanjing Massacre, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered. Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the Three Alls policy. General Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Hebei and Shandong.\nAxis forces employed biological and chemical weapons. The Imperial Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of China (see Unit 731) and in early conflicts against the Soviets. Both the Germans and the Japanese tested such weapons against civilians, and sometimes on prisoners of war.\nThe Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish officers, and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD secret police, along with mass civilian deportations to Siberia, in the Baltic states and eastern Poland annexed by the Red Army. Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially in Germany. The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million, while figures for women raped by German soldiers in the Soviet Union go as far as ten million.\nThe mass bombing of cities in Europe and Asia has often been called a war crime, although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during World War II. The USAAF bombed a total of 67 Japanese cities, killing 393,000 civilians, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and destroying 65% of built-up areas.\n\n\n=== Genocide, concentration camps, and slave labour ===\n\nNazi Germany, under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, was responsible for murdering about 6 million Jews in what is now known as the Holocaust. They also murdered an additional 4 million others who were deemed \"unworthy of life\" (including the disabled and mentally ill, Soviet prisoners of war, Romani, homosexuals, Freemasons, and Jehovah's Witnesses) as part of a program of deliberate extermination, in effect becoming a \"genocidal state\". Soviet POWs were kept in especially unbearable conditions, and 3.6 million Soviet POWs out of 5.7 million died in Nazi camps during the war. In addition to concentration camps, death camps were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale. Nazi Germany extensively used forced labourers; about 12 million Europeans from German-occupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German industry, agriculture and war economy.\n\nThe Soviet Gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during 1942–1943, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates, including foreign citizens of Poland and other countries occupied in 1939–1940 by the Soviet Union, as well as Axis POWs. By the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to NKVD evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators.\nJapanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 percent (for American POWs, 37 percent), seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56.\nAt least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or Kōain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In Java, between 4 and 10 million rōmusha (Japanese: \"manual labourers\"), were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in Southeast Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\n\n\n=== Occupation ===\n\nIn Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks (27.8 billion US dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods. Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.\n\nIn the East, the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders. Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the \"inferior people\" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes. The Nazis killed an estimated 2.8 million ethnic Poles in addition to Polish-Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East or the West until late 1943.\nIn Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples. Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination, Japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them. During Japan's initial conquest, it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m3) of oil (~550,000 tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces; and by 1943, was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (7,900,000 m3) of oil (~6.8 million tonnes), 76 percent of its 1940 output rate.\n\n\n=== Home fronts and production ===\n\nIn the 1930s Britain and the United States together controlled almost 75% of world mineral output—essential for projecting military power.\nIn Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); including colonies, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP. In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this reduces to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.\nThe United States produced about two-thirds of all munitions used by the Allies in World War II, including warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition. Although the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies and the war evolved into one of attrition. While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis was partly due to more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so. To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers; Germany enslaved about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.\n\n\n=== Advances in technology and its application ===\n\nAircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role developed considerably. Innovations included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war). Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.\nAdvances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship (in place of the battleship). In the Atlantic, escort carriers became a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap. Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured. Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War, were expected by all combatants to be important in the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics. Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh Light, Hedgehog, Squid, and homing torpedoes proved effective against German submarines.\n\nLand warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon. In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower. At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications. This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France. Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used. Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I. The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German MG 34, and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings. The assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard post-war infantry weapon for most armed forces.\nMost major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well-known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma that benefited from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another component of military intelligence was deception, which the Allies used to great effect in operations such as Mincemeat and Bodyguard.\nOther technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research, the development of artificial harbours, and oil pipelines under the English Channel. Penicillin was first developed, mass-produced, and used during the war.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreatest Generation\nOpposition to World War II\nWorld War III\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBuchanan, Andrew (7 February 2023). \"Globalizing the Second World War\".

        "title": "Kingdom (2025 film)",
        "content": "Kingdom is a 2025 Indian Telugu-language action thriller film written and directed by Gowtam Tinnanuri. Co-produced by Naga Vamsi and Sai Soujanya under the banners of Sithara Entertainments and Fortune Four Cinemas, the film stars Vijay Deverakonda alongside Satyadev and Bhagyashri Borse. It is intended to be the first installment of a planned duology, and follows a troubled police officer who is assigned to go undercover on a case that brings him face-to-face with his past demons.\nThe film was officially announced in January 2023 under the tentative title VD12, and the official title was announced in February 2025. Principal photography commenced in June 2023. Filming took place in Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Kerala and Sri Lanka. The film has music composed by Anirudh Ravichander, cinematography handled by Girish Gangadharan with Jomon T. John and editing by Naveen Nooli.\nKingdom was released worldwide on 31 July 2025 to mixed reviews from critics and audience. The film grossed ₹82.02 crore worldwide and underperformed at the box office, becoming an average grosser.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1920 Srikakulam, a group of tribals along with their king, try to stop the massacre of their people by the British, for mining gold. However, they are unsuccessful in doing so and their king dies without telling the survivors of the massacre about a prophesied descendant of their tribe. In 1991, Constable Surya \"Suri\", a young and aggressive, but well-mannered police officer who, after being separated from his elder brother, Siva, during their childhood, is recruited by a spy handler, JP, to go on an undercover mission.\nHis objective is to infiltrate the heavily fortified island off of Sri Lanka, known as \"Divi\", in the midst of the Sri Lankan civil war. He accomplishes this by instigating a brawl during a temple festival and getting himself arrested and sent to the island's prison, a place notorious for its brutal and lawless conditions. Upon his arrival, Suri is shocked to find that his long-lost brother, Siva, is the leader of the descendants of the tribe from 1920 who have relocated to Divi to escape the British. The two brothers, now on opposite sides of a brewing conflict, are reunited under tense and dangerous circumstances.\nSuri's mission becomes more complex as he struggles to balance his loyalty to his country and his newfound connection with his brother. He gains favor within the prison's hierarchy and the trust of Siva. During a critical moment, Suri is tasked with a dangerous operation to retrieve a massive gold haul from the occupying Sri Lankan army. His success in this mission makes him a celebrated figure among the island's residents and strengthens his position.\nHowever, the island's main leader, Murugan, who is part of the Sri Lankan cartel and comes from a Tamil-speaking family that rules over the residents with an iron fist, grows suspicious of Suri.

The production was reportedly set to begin after Charan completes his commitments for Acharya and RRR (2022). The project was officially announced on 15 October 2021, tentatively titled RC15. It would be funded by UV Creations, in association with NVR Cinema. The following August, however, it was reported that the project was shelved due to reasons unknown. That November, it was officially confirmed to have been shelved with no reasons being stated. Gowtam then reportedly visited Vijay Deverakonda and narrated the same script which also impressed the actor.\nThe film would be funded by Suryadevara Naga Vamsi and Sai Soujanya, under Sithara Entertainments, Fortune Four Creations, and Srikara Studios. The company made a public announcement on 13 January 2023, confirming the project. In January 2025, Naga Vamsi announced that the film would be released in two parts. The film's official title as Kingdom was announced on 12 February 2025.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nIn June 2023, principal photography commenced in Hyderabad. However, filming was delayed due to Vijay's ongoing commitments, Kushi and The Family Star. Filming resumed in April 2024 in Visakhapatnam with a month-long schedule. The third schedule commenced in July 2024 in Sri Lanka with 60% of the filming completed. Filming then began in areas Kothamangalam, Thandikudi and Nagercoil. In September 2024, the fourth schedule commenced in Kerala. In November 2024, Devarakonda suffered a minor shoulder injury on sets. As of January 2025, 80% of the filming was completed.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by Anirudh Ravichander, in his second collaboration with Gowtam Tinnanuri after Jersey (2019) and first collaboration with Devarakonda. The audio rights were acquired by Aditya Music.\nThe title teaser theme \"Kingdom Teaser OST\" was released on 17 March 2025. The first single, titled \"Hridayam Lopala\", was released on 2 May 2025. The second single, titled \"Anna Antene\", was released on 16 July 2025.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nKingdom was released worldwide on 31 July 2025 in Telugu along with dubbed versions in Tamil and Hindi. The film was originally scheduled to be released worldwide on 28 March 2025, but was later postponed due to unfinished production work. The film was again rescheduled to release on 30 May 2025, but was postponed again. A new release date was announced as 4 July 2025, but was delayed again due to undisclosed reason.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nOn 12 February 2025, the makers unveiled the film's teaser on social media platforms. The teaser features voice overs by N. T. Rama Rao Jr. in Telugu along with voice overs by Suriya and Ranbir Kapoor in Tamil and Hindi respectively. The film's trailer was released on 26 July 2025.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe digital distribution rights of the film were acquired by Netflix. The film began streaming on the platform from 27 August 2025 in Telugu and dubbed versions of Hindi, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam languages. This version, however, was edited and particularly removed a carnival fight sequence to maintain a pace and flow in the storyline for the viewers.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKingdom received generally mixed reviews from critics with praise towards performances (especially Vijay and Satyadev's), cinematography, action set pieces, and Anirudh's background score but criticised the inconsistent narrative and screenplay, rushed second half, and lack of emotional depth in the story.\nAvad Mohammad of OTTPlay rated the film 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Kingdom does not live up to all the hype created. Kingdom has scale and style, but it misses out on the much-needed emotions in the narrative.\" BH Harsh of Cinema Express rated 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Kingdom is an ambitious failure, somewhat admirable but largely underwhelming.\" Swaroop Kodur of The Indian Express rated with 2.5/5 stars and wrote \"Kingdom never truly tethers us emotionally to its story. Though the film juggles many elements, it never settles on a central thread to bring them into harmony.\"\nBVS Prakash of Deccan Chronicle rated with 1.5/5 stars and wrote \"Director Gautam Tinnanuri, best known for the emotionally rich Jersey, struggles to replicate that magic in this overly ambitious tale. His attempt to spotlight the plight of Andhra fishermen is noble in intent but lacks emotional weight and authenticity. The foreign setting further alienates the audience, and the script never finds its footing.\" Satya Pulagam of ABP Live gave 1.5/5 stars and wrote \"'Kingdom' is not built on new ideas or scenes. From start to finish, it evokes memories of earlier films, 'Chhatrapati', 'Aayirathil Oruvan', and eventually, 'KGF'.\nBalakrishna Ganeshan of The News Minute wrote \"While Gowtham Tinnanuri’s ‘Kingdom’ is highly ambitious, it forgets what makes storytelling compelling: clarity, character, and connection.\" Sruthi Ganapathy Raman of The Hollywood Reporter India wrote \"With the story of another brother looming in the shadows, the hope is for the film to find its redemption soon.\"\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nKingdom faced criticism from the Tamil-speaking community for its depiction of Sri Lankan Tamils. The portrayal was widely condemned as insensitive, with critics highlighting the ongoing impact of the Tamil genocide in Sri Lanka. The film was accused of misrepresenting a historically persecuted group, leading to online backlash, including calls for both a boycott and a ban of the film in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\n== Future ==\nFollowing the theatrical release of Kingdom on 31 July 2025, Gowtam Tinnanuri said that the film was envisioned as part of a larger Kingdom universe. Instead of moving immediately to a sequel, the makers announced that a standalone OTT prequel focusing on the character Sethu was in development. The prequel is intended to expand the narrative and serve as a bridge to the sequel. Tinnanuri also stated that Kingdom: Part 2 remains in the pipeline and will follow after the prequel. In addition, discussions have taken place about a potential third film, set in the 1920s, though this project has not been finalised.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKingdom at IMDb",

        "title": "United States",
        "content": "The United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It is a federal republic of 50 states and a federal capital district, Washington, D.C. The 48 contiguous states border Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, with the semi-exclave of Alaska in the northwest and the archipelago of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. The United States also asserts sovereignty over five major island territories and various uninhabited islands in Oceania and the Caribbean. It is a megadiverse country, with the world's third-largest land area and third-largest population, exceeding 340 million.\nPaleo-Indians migrated from North Asia to North America over 12,000 years ago, and formed various civilizations. Spanish colonization established Spanish Florida in 1513, the first European colony in what is now the continental United States. British colonization followed with the 1607 settlement of Virginia, the first of the Thirteen Colonies. Forced migration of enslaved Africans supplied the labor force to sustain the Southern Colonies' plantation economy. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and lack of parliamentary representation sparked the American Revolution, leading to the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. Victory in the 1775–1783 Revolutionary War brought international recognition of U.S. sovereignty and fueled westward expansion, dispossessing native inhabitants. As more states were admitted, a North–South division over slavery led the Confederate States of America to attempt secession and fight the Union in the 1861–1865 American Civil War. With the United States' victory and reunification, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1900, the country had established itself as a great power, a status solidified after its involvement in World War I. Following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Its aftermath left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as rival superpowers, competing for ideological dominance and international influence during the Cold War. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.\nThe U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional federal republic and representative democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives (a lower house based on population) and the Senate (an upper house based on equal representation for each state). Federalism grants substantial autonomy to the 50 states. In addition, 574 Native American tribes have sovereignty rights, and there are 326 Native American reservations. Since the 1850s, the Democratic and Republican parties have dominated American politics, while American values are based on a democratic tradition inspired by the American Enlightenment movement. \nA developed country, the U.S. ranks high in economic competitiveness, innovation, and higher education. Accounting for over a quarter of nominal global economic output, its economy has been the world's largest since about 1890. It is the wealthiest country, with the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD members, though its wealth inequality is one of the most pronounced in those countries. Shaped by centuries of immigration, the culture of the U.S. is diverse and globally influential. Making up more than a third of global military spending, the country has one of the strongest militaries and is a designated nuclear state. A member of numerous international organizations, the U.S. plays a major role in global political, cultural, economic, and military affairs.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nDocumented use of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to January 2, 1776. On that day, Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, wrote a letter to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp, seeking to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort. The first known public usage is an anonymous essay published in the Williamsburg newspaper The Virginia Gazette on April 6, 1776. Sometime on or after June 11, 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote \"United States of America\" in a rough draft of the Declaration of Independence, which was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.\nThe term \"United States\" and its initialism \"U.S.\", used as nouns or as adjectives in English, are common short names for the country. The initialism \"USA\", a noun, is also common. \"United States\" and \"U.S.\" are the established terms throughout the U.S. federal government, with prescribed rules. \"The States\" is an established colloquial shortening of the name, used particularly from abroad; \"stateside\" is the corresponding adjective or adverb.\n\"America\" is the feminine form of the first word of Americus Vesputius, the Latinized name of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci (1454–1512); it was first used as a place name by the German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann in 1507. Vespucci first proposed that the West Indies discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 were part of a previously unknown landmass and not among the Indies at the eastern limit of Asia. In English, the term \"America\" usually does not refer to topics unrelated to the United States, despite the usage of \"the Americas\" to describe the totality of the continents of North and South America.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\n\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia over 12,000 years ago, either across the Bering land bridge or along the now-submerged Ice Age coastline. The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas. Over time, Indigenous North American cultures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture, developed agriculture, architecture, and complex societies. In the post-archaic period, the Mississippian cultures were located in the midwestern, eastern, and southern regions, and the Algonquian in the Great Lakes region and along the Eastern Seaboard, while the Hohokam culture and Ancestral Puebloans inhabited the southwest. Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000 to nearly 10 million.\n\n\n=== European exploration, colonization and conflict (1513–1765) ===\n\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean for Spain in 1492, leading to Spanish-speaking settlements and missions from what are now Puerto Rico and Florida to New Mexico and California. The first Spanish colony in the present-day continental United States was Spanish Florida, chartered in 1513. After several settlements failed there due to hunger and disease, Spain's first permanent town, Saint Augustine, was founded in 1565. \nFrance established its own settlements in French Florida in 1562, but they were either abandoned (Charlesfort, 1578) or destroyed by Spanish raids (Fort Caroline, 1565). Permanent French settlements were founded much later along the Great Lakes (Fort Detroit, 1701), the Mississippi River (Saint Louis, 1764) and especially the Gulf of Mexico (New Orleans, 1718). Early European colonies also included the thriving Dutch colony of New Nederland (settled 1626, present-day New York) and the small Swedish colony of New Sweden (settled 1638 in what is now Delaware). British colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and the Plymouth Colony (Massachusetts, 1620).\nThe Mayflower Compact in Massachusetts and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-governance and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies. While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts. Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres. The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to Christianity. Along the eastern seaboard, settlers trafficked African slaves through the Atlantic slave trade.\nThe original Thirteen Colonies that would later found the United States were administered as possessions of the British Empire by Crown-appointed governors, though local governments held  elections open to most white male property owners. The colonial population grew rapidly from Maine to Georgia, eclipsing Native American populations; by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain facilitated the entrenchment of self-governance, and the First Great Awakening, a series of Christian revivals, fueled colonial interest in guaranteed religious liberty.\n\n\n=== American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800) ===\n\nFollowing their victory in the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, resulting in colonial political resistance; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their rights as Englishmen, particularly the right to representation in the British government that taxed them. To demonstrate their dissatisfaction and resolve, the First Continental Congress met in 1774 and passed the Continental Association, a colonial boycott of British goods that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and created a committee that named Thomas Jefferson to draft the Declaration of Independence. Two days after passing the Lee Resolution to create an independent nation the Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776. The political values of the American Revolution included liberty, inalienable individual rights; and the sovereignty of the people; supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy, aristocracy, and all hereditary political power; civic virtue; and vilification of political corruption. The Founding Fathers of the United States, who included Washington, Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and many others, were inspired by Classical, Renaissance, and Enlightenment philosophies and ideas.\nThough in practical effect since its drafting in 1777, the Articles of Confederation was ratified in 1781 and formally established a decentralized government that operated until 1789. After the British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Paris (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida. The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the admission of new states, rather than the expansion of existing states. \nThe U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention to overcome the limitations of the Articles. It went into effect in 1789, creating a federal republic governed by three separate branches that together ensured a system of checks and balances. George Washington was elected the country's first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay skeptics' concerns about the power of the more centralized government. His resignation as commander-in-chief after the Revolutionary War and his later refusal to run for a third term as the country's first president established a precedent for the supremacy of civil authority in the United States and the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\n=== Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865) ===\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward in larger numbers, many with a sense of manifest destiny. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States. Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw. Spain ceded Florida and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.\nThe Missouri Compromise of 1820, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, attempted to balance the desire of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery into new territories with that of southern states to extend it there. Primarily, the compromise prohibited slavery in all other lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36°30′ parallel.\nAs Americans expanded further into territory inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government implemented policies of Indian removal or assimilation. The most significant such legislation was the Indian Removal Act of 1830, a key policy of President Andrew Jackson. It resulted in the Trail of Tears (1830–1850), in which an estimated 60,000 Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River were forcibly removed and displaced to lands far to the west, causing 13,200 to 16,700 deaths along the forced march. Settler expansion as well as this influx of Indigenous peoples from the East resulted in the American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi.\nThe United States annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845, and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Dispute with Mexico over Texas led to the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). After the victory of the U.S., Mexico recognized U.S sovereignty over Texas, New Mexico, and California in the 1848 Mexican Cession; the cession's lands also included the future states of Nevada, Colorado and Utah. The California gold rush of 1848–1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the California genocide of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the mid-1870s. Additional western territories and states were created.\n\nDuring the colonial period, slavery had been legal in the American colonies, becoming the main labor force in the large-scale, agriculture-dependent economies of the Southern Colonies from Maryland to Georgia. The practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution,  and spurred by an active abolitionist movement that had reemerged in the 1830s, states in the North enacted laws to prohibit slavery within their boundaries. At the same time, support for slavery had strengthened in Southern states, with widespread use of inventions such as the cotton gin (1793) having made slavery immensely profitable for Southern elites. \nThroughout the 1850s, this sectional conflict regarding slavery was further inflamed by national legislation in the U.S. Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court. In Congress, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 mandated the forcible return to their owners in the South of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states, while the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise. In its Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Supreme Court ruled against a slave brought into non-slave territory, simultaneously declaring the entire Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. These and other events exacerbated tensions between North and South that would culminate in the American Civil War (1861–1865).\nBeginning with South Carolina, 11 slave-state governments voted to secede from the United States in 1861, joining to create the Confederate States of America. All other state governments remained loyal to the Union. War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter. Following the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, many freed slaves joined the Union army. The war began to turn in the Union's favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg, and the Confederates surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House.\n\n\n=== Reconstruction, Gilded Age, and Progressive Era (1863–1917) ===\n\nEfforts toward reconstruction in the secessionist South had begun as early as 1862, but it was only after President Lincoln's assassination that the three Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution were ratified to protect civil rights. The amendments codified nationally the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for crimes, promised equal protection under the law for all persons, and prohibited discrimination on the basis of race or previous enslavement. As a result, African Americans took an active political role in ex-Confederate states in the decade following the Civil War. The former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union, beginning with Tennessee in 1866 and ending with Georgia in 1870.\nNational infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads, spurred growth in the American frontier. This was accelerated by the Homestead Acts, through which nearly 10 percent of the total land area of the United States was given away free to some 1.6 million homesteaders. From 1865 through 1917, an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe. Most came through the Port of New York, and New York City and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations. Many Northern Europeans as well as significant numbers of Germans and other Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England. During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.\nThe Compromise of 1877 is generally considered the end of the Reconstruction era, as it resolved the electoral crisis following the 1876 presidential election and led President Rutherford B. Hayes to reduce the role of federal troops in the South. Immediately, the Redeemers began evicting the Carpetbaggers and quickly regained local control of Southern politics in the name of white supremacy. African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations. A series of Supreme Court decisions, including Plessy v. Ferguson, emptied the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of their force, allowing Jim Crow laws in the South to remain unchecked, sundown towns in the Midwest, and segregation in communities across the country, which would be reinforced by the policy of redlining later adopted by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation.\nAn explosion of technological advancement accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor led to rapid economic expansion during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, allowing the United States to outpace the economies of England, France, and Germany combined. This fostered the amassing of power by a few prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition. Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. The United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry. These changes resulted in significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, creating the environment for labor unions and socialist movements to begin to flourish. This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.\nPro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. That same year, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam were ceded to the U.S. by Spain after the latter's defeat in the Spanish–American War. (The Philippines was granted full independence from the U.S. on July 4, 1946, following World War II. Puerto Rico and Guam have remained U.S. territories.) American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War. The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.\n\n\n=== World War I, Great Depression, and World War II (1917–1945) ===\n\nThe United States entered World War I alongside the Allies in 1917 helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage. During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and early television transformed communications nationwide. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, to which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal plan of \"reform, recovery and relief\", a series of unprecedented and sweeping recovery programs and employment relief projects combined with financial reforms and regulations.\nInitially neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war in December after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war. The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the post-war world, alongside the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China. The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic power and international political influence.\n\n\n=== Cold War and social revolution (1945–1991) ===\n\nThe end of World War II in 1945 left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as superpowers, each with its own political, military, and economic sphere of influence. Geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers soon led to the Cold War. The U.S. utilized the policy of containment to limit the USSR's sphere of influence, engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with Moscow, and prevailed in the Space Race, which culminated with the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.\nDomestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II. The civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s. The Great Society plan of President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration resulted in groundbreaking and broad-reaching laws, policies and a constitutional amendment to counteract some of the worst effects of lingering institutional racism.\nThe counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes toward recreational drug use and sexuality. It also encouraged open defiance of the military draft (leading to the end of conscription in 1973) and wide opposition to U.S. intervention in Vietnam, with the U.S. totally withdrawing in 1975. A societal shift in the roles of women was significantly responsible for the large increase in female paid labor participation during the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of American women aged 16 and older were employed.\nThe Fall of Communism and the dissolution of the Soviet Union from 1989 to 1991 marked the end of the Cold War and left the United States as the world's sole superpower. This cemented the United States' global influence, reinforcing the concept of the \"American Century\" as the U.S. dominated international political, cultural, economic, and military affairs.\n\n\n=== Contemporary (1991–present) ===\n\nThe 1990s saw the longest recorded economic expansion in American history, a dramatic decline in U.S. crime rates, and advances in technology. Throughout this decade, technological innovations such as the World Wide Web, the evolution of the Pentium microprocessor in accordance with Moore's law, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the first gene therapy trial, and cloning either emerged in the U.S. or were improved upon there. The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990, while Nasdaq became the first stock market in the United States to trade online in 1998.\nIn the Gulf War of 1991, an American-led international coalition of states expelled an Iraqi invasion force that had occupied neighboring Kuwait. The September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 by the pan-Islamist militant organization al-Qaeda led to the war on terror and subsequent military interventions in Afghanistan and in Iraq. \nThe U.S. housing bubble culminated in 2007 with the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression. In the 2010s and early 2020s, the United States has experienced increased political polarization and democratic backsliding. The country's polarization was violently reflected in the January 2021 Capitol attack, when a mob of insurrectionists entered the U.S. Capitol and sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power in an attempted self-coup d'état.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe United States is the world's third-largest country by total area behind Russia and Canada. The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia have a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2). In 2021, the United States had 8% of the Earth's permanent meadows and pastures and 10% of its cropland.\nStarting in the east, the coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region. The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack Massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi River System, the world's fourth-longest river system, runs predominantly north–south through the center of the country. The flat and fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rocky Mountains, the Yellowstone Caldera, is the continent's largest volcanic feature. Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts. In the northwest corner of Arizona, carved by the Colorado River, is the Grand Canyon, a steep-sided canyon and popular tourist destination known for its overwhelming visual size and intricate, colorful landscape. The Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the State of California, about 84 miles (135 km) apart.\nAt an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali (also called Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and on the continent. Active volcanoes in the U.S. are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands. Located entirely outside North America, the archipelago of Hawaii consists of volcanic islands, physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWith its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii, the southern tip of Florida and U.S. territories in the Caribbean and Pacific are tropical.\nThe United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country. States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley. Due to climate change in the country, extreme weather has become more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves compared to the 1960s. Since the 1990s, droughts in the American Southwest have become more persistent and more severe. The regions considered as the most attractive to the population are the most vulnerable.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity and conservation ===\n\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians, and around 91,000 insect species.\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed monuments, forests, and wilderness areas, administered by the National Park Service and other agencies. About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed, primarily in the Western States. Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for commercial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biodiversity, logging and deforestation, and climate change. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act. In 2024, the U.S. ranked 35th among 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nThe United States is a federal republic of 50 states and a federal capital district, Washington, D.C. The U.S. asserts sovereignty over five unincorporated territories and several uninhabited island possessions. It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and its presidential system of national government has been adopted, in whole or in part, by many newly independent states worldwide following their decolonization. The Constitution of the United States serves as the country's supreme legal document. Most scholars describe the United States as a liberal democracy.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nComposed of three branches, all headquartered in Washington, D.C., the federal government is the national government of the United States. The U.S. Constitution establishes a separation of powers intended to provide a system of checks and balances to prevent any of the three branches from becoming supreme.\n\nThe U.S. Congress is a bicameral legislature made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate has 100 members—two residents from each state and elected by that state's voters for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members, elected for a two-year term by the constituency of the congressional district where they reside. A state's legislature decides the district boundaries, which are contiguous within the state. Every U.S. congressional district is of equivalent population and sends one representative to Congress. Election years for senators are staggered so that only one-third of them will be up for election every two years. U.S. representatives are all up for election at the same time every two years. The U.S. Congress makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse, and has the power of impeachment. One of its foremost non-legislative functions is the power to investigate and oversee the executive branch. Congressional oversight is usually delegated to committees and is facilitated by Congress's power to issue subpoenas. Much of the work of Congress is performed by a collection of committees, each appointed for a specific purpose or function. Committee membership is by tradition and statute bipartisan.\n\nThe U.S. president is the head of state, commander-in-chief of the military, chief executive of the federal government, and has the ability to veto legislative bills from the U.S. Congress before they become law. However, presidential vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds supermajority vote in both chambers of Congress. The president appoints the members of the Cabinet, subject to Senate approval, and names other officials who administer and enforce federal law and policy through their respective agencies. The president also has clemency power for federal crimes and can issue pardons. Finally, the president has the right to issue expansive \"executive orders\", subject to judicial review, in a number of policy areas. Candidates for president campaign with a vice-presidential running mate. Both candidates are elected together, or defeated together, in a presidential election. Unlike other votes in American politics, this is technically an indirect election in which the winner will be determined by the U.S. Electoral College. There, votes are officially cast by individual electors selected by their state legislature. In practice, however, each of the 50 states chooses a group of presidential electors who are required by state law to confirm the winner of their state's popular vote. Each state is allocated two electors plus one additional elector for each congressional district in the state, which in effect combines to equal the number of elected officials that state sends to Congress. The District of Columbia, with no representatives or senators, is allocated three electoral votes. Both the president and the vice president serve a four-year term, and the president may be reelected to the office only once, for one additional four-year term.\nThe U.S. federal judiciary, whose judges are all appointed for life by the president with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. courts of appeals, and the U.S. district courts. The lowest level in the federal judiciary is the federal district court, which decides all cases considered to be under \"original jurisdiction\", such as federal statutes, constitutional law, or international treaties. After a federal district court has decided a case, its decision may be contested and sent to a higher court, a federal court of appeals. The U.S. judicial system's 12 federal circuits divide the country into separate administrative regions for appeals decisions. The next and highest court in the system is the Supreme Court of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturns those it finds unconstitutional. On average, the Supreme Court receives about 7,000 appeals petitions for writs of certiorari each year, but only grants about 80. Consisting of nine members led by the Chief Justice of the United States, the court judges each case before it by majority decision. As with all other federal judges, the members are appointed for life by the sitting president with Senate approval when a vacancy becomes available.\nThe three-branch system is known as the presidential system, in contrast to the parliamentary system where the executive is part of the legislative body. Many countries around the world adopted this aspect of the 1789 Constitution of the United States, especially in the postcolonial Americas.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\nIn the U.S. federal system, sovereign powers are shared between three levels of government specified in the Constitution: the national government, the states, and Indian tribes. The U.S. also asserts sovereignty over five permanently inhabited territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nResidents of the 50 states are governed by their elected state government, and by elected local governments that are administrative divisions of a state. States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and (except for Hawaii) further divided into municipalities, each administered by elected representatives. The District of Columbia is a federal district containing the U.S. capital, Washington, D.C. The federal district is an administrative division of the federal government.\n\nIndian country is made up of 574 federally recognized tribes and 326 Indian reservations. They hold a government-to-government relationship with the U.S. federal government in Washington and are legally defined as domestic dependent nations with inherent tribal sovereignty rights.\nIn addition to the five major territories, the U.S. also asserts sovereignty over the United States Minor Outlying Islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. The seven undisputed islands without permanent populations are Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll. U.S. sovereignty over the unpopulated Bajo Nuevo Bank, Navassa Island, Serranilla Bank, and Wake Island is disputed.\n\n\n=== Political parties ===\n\nThe Constitution is silent on political parties. However, they developed independently in the 18th century with the Federalist and Anti-Federalist parties. Since then, the United States has operated as a de facto two-party system, though the parties have changed over time. Since the mid-19th century, the two main national parties have been the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The former is perceived as relatively liberal in its political platform while the latter is perceived as relatively conservative in its platform.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, with the world's second-largest diplomatic corps as of 2024. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and home to the United Nations headquarters. The United States is a member of the G7, G20, and OECD intergovernmental organizations. Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all countries host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran, North Korea, and Bhutan. Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations. The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression. Its geopolitical attention also turned to the Indo-Pacific when the United States joined the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with Australia, India, and Japan.\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom and strong ties with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Israel, and several European Union countries such as France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland. The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with countries in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States. The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association. It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India, while its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.\nBeginning in 2014, the U.S. had become a key ally of Ukraine. After Donald Trump was elected U.S. president in 2024, he sought to negotiate an end to the Russo-Ukrainian War. He paused all military aid to Ukraine in March 2025, although the aid resumed later. Trump also ended U.S. intelligence sharing with the country, but this too was eventually restored.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe president is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.\nThe United States spent $997 billion on its military in 2024, which is by far the largest amount of any country, making up 37% of global military spending and accounting for 3.4% of the country's GDP. The U.S. possesses 42% of the world's nuclear weapons—the second-largest stockpile after that of Russia. The U.S. military is widely regarded as the most powerful and advanced in the world.\nThe United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces. The U.S. military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad, and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries. The United States has engaged in over 400 military interventions since its founding in 1776, with over half of these occurring between 1950 and 2019 and 25% occurring in the post-Cold War era.\nState defense forces (SDFs) are military units that operate under the sole authority of a state government. SDFs are authorized by state and federal law but are under the command of the state's governor.\nThey are distinct from the state's National Guard units in that they are under the dual control of both the state and federal government, and also cannot become federalized entities. A state's National Guard personnel, however, can be federalized by the president under the National Defense Act Amendments of 1933, which created the Guard and provides for the integration of Army National Guard & Air National Guard units and personnel into the U.S. Army and (since 1947) the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\n=== Law enforcement and criminal justice ===\n\nThere are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to national level in the United States. Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff departments in their municipal or county jurisdictions. The state police departments have authority in their respective state, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have national jurisdiction and specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security, enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws, and interstate criminal activity. State courts conduct almost all civil and criminal trials, while federal courts adjudicate the much smaller number of civil and criminal cases that relate to federal law.\nThere is no unified \"criminal justice system\" in the United States. The American prison system is largely heterogenous, with thousands of relatively independent systems operating across federal, state, local, and tribal levels. In 2025, \"these systems hold nearly 2 million people in 1,566 state prisons, 98 federal prisons, 3,116 local jails, 1,277 juvenile correctional facilities, 133 immigration detention facilities, and 80 Indian country jails, as well as in military prisons, civil commitment centers, state psychiatric hospitals, and prisons in the U.S. territories.\"\nDespite disparate systems of confinement, four main institutions dominate: federal prisons, state prisons, local jails, and juvenile correctional facilities. Federal prisons are run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and hold pretrial detainees as well as people who have been convicted of federal crimes. State prisons, run by the department of corrections of each state, hold people sentenced and serving prison time (usually longer than one year) for felony offenses. Local jails are county or municipal facilities that incarcerate defendants prior to trial; they also hold those serving short sentences (typically under a year). Juvenile correctional facilities are operated by local or state governments and serve as longer-term placements for any minor adjudicated as delinquent and ordered by a judge to be confined.\nIn January 2023, the United States had the sixth-highest per capita incarceration rate in the world—531 people per 100,000 inhabitants—and the largest prison and jail population in the world, with more than 1.9 million people incarcerated. An analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed U.S. homicide rates \"were 7 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25 times higher\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe U.S. has a highly developed mixed economy that has been the world's largest nominally since about 1890. Its 2024 gross domestic product (GDP) of more than $29 trillion constituted over 25% of nominal global economic output, or 15% at purchasing power parity (PPP). From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7. The country ranks first in the world by nominal GDP, second when adjusted for purchasing power parities (PPP), and ninth by PPP-adjusted GDP per capita. In February 2024, the total U.S. federal government debt was $34.4 trillion.\n\nOf the world's 500 largest companies by revenue, 136 were headquartered in the U.S. in 2023, which is the highest number of any country. The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by the country's dominant economy, its military, the petrodollar system, its large U.S. treasuries market, and its linked eurodollar. Several countries use it as their official currency, and in others it is the de facto currency. The U.S. has free trade agreements with several countries, including the USMCA. Although the United States has reached a post-industrial level of economic development and is often described as having a service economy, it remains a major industrial power; in 2021, the U.S. manufacturing sector was the world's second-largest after China's.\n\nNew York City is the world's principal financial center, and its metropolitan area is the world's largest metropolitan economy. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, both located in New York City, are the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume. The United States is at the forefront of technological advancement and innovation in many economic fields, especially in artificial intelligence; electronics and computers; pharmaceuticals; and medical, aerospace and military equipment. The country's economy is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity. The largest trading partners of the United States are the European Union, Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, India, and Taiwan. The United States is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter. It is by far the world's largest exporter of services.\nAmericans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states, and the fourth-highest median household income in 2023, up from sixth-highest in 2013. With personal consumption expenditures of over $18.5 trillion in 2023, the U.S. has a heavily consumer-driven economy and is the world's largest consumer market. The U.S. ranked first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires in 2023, with 735 billionaires and nearly 22 million millionaires.\nWealth in the United States is highly concentrated; in 2011, the richest 10% of the adult population owned 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50% owned just 2%. U.S. wealth inequality increased substantially since the late 1980s, and income inequality in the U.S. reached a record high in 2019. In 2024, the country had some of the highest wealth and income inequality levels among OECD countries. Since the 1970s, there has been a decoupling of U.S. wage gains from worker productivity. In 2016, the top fifth of earners took home more than half of all income, giving the U.S. one of the widest income distributions among OECD countries. There were about 771,480 homeless persons in the U.S. in 2024. In 2022, 6.4 million children experienced food insecurity. Feeding America estimates that around one in five, or approximately 13 million, children experience hunger in the U.S. and do not know where or when they will get their next meal. Also in 2022, about 37.9 million people, or 11.5% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty.\nThe United States has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other high-income countries. It is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation nationally and one of a few countries in the world without federal paid family leave as a legal right. The United States has a higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed country, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nThe United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled the large-scale manufacturing of U.S. consumer products in the late 19th century. By the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.\n\nIn the 21st century, the United States continues to be one of the world's foremost scientific powers, though China has emerged as a major competitor in many fields. The U.S. has the highest research and development expenditures of any country and ranks ninth as a percentage of GDP. In 2022, the United States was (after China) the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers. In 2021, the U.S. ranked second (also after China) by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications (after China and Germany), according to World Intellectual Property Indicators. In 2023 and 2024, the United States ranked third (after Switzerland and Sweden) in the Global Innovation Index. The United States is considered to be the leading country in the development of artificial intelligence technology. In 2023, the United States was ranked the second most technologically advanced country in the world (after South Korea) by Global Finance magazine.\n\n\n==== Spaceflight ====\n\nThe United States has maintained a space program since the late 1950s, beginning with the establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958. NASA's Apollo program (1961–1972) achieved the first crewed Moon landing with the 1969 Apollo 11 mission; it remains one of the agency's most significant milestones. Other major endeavors by NASA include the Space Shuttle program (1981–2011), the Voyager program (1972–present), the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes (launched in 1990 and 2021, respectively), and the multi-mission Mars Exploration Program (Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance). NASA is one of five agencies collaborating on the International Space Station (ISS); U.S. contributions to the ISS include several modules, including Destiny (2001), Harmony (2007), and Tranquility (2010), as well as ongoing logistical and operational support.\nThe United States private sector dominates the global commercial spaceflight industry. Prominent American spaceflight contractors include Blue Origin, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and SpaceX. NASA programs such as the Commercial Crew Program, Commercial Resupply Services, Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and NextSTEP have facilitated growing private-sector involvement in American spaceflight.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nIn 2023, the United States received approximately 84% of its energy from fossil fuel, and its largest source of energy was petroleum (38%), followed by natural gas (36%), renewable sources (9%), coal (9%), and nuclear power (9%). In 2022, the United States constituted about 4% of the world's population, but consumed around 16% of the world's energy. The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China.\nThe U.S. is the world's largest producer of nuclear power, generating around 30% of the world's nuclear electricity. It also has the highest number of nuclear power reactors of any country. From 2024, the U.S. plans to triple its nuclear power capacity by 2050.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) road network, owned almost entirely by state and local governments, is the longest in the world. The extensive Interstate Highway System that connects all major cities is funded mostly by the federal government but maintained by state departments of transportation, supplemented by state expressways and some private toll roads.\nThe U.S. is among the top ten countries with the highest vehicle ownership per capita (850 vehicles per 1,000 people) in 2022. A 2022 study found that 76% of U.S. commuters drive alone and 14% ride a bicycle, including bike owners and users of bike-sharing networks. About 11% use some form of public transportation.\nPublic transportation in the United States is well developed in the largest urban areas, notably New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco; otherwise, coverage is generally less extensive than in most other developed countries. The U.S. also has many relatively car-dependent localities.\nLong-distance intercity travel is provided primarily by airlines, but travel by rail is more common along the Northeast Corridor, the only high-speed rail in the U.S. that meets international standards. Amtrak, the country's government-sponsored national passenger rail company, has a relatively sparse network compared to that of Western European countries. Service is concentrated in the Northeast, California, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, and Virginia/Southeast.\n\nThe United States has an extensive air transportation network. U.S. civilian airlines are all privately owned. The three largest airlines in the world, by total number of passengers carried, are U.S.-based; American Airlines became the global leader after its 2013 merger with US Airways. Of the 50 busiest airports in the world, 16 are in the United States, as well as five of the top 10. The world's busiest airport by passenger volume is Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2022, most of the 19,969 U.S. airports were owned and operated by local government authorities, and there are also some private airports. Some 5,193 are designated as \"public use\", including for general aviation. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has provided security at most major airports since 2001.\nThe country's rail transport network, the longest in the world at 182,412.3 mi (293,564.2 km), handles mostly freight (in contrast to more passenger-centered rail in Europe). Because they are often privately owned operations, U.S. railroads lag behind those of the rest of the world in terms of electrification.\nThe country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, totaling 41,009 km (25,482 mi). They are used extensively for freight, recreation, and a small amount of passenger traffic. Of the world's 50 busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, with the busiest in the U.S. being the Port of Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents on April 1, 2020, making the United States the third-most-populous country in the world, after China and India. The Census Bureau's official 2024 population estimate was 340,110,988, an increase of 2.6% since the 2020 census. According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on July 1, 2024, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 16 seconds, or about 5400 people per day. In 2023, 51% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 34% had never been married. In 2023, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.6 children per woman, and, at 23%, it had the world's highest rate of children living in single-parent households in 2019.\nThe United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members. White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population. Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the country's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total U.S. population. Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population. The country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%, and some 574 native tribes are recognized by the federal government. In 2024, the median age of the United States population was 39.1 years.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nWhile many languages are spoken in the United States, English is by far the most commonly spoken and written. In 2025, Executive Order 14224 declared English the official language of the U.S., and federal agencies recognize English as the official language under the order. However, the U.S. has never had a de jure official language, as Congress has never passed a law to designate English as official for all three federal branches. Some laws, such as U.S. naturalization requirements, nonetheless standardize English. Twenty-eight states and the United States Virgin Islands have laws that designate English as the sole official language; 19 states and the District of Columbia have no official language. Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English: Hawaii (Hawaiian), Alaska (twenty Native languages), South Dakota (Sioux), American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In total, 169 Native American languages are spoken in the United States. In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.\nAccording to the American Community Survey (2020), some 245.4 million people in the U.S. age five and older spoke only English at home. About 41.2 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (3.40 million), Tagalog (1.71 million), Vietnamese (1.52 million), Arabic (1.39 million), French (1.18 million), Korean (1.07 million), and Russian (1.04 million). German, spoken by 1 million people at home in 2010, fell to 857,000 total speakers in 2020.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\n\nAmerica's immigrant population is by far the world's largest in absolute terms. In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population. In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants. In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%). In fiscal year 2022, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence. In fiscal year 2024 alone, according to the Migration Policy Institute, the United States resettled 100,034 refugees, which \"re-cements the United States' role as the top global resettlement destination, far surpassing other major resettlement countries in Europe and Canada\".\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion in the country and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world, and profoundly vibrant.\n The country has the world's largest Christian population, which includes the fourth-largest population of Catholics. Other notable faiths include Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, New Age, and Native American religions. Religious practice varies significantly by region. \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.\nThe overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power or spiritual force, engage in spiritual practices such as prayer, and consider themselves religious or spiritual. In the Southern United States' \"Bible Belt\", evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally; New England and the Western United States tend to be more secular. Mormonism, a Restorationist movement founded in the U.S. in 1847, is the predominant religion in Utah and a major religion in Idaho.\n\n\n=== Urbanization ===\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs; about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. In 2022, 333 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities—New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston—had populations exceeding two million. Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), average American life expectancy at birth was 78.4 years in 2023 (75.8 years for men and 81.1 years for women). This was a gain of 0.9 year from 77.5 years in 2022, and the CDC noted that the new average was largely driven by \"decreases in mortality due to COVID-19, heart disease, unintentional injuries, cancer and diabetes\". Starting in 1998, life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.\nThe Commonwealth Fund reported in 2020 that the U.S. had the highest suicide rate among high-income countries. Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight. The U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other country, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer countries for reasons that are debated. The United States is the only developed country without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance. Government-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, then-President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Abortion in the United States is not federally protected, and is illegal or restricted in 17 states.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nAmerican primary and secondary education (known in the U.S. as K–12, \"kindergarten through 12th grade\") is decentralized. School systems are operated by state, territorial, and sometimes municipal governments and regulated by the U.S. Department of Education. In general, children are required to attend school or an approved homeschool from the age of five or six (kindergarten or first grade) until they are 18 years old. This often brings students through the 12th grade, the final year of a U.S. high school, but some states and territories allow them to leave school earlier, at age 16 or 17. The U.S. spends more on education per student than any other country, an average of $18,614 per year per public elementary and secondary school student in 2020–2021. Among Americans age 25 and older, 92.2% graduated from high school, 62.7% attended some college, 37.7% earned a bachelor's degree, and 14.2% earned a graduate degree. The U.S. literacy rate is near-universal. The U.S. has produced the most Nobel Prize winners of any country, with 411 (having won 413 awards).\nU.S. tertiary or higher education has earned a global reputation. Many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25. American higher education is dominated by state university systems, although the country's many private universities and colleges enroll about 20% of all American students. Local community colleges generally offer coursework and degree programs covering the first two years of college study. They often have more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and Americans spend more than all nations in combined public and private spending. Colleges and universities directly funded by the federal government do not charge tuition and are limited to military personnel and government employees, including: the U.S. service academies, the Naval Postgraduate School, and military staff colleges. Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place, student loan debt increased by 102% between 2010 and 2020, and exceeded $1.7 trillion in 2022.\n\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\nThe United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values. The country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy, as well as a strong work ethic and competitiveness. Voluntary altruism towards others also plays a major role; according to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity—the highest rate in the world by a large margin. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American Creed\" emphasizing consent of the governed, liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government. The U.S. has acquired significant hard and soft power through its diplomatic influence, economic power, military alliances, and cultural exports such as American movies, music, video games, sports, and food. The influence that the United States exerts on other countries through soft power is referred to as Americanization.\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Europe, Africa, or Asia (the \"Old World\") within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.\nThe American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high levels of social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.\nThe National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities is an agency of the United States federal government that was established in 1965 with the purpose to \"develop and promote a broadly conceived national policy of support for the humanities and the arts in the United States, and for institutions which preserve the cultural heritage of the United States.\" It is composed of four sub-agencies:\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts\nNational Endowment for the Humanities\nInstitute of Museum and Library Services\nFederal Council on the Arts and the Humanities\nUnder the First Amendment to the Constitution, the United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country. Flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese majesty are all forms of protected expression. A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured. Additionally, they are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship\". The U.S. is a socially progressive country with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality. LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced by global standards.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nColonial American authors were influenced by John Locke and other Enlightenment philosophers. The American Revolutionary Period (1765–1783) is notable for the political writings of Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson. Shortly before and after the Revolutionary War, the newspaper rose to prominence, filling a demand for anti-British national literature. An early novel is William Hill Brown's The Power of Sympathy, published in 1791. Writer and critic John Neal in the early- to mid-19th century helped advance America toward a unique literature and culture by criticizing predecessors such as Washington Irving for imitating their British counterparts, and by influencing writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, who took American poetry and short fiction in new directions. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller pioneered the influential Transcendentalism movement; Henry David Thoreau, author of Walden, was influenced by this movement.\nThe conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired writers, like Harriet Beecher Stowe, and authors of slave narratives, such as Frederick Douglass. Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (1850) explored the dark side of American history, as did Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851). Major American poets of the 19th century American Renaissance include Walt Whitman, Melville, and Emily Dickinson. Mark Twain was the first major American writer to be born in the West. Henry James achieved international recognition with novels like The Portrait of a Lady (1881). As literacy rates rose, periodicals published more stories centered around industrial workers, women, and the rural poor. Naturalism, regionalism, and realism were the major literary movements of the period.\nWhile modernism generally took on an international character, modernist authors working within the United States more often rooted their work in specific regions, peoples, and cultures. Following the Great Migration to northern cities, African-American and black West Indian authors of the Harlem Renaissance developed an independent tradition of literature that rebuked a history of inequality and celebrated black culture. An important cultural export during the Jazz Age, these writings were a key influence on Négritude, a philosophy emerging in the 1930s among francophone writers of the African diaspora. In the 1950s, an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the Great American Novel, while the Beat Generation rejected this conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the spoken word over mechanics to describe drug use, sexuality, and the failings of society. Contemporary literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious experiments with language. Twelve American laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\n=== Mass media ===\n\nMedia in the United States is broadly uncensored, with the First Amendment providing significant protections, as reiterated in New York Times Co. v. United States. The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. The U.S. cable television system offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches. In 2021, about 83% of Americans over age 12 listened to broadcast radio, while about 40% listened to podcasts. In the prior year, there were 15,460 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.\nU.S. newspapers with a global reach and reputation include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and USA Today. About 800 publications are produced in Spanish. With few exceptions, newspapers are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in an increasingly rare situation, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as The Village Voice in New York City and LA Weekly in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Facebook, Amazon, and Reddit—all of them American-owned.\nIn 2022, the video game market of the United States was the world's largest by revenue. In 2015, the U.S. video game industry consisted of 2,457 companies that employed around 220,000 jobs and generated $30.4 billion in revenue. There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone. According to the Game Developers Conference (GDC), the U.S. is the top location for video game development, with 58% of game developers based in the country in 2025.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\n\nThe United States is well known for its theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater. By the middle of the 19th century, America had created new distinct dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show. The central hub of the American theater scene is the Theater District in Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.\nMany movie and television celebrities have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theater and are presented at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theater. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n\nFolk art in colonial America grew out of artisanal craftsmanship in communities that allowed commonly trained people to individually express themselves. It was distinct from Europe's tradition of high art, which was less accessible and generally less relevant to early American settlers. Cultural movements in art and craftsmanship in colonial America generally lagged behind those of Western Europe. For example, the prevailing medieval style of woodworking and primitive sculpture became integral to early American folk art, despite the emergence of Renaissance styles in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The new English styles would have been early enough to make a considerable impact on American folk art, but American styles and forms had already been firmly adopted. Not only did styles change slowly in early America, but there was a tendency for rural artisans there to continue their traditional forms longer than their urban counterparts did—and far longer than those in Western Europe.\nThe Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the visual arts tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.\nAmerican Realism and American Regionalism sought to reflect and give America new ways of looking at itself. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new and individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.\nThe tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan is the largest art museum in the United States and the fourth-largest in the world.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, mainland Europe, or Africa. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music in particular have influenced American music. Banjos were brought to America through the slave trade. Minstrel shows incorporating the instrument into their acts led to its increased popularity and widespread production in the 19th century. The electric guitar, first invented in the 1930s, and mass-produced by the 1940s, had an enormous influence on popular music, in particular due to the development of rock and roll. The synthesizer, turntablism, and electronic music were also largely developed in the U.S.\nElements from folk idioms such as the blues and old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz grew from blues and ragtime in the early 20th century, developing from the innovations and recordings of composers such as W.C. Handy and Jelly Roll Morton. Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington increased its popularity early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, bluegrass and rhythm and blues in the 1940s, and rock and roll in the 1950s. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters. The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States in the 1970s.\nThe United States has the world's largest music market, with a total retail value of $15.9 billion in 2022. Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Mid-20th-century American pop stars, such as Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, became global celebrities and best-selling music artists, as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey, and of the early 21st century, such as Eminem, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nThe United States has the world's largest apparel market by revenue. Apart from professional business attire, American fashion is eclectic and predominantly informal. Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing; however, sneakers, jeans, T-shirts, and baseball caps are emblematic of American styles. New York, with its Fashion Week, is considered to be one of the \"Big Four\" global fashion capitals, along with Paris, Milan, and London. A study demonstrated that general proximity to Manhattan's Garment District has been synonymous with American fashion since its inception in the early 20th century.\nA number of well-known designer labels, among them Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford and Calvin Klein, are headquartered in Manhattan. Labels cater to niche markets, such as preteens. New York Fashion Week is one of the most influential fashion shows in the world, and is held twice each year in Manhattan; the annual Met Gala, also in Manhattan, has been called the fashion world's \"biggest night\".\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is also metonymous for the American filmmaking industry. The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful movies selling the most tickets in the world.\nLargely centered in the New York City region from its beginnings in the late 19th century through the first decades of the 20th century, the U.S. film industry has since been primarily based in and around Hollywood. Nonetheless, American film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization in the 21st century, and an increasing number of films are made elsewhere. The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929, and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.\nThe industry peaked in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s, with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures. In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\", or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\", was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period. The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, which came to rival traditional cinema.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to foods such as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as wheat flour, beef, and milk, to create a distinctive American cuisine. New World crops, especially pumpkin, corn, potatoes, and turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on Thanksgiving, when many Americans prepare or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, hamburgers, hot dogs, and American pizza derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups. Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and adaptations of Chinese cuisine as well as pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.\nAmerican chefs have had a significant impact on society both domestically and internationally. In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and Frances Roth. This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful careers. The United States restaurant industry was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020, and employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the nation's workforce directly. It is the country's second-largest private employer and the third-largest employer overall. The United States is home to over 220 Michelin star-rated restaurants, 70 of which are in New York City alone.\nWine has been produced in what is now the United States since the 1500s, with the first widespread production beginning in what is now New Mexico in 1628. In the modern U.S., wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with California producing 84 percent of all U.S. wine. With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500 km2) under vine, the United States is the fourth-largest wine-producing country in the world, after Italy, Spain, and France.\nThe classic American diner, a casual restaurant type originally intended for the working class, emerged during the 19th century from converted railroad dining cars made stationary. The diner soon evolved into purpose-built structures whose number expanded greatly in the 20th century. The American fast-food industry developed alongside the nation's car culture. American restaurants developed the drive-in format in the 1920s, which they began to replace with the drive-through format by the 1940s. American fast-food restaurant chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin' Donuts and many others, have numerous outlets around the world.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact. The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States; the National Football League has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally. However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S. \"national sport\" since the late 19th century. After American football, the next four most popular professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. Their premier leagues are, respectively, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, and the National Hockey League. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually, and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA March Madness tournament and the College Football Playoff are some of the most watched national sporting events. In the U.S., the intercollegiate sports level serves as the main feeder system for professional and Olympic sports, with significant exceptions such as Minor League Baseball. This differs greatly from practices in nearly all other countries, where publicly and privately funded sports organizations serve this function.\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe. The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,968 medals (1,179 gold) at the Olympic Games, the most of any country.\nIn other international competition, the United States is the home of a number of prestigious events, including the Americas Cup, World Baseball Classic, the U.S. Open, and the Masters Tournament. The U.S. men's national soccer team has qualified for eleven World Cups, while the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each. The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup was also hosted by the United States. Its final match was attended by 90,185, setting the world record for largest women's sporting event crowd at the time.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLists of U.S. state topics\nOutline of the United States\nList of online encyclopedias of U.S. states, typically maintained by state historical societies, universities, or humanities councils\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nKey Development Forecasts for the United States from International Futures\n\n\n=== Government ===\nOfficial U.S. Government web portal – gateway to government sites\nHouse – official website of the United States House of Representatives\nSenate – official website of the United States Senate\nWhite House – official website of the president of the United States\nSupreme Court – official website of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n=== History ===\n\"Historical Documents\" – website from the National Center for Public Policy Research\n\"Historical Statistics\" – links to U.S. historical data\n\n\n=== Maps ===\n\"National Atlas of the United States\" – official maps from the U.S. Department of the Interior\n Wikimedia Atlas of the United States\n Geographic data related to United States at OpenStreetMap\n\"Measure of America\" – a variety of mapped information relating to health, education, income, safety and demographics in the United States",

        "title": "Bruce Willis",
        "content": "Walter Bruce Willis (born March 19, 1955) is a retired American actor. He achieved fame with a leading role on the comedy-drama series Moonlighting (1985–1989) and has appeared in over one hundred films, gaining recognition as an action hero for his portrayal of John McClane in the Die Hard franchise (1988–2013).\nWillis's other credits include The Last Boy Scout (1991), Pulp Fiction (1994), 12 Monkeys (1995), The Fifth Element (1997), Armageddon (1998), The Sixth Sense (1999), Unbreakable, The Whole Nine Yards (both 2000), Tears of the Sun (2003), Sin City (2005), The Expendables, Red (both 2010), Looper (2012), and Glass (2019). In the last years of his career, he starred in many low-budget direct-to-video films, which were poorly received. Willis retired in 2022 due to aphasia, and was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023.\nAs a singer, Willis released his debut album, The Return of Bruno, in 1987, followed by two more albums in 1989 and 2001. He made his Broadway debut in the stage adaptation of Misery in 2015. Willis has received various accolades throughout his career, including a Golden Globe Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and two People's Choice Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006. Films featuring Willis have grossed between US$2.64 billion and US$3.05 billion at North American box offices, making him in 2010 the eighth-highest-grossing leading actor.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWalter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany; his mother, Marlene, was from Kassel, Germany, and his father, David Willis (1929–2009), was an American soldier. He has a younger sister, Florence, and two younger brothers, Robert (1959–2001) and David. After being discharged from the military in 1957, his father relocated the family to his hometown of Carneys Point, New Jersey. Willis has described his background as a \"long line of blue-collar people\". His mother worked in a bank and his father was a welder, master mechanic and factory worker.\nWillis spoke with a stutter. He attended Penns Grove High School in Carneys Point Township, where his schoolmates nicknamed him \"Buck-Buck\". Willis joined the drama club, and found that acting on stage reduced his stutter. He was eventually elected student council president. He graduated from Penns Grove in 1973.\nAfter graduating from high school, Willis worked as a security guard at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant and transported crew members at the DuPont Chambers Works factory in Deepwater. He turned to acting after working as a private investigator, a role he would later play in the comedy-drama series Moonlighting and the action-comedy film The Last Boy Scout.\nWillis enrolled in the drama program at Montclair State University, where he was cast in a production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. He left the school in 1977, and moved to New York City, where he supported himself in the early 1980s as a bartender at various nightspots in Manhattan including Kamikaze, Cafe Central & Chelsea Central, while living in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1980s: Moonlighting, Die Hard and rise to fame ===\n\nWillis was cast as David Addison Jr. in the television series Moonlighting (1985–1989), competing against 3,000 other actors for the position. His starring role in Moonlighting, opposite Cybill Shepherd, helped to establish him as a comedic actor. During the show's five seasons, he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy. During the height of the show's success, beverage maker Seagram hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden Wine Cooler products. The advertising campaign paid Willis US$5–7 million over two years. Willis chose not to renew his contract when he decided to stop drinking alcohol in 1988.\nIn 1987, Willis obtained his first lead role in the Blake Edwards film Blind Date, co-starring with Kim Basinger and John Larroquette. Edwards cast him again to play the real-life cowboy actor Tom Mix in Sunset (1988). The same year, he starred in an action role in Die Hard (1988) as John McClane. He performed most of his own stunts in the film, and the film grossed $138,708,852 worldwide. Following his success with Die Hard, Willis had a leading role in the drama In Country as Vietnam veteran Emmett Smith and also provided the voice for a talking baby in Look Who's Talking (1989) and the sequel Look Who's Talking Too (1990).\nIn the late 1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a recording artist, recording an album of pop-blues, The Return of Bruno, which included the hit single \"Respect Yourself\" featuring the Pointer Sisters. The LP was promoted by a Spinal Tap–like rockumentary parody featuring scenes of Willis performing at famous events including Woodstock. He released a version of the Drifters song \"Under the Boardwalk\" as a second single; it reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, but was less successful in the US. Willis returned to the recording studio several times.\n\n\n=== 1990s: Die Hard sequels, Pulp Fiction and dramatic roles ===\nHaving acquired major personal success and pop culture influence playing John McClane in Die Hard, Willis reprised his role in the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995). These first three installments in the Die Hard series grossed over US$700 million internationally and propelled Willis to the first rank of Hollywood action stars. At one point, Die Hard 2 and Ghost, starring Willis's then wife Demi Moore, would occupy the number one and number two spots at the box office, a feat that would not be accomplished again for a married Hollywood couple until 2024.\nIn the early 1990s, Willis's career suffered a moderate slump, as he starred in flops such as The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) and Hudson Hawk (1991), although he did find box office success with The Last Boy Scout (1991). He gained more success with Striking Distance (1993) but flopped again with Color of Night (1994): it was savaged by critics but did well in the home video market and became one of the Top 20 most-rented films in the United States in 1995. Maxim also ranked his sex scene in the film as the best in film history.\nIn 1994, Willis also had a leading role in one part of Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed Pulp Fiction; the film's success gave a boost to his career, and he starred alongside his Look Who's Talking co-star John Travolta. In 1996, he was the executive producer and star of the cartoon Bruno the Kid which featured a CGI representation of himself. That same year, he starred in Mike Judge's animated film Beavis and Butt-head Do America with his then-wife Demi Moore. In the movie, he plays a drunken criminal named \"Muddy Grimes\", who mistakenly sends Judge's titular characters to kill his wife, Dallas (voiced by Moore). He then played the lead roles in 12 Monkeys (1995) and The Fifth Element (1997). However, by the end of the 1990s his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like The Jackal (which despite negative reviews was a box office hit), Mercury Rising, and Breakfast of Champions, as well as the implosion of the production of Broadway Brawler, a debacle salvaged only by the success of the Michael Bay-directed Armageddon, which Willis had agreed to star in as compensation for the failed production, and which turned out to be the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide. The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the PlayStation video game Apocalypse. In 1999, Willis played the starring role in M. Night Shyamalan's film The Sixth Sense, which was both a commercial and critical success.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\nIn 2000, Willis won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on Friends (in which he played the father of Ross Geller's much-younger girlfriend). He was also nominated for a 2001 American Comedy Award (in the Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series category) for his work on Friends. Also in 2000, Willis played Jimmy \"The Tulip\" Tudeski in The Whole Nine Yards alongside Matthew Perry, and Russ Duritz in Disney's The Kid opposite Emily Mortimer. Willis was originally cast as Terry Benedict in Ocean's Eleven (2001) but dropped out to work on recording an album. In the sequel, Ocean's Twelve (2004), he makes a cameo appearance as himself. In 2005, he appeared in the film adaptation of Sin City. In 2006, he lent his voice as RJ the Raccoon in Over the Hedge. In 2007, he appeared in the Planet Terror half of the double feature Grindhouse as the villain, a mutant soldier. This marked Willis's second collaboration with the director Robert Rodriguez, following Sin City.\nWillis appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show on February 26, 2003, when he was supposed to be a guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis staged elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, having one side of his face made up with simulated birdshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (a parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.\nOn April 12, 2007, he appeared again, this time wearing a Sanjaya Malakar wig. On his June 25, 2007, appearance, he wore a mini-wind turbine on his head to accompany a joke about his own fictional documentary titled An Unappealing Hunch (a wordplay on An Inconvenient Truth). Willis also appeared in Japanese Subaru Legacy television commercials. Tying in with this, Subaru did a limited run of Legacys, badged \"Subaru Legacy Touring Bruce\", in honor of Willis.\nWillis has appeared in five films with Samuel L. Jackson (1993's National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, 1994's Pulp Fiction, 1995's Die Hard with a Vengeance, 2000's Unbreakable, and 2019's Glass) and both actors were slated to work together in Black Water Transit, before dropping out. Willis also worked with his eldest daughter, Rumer, in the 2005 film Hostage. In 2006, he appeared in the crime/drama film Alpha Dog, opposite Sharon Stone. In 2007, he appeared in the thriller Perfect Stranger, opposite Halle Berry, and reprised his role as John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard. Subsequently, he appeared in the films What Just Happened (2008) and Surrogates (2009), based on the comic book of the same name.\nWillis was slated to play U.S. Army general William R. Peers in director Oliver Stone's Pinkville, a drama about the investigation of the 1968 My Lai massacre. However, due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, the film was canceled. Willis appeared on the 2008 Blues Traveler album North Hollywood Shootout, giving a spoken word performance over an instrumental blues rock jam on the track \"Free Willis (Ruminations from Behind Uncle Bob's Machine Shop)\". In early 2009, he appeared in an advertising campaign to publicize the insurance company Norwich Union's change of name to Aviva.\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\n\nAs of 2010, Willis was the eighth highest-grossing actor in a leading role and 12th-highest including supporting roles. Willis starred with Tracy Morgan in the 2010 comedy Cop Out, directed by Kevin Smith, about two police detectives investigating the theft of a baseball card. Willis appeared in the music video for the song \"Stylo\" by Gorillaz. Also in 2010, he appeared in a cameo with the former Planet Hollywood co-owners and 80s action stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film The Expendables. Willis played the role of CIA agent \"Mr. Church\". It was the first time the three action stars had appeared on screen together. Although the scene featuring the three was short, it was one of the most highly anticipated scenes in the film. The trio filmed their scene in an empty church on October 24, 2009. Willis next starred in Red, an adaptation of the comic book mini-series of the same name, in which he portrayed Frank Moses. The film was released on October 15, 2010.\nWillis starred alongside Bill Murray, Edward Norton, and Frances McDormand in Moonrise Kingdom (2012). Filming took place in Rhode Island under the direction of Wes Anderson, in 2011. Willis returned, in an expanded role, in The Expendables 2 (2012). He appeared alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the sci-fi action film Looper (2012), as the older version of Gordon-Levitt's character, Joe.\nWillis teamed up with 50 Cent in a film directed by David Barrett called Fire with Fire, starring opposite Josh Duhamel and Rosario Dawson, about a fireman who must save the love of his life. Willis also joined Vince Vaughn and Catherine Zeta-Jones in Lay the Favorite, directed by Stephen Frears, about a Las Vegas cocktail waitress who becomes an elite professional gambler. The two films were distributed by Lionsgate Entertainment.\nWillis reprised his most famous role, John McClane, for a fifth time, starring in A Good Day to Die Hard, which was released on February 14, 2013. In an interview, Willis said, \"I have a warm spot in my heart for Die Hard..... it's just the sheer novelty of being able to play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun. It's much more challenging to have to do a film again and try to compete with myself, which is what I do in Die Hard. I try to improve my work every time.\"\nOn October 12, 2013, Willis hosted Saturday Night Live with Katy Perry as a musical guest. In 2015, Willis made his Broadway debut in William Goldman's adaptation of Stephen King's novel Misery opposite Laurie Metcalf at the Broadhurst Theatre. His performance was generally panned by critics, who called it \"vacant\" and \"inert\". Willis was the subject of a roast by Comedy Central in a program broadcast on July 29, 2018. Willis played himself in a cameo in the 2019 film The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.\n\n\n=== 2020s: Critical decline, health problems and retirement ===\nIn the final years of his career, Willis starred in many low-budget independent thrillers and science fiction films. He worked primarily with the production companies Emmett/Furla Oasis (which produced 20 films starring Willis) and 308 Entertainment Inc. Most of the films were released direct-to-video and were widely panned. The Golden Raspberry Awards, an annual award for the year's worst films and performances, created a dedicated category, the Worst Bruce Willis Performance in a 2021 Movie, for Willis's roles in eight films released that year. Chris Nashawaty of Esquire described the direct-to-video films as \"a profitable safe harbor\" for older actors, similar to The Expendables. Willis would often earn US$2 million for two days' work, with an average of 15 minutes' screentime per film. He nonetheless featured heavily in the films' promotional materials, earning them the derogatory nickname \"geezer teasers\". \nThose working on the films later said Willis appeared confused, did not understand why he was there and had to be fed lines through an earpiece. Days before Willis was scheduled to arrive on set for Out of Death (2021), the screenwriter, Bill Lawrence, was instructed to reduce his role and abbreviate his dialogue. The director, Mike Burns, was told to complete all of Willis's scenes in a single day of filming. \nOn March 30, 2022, Willis's family announced that he was retiring because he had been diagnosed with aphasia, a disorder typically caused by damage to the area of the brain that controls language expression and comprehension. The Golden Raspberry Awards retracted its Willis category, deeming it inappropriate to give a Razzie to someone whose performance was affected by a medical condition. At the time of his retirement, Willis had completed 11 films awaiting release.\n\n\n== Business activities ==\nWillis owns houses in Los Angeles and Penns Grove, New Jersey. He also rents apartments at Trump Tower and in Riverside South, Manhattan. In 2000, Willis and his business partner Arnold Rifkin started a motion picture production company called Cheyenne Enterprises. He left the company to be run solely by Rifkin in 2007 after Live Free or Die Hard. He also owns several small businesses in Hailey, Idaho, including The Mint Bar and The Liberty Theater and was one of the first promoters of Planet Hollywood, with actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Willis and the other actors were paid for their appearances and endorsements through an employee stock ownership plan.\nIn 2009, Willis signed a contract to become the international face of Belvedere SA's Sobieski Vodka in exchange for 3.3% ownership in the company. In 2018, Willis became the brand ambassador of the Hungarian brand Hell Energy Drink.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nWillis's acting role models are Gary Cooper, Robert De Niro, Steve McQueen, and John Wayne. He is left-handed. He resides in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles with his family.\nOn November 21, 1987, Willis married Demi Moore at the Golden Nugget Las Vegas. On December 20, the couple held a second reception for about 450 guests on a soundstage at Warner Bros. Studios Burbank. They have three daughters: Rumer (b. 1988), Scout (b. 1991), and Tallulah (b. 1994). Willis and Moore announced their separation on June 24, 1998. They filed for divorce on October 18, 2000, and the divorce was finalized later that day. Regarding the divorce, Willis stated, \"I felt I had failed as a father and a husband by not being able to make it work.\" He credited actor Will Smith for helping him cope with the situation. He has maintained a close friendship with both Moore and her subsequent husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, and attended their wedding.\nWillis was engaged to actress Brooke Burns until they broke up in 2004 after ten months together. He married model Emma Heming in Turks and Caicos on March 21, 2009; guests included his three daughters, as well as Moore and Kutcher. The ceremony was not legally binding, so the couple wed again in a civil ceremony in Beverly Hills six days later. The couple has two daughters, one born in 2012 and another born in 2014.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nOn February 16, 2023, Willis's family announced that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. According to Gregg Day, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic's Florida campus, the symptoms include difficulties with language and comprehension, and misinterpretation of instructions. In a statement, the family said that Willis's condition had progressed and that \"challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease\". They expressed hope that media attention on Willis would raise awareness about the disease. Emma Willis's memoir The Unexpected Journey, which focuses on her experience as her husband's caregiver, will be published in September 2025.\nAs his condition progressed, Willis's family made the decision to have him live in a separate, one-story home designed to accommodate his needs and provide a calm environment. This arrangement was intended to prioritize the well-being of their two daughters, Mabel Ray and Evelyn Penn, ensuring they have a stable home life while still maintaining close contact with their father. Willis resides in this home with a full-time care team, and his family visits him regularly, often for meals and quality time. Despite the separation, the family emphasizes that the home remains filled with love, care, and laughter, reflecting their commitment to supporting Willis through his health challenges.\n\n\n=== Military interests ===\n\nThroughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as In Country, The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Willis grew up in a military family. Willis has donated Girl Scout cookies to the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis's then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time.\nIn 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq War, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered US$1 million to any noncombatant who turned in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press was more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war:\n\nI went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, \"X number of people were killed today,\" which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country. \n\n\n=== Religious beliefs ===\nWillis was a Lutheran, but says he no longer practices. In a July 1998 interview with George magazine, he said, \"Organized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms. They were all very important when we didn't know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened. Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! I choose not to believe that's the way. And that's what makes America cool, you know?\"\nWhen asked by a Hollywood.tv reporter how he stays grounded in Hollywood, Willis said, \"I just thank God every day for...everything great that's come my way.\"\n\n\n=== Political views ===\nIn 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore campaigned for then Democratic Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis's presidential campaign in the 1988 presidential elections. In the 1992 presidential election, however, he supported President George H. W. Bush for reelection and was an outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. In 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole because Dole criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year.\nIn 2006, Willis said that the United States should intervene more extensively in Colombia to end drug trafficking from that nation. In several interviews Willis has said that he supports increased salaries for teachers and police officers, and that he is disappointed in the United States foster care system and its treatment of Native Americans. Willis has supported gun rights, saying, \"Everyone has a right to bear arms. If you take guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who have guns are the bad guys.\"\nIn February 2006, when Willis was in Manhattan to promote his film 16 Blocks, he was asked his opinion on the Bush administration. Willis responded: \"I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican.\" Willis did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he said that he maintains some beliefs aligned with Republican ideas.\nOn August 17, 2006, Willis was named in a Los Angeles Times advertisement that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. In the 2012 presidential election, Willis said that he had a negative opinion of Mitt Romney.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations/guest appearances ===\n1986: Moonlighting soundtrack; track \"Good Lovin'\"\n1991: Hudson Hawk soundtrack; tracks \"Swinging on a Star\" and \"Side by Side\", both duets with Danny Aiello\n2000: The Whole Nine Yards soundtrack; tracks \"Tenth Avenue Tango\"\n2001: Classic Bruce Willis: The Universal Masters Collection (Polygram Int'l, OCLC 71124889)\n2003: Rugrats Go Wild soundtrack; \"Big Bad Cat\" with Chrissie Hynde and \"Lust for Life\"\n2008: North Hollywood Shootout, Blues Traveler; track \"Free Willis (Ruminations from Behind Uncle Bob's Machine Shop)\"\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Acting credits and accolades ==\n\nWillis has won a variety of awards and has received various honors throughout his career in television and film.\n\n1987: Golden Apple Awards honored with the Sour Apple.\n1994: Maxim magazine ranked his sex scene in Color of Night the No. 1 sex scene in film history\n2000: American Cinematheque Gala Tribute honored Willis with the American Cinematheque Award for an extraordinary artist in the entertainment industry who is fully engaged in his or her work and is committed to making a significant contribution to the art of the motion pictures.\n2002: The Hasty Pudding Man of the Year award from Harvard's Hasty Pudding Theatricals – given to performers who give a lasting and impressive contribution to the world of entertainment\n2002: Appointed as national spokesman for Children in Foster Care by President George W.

        "title": "Happy Gilmore 2",
        "content": "Happy Gilmore 2 is a 2025 American sports comedy film serving as a sequel to Happy Gilmore (1996), and starring Adam Sandler. It was written and produced by Sandler and Tim Herlihy, and directed by Kyle Newacheck. Sandler, Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, and Ben Stiller reprise their roles from the original film, while Benny Safdie and Bad Bunny star in new roles.\nThe film follows Happy Gilmore (played by Sandler), a widowed alcoholic and ex-golfer who returns to professional golf to help pay for his daughter's overseas ballet school. \nFilming took place in New Jersey from September to December 2024. Happy Gilmore 2 was released onto Netflix on July 25, 2025, like the previous film, it received mixed reviews.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter winning his first Tour Championship in 1996, Happy Gilmore has a successful golf career, winning five more championships. He also has five children with his wife Virginia Venit, the professional golf tour's public relations director. \nAfter accidentally killing Virginia in 2014 when one of his drives hits her in the head, Happy feels devastated and quits golf out of guilt. He soon becomes an alcoholic and loses everything after a repossession worker sues him for instigating a brawl when mistaking the worker for a car thief.\nEleven years later, Happy works at a supermarket and lives with his only daughter and youngest child Vienna. His four sons (Gordie, Wayne, Bobby, and Terry) have moved out and are working to support their father and sister. Vienna wants to pursue dancing, and her dance teacher recommends enrolling in a four-year ballet school in Paris, which costs $75,000 annually. \nFrank Manatee, CEO of Maxi Energy Drink and the golf league Maxi Golf, approaches Happy and wants him to be the league's star. Happy refuses but resumes playing golf with encouragement from John Daly, wanting to win enough money to put Vienna through ballet school.\nPlaying his first round since Virginia died, Happy drinks heavily and crashes his golf cart, which gets him fired from his job and into legal trouble. A jury agrees to remove all charges if he completes an alcohol treatment program and refrains from any physical altercations. The program's leader turns out to be Hal L., the caretaker who forced Happy's grandmother into sweat shop labor.\nVienna and John advise Happy to practice seriously and to join the next Tour Championship, which he does. A month later, Happy meets old companions, including Doug Thompson, president of the Tour, who worries about Maxi Golf rising fast. After Happy suggests a competition between the two leagues, Doug proposes a match with the five best players from each league competing against one another. \nHappy, with help from his new caddie, Oscar Mejías, plays well at the Tour Championship in the first three rounds, but collapses in the fourth on Mother's Day, seeing visions of Virginia on the course before getting drunk; he finishes sixth. The winner, Billy Jenkins, admits to being in Maxi Golf despite taking part in the Tour Championship. Happy replaces him on the team.\nHaving been in psychiatric care since losing to Happy at the 1996 Tour Championship, Shooter McGavin is granted a release by Frank. He explains to Shooter that all players on Maxi Golf, Billy included, have their iliolumbar ligament severed, increasing their driving distance, and asks him to join as their captain. \nDisgusted at this and how Frank's \"extreme\" version of golf strays from the traditional game, Shooter escapes. Having heard about Virginia's death, he then visits her grave and briefly fights Happy there before they call a truce. Happy then encounters Slim Peterson, whose father Chubbs had mentored Happy in 1996, and Slim joins Shooter in coaching Happy, Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, and Scottie Scheffler to face Maxi Golf.\nDuring the match, Scottie is disqualified in the first round for punching his opponent. Although the course is heavily designed to advantage Maxi Golf, as all their golfers are long drivers, the traditional golfers manage to make it 2–2, with the help of Shooter, who replaces Brooks after he gets injured. \nHappy and Billy then face off in a tie-breaker. Happy has a chance to putt for victory, but Frank alters the green to make it impossible to putt. He then makes a deal with Happy: if Happy misses the putt, he must join Maxi Golf. Otherwise, Frank must discontinue Maxi Golf, buy Happy's house back, pay for Vienna's ballet school, give Happy his new electric car, and open an Italian restaurant for Oscar. With help from the latter, Happy sinks the putt and wins.\nWhen Happy celebrates his three-month sobriety, Hal is exposed as a con artist and arrested. Maxi Energy Drink is discontinued after being revealed to cause significant oral health issues, leaving Frank in ruin and in hiding. Happy later accompanies his kids at an airport as they fly off to Paris, promising to join them after completing the British Open, but is forced to walk when he forgets to charge the electric car.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nAdam Sandler as Happy Gilmore, a famous golfer with a talent for abnormal longshots who comes out of retirement\nJulie Bowen as Virginia Gilmore (née Venit), Happy's deceased wife, whom he accidentally killed 10 years prior\nChristopher McDonald as Shooter McGavin, Happy's rival who suffered a mental breakdown following his defeat at the Tour Championship at the end of the first film, and teams up with Happy to stop Maxi Golf\nBenny Safdie as Frank Manatee, the CEO of Maxi Energy Drink and sponsor of Maxi Golf\nBenito Antonio Martínez Ocasio as Oscar Mejías, Happy's caddy and a former busboy who dreams of owning a restaurant\nJohn Daly as a fictionalized version of himself, a hermit who lives in Happy's garage\nBen Stiller as Hal L., the abusive leader of a support group for alcoholics.

The scene serves as a memorial to some beloved characters and actors from the original film who died between the films.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn September 2022, Adam Sandler stated that he hoped to eventually make a sequel to Happy Gilmore, saying he had been creating ideas for what a follow-up film would be, while stating the character would be involved in a senior golf tour. In February 2024, Carl Weathers, who played Chubbs Peterson in the first film, died at age 76. Despite his character's death in the first film, he was set to reprise his role appearing as a ghost in Happy's dreams while his son Slim (Lavell Crawford) would resent Happy for causing his father's death. Weathers' death forced a heavy rewrite with Chubbs instead being given tributes throughout the film and Slim having already forgiven Happy and reduced to a smaller supporting role. Other actors, who had died since the first film that are given tributes, include Frances Bay who played Grandma Anna Gilmore, Richard Kiel who played Mr. Larson, gameshow host Bob Barker who played himself and Joe Flaherty who played Donald the \"Jackass\" Guy, each of whom died in 2011, 2014, 2023 and 2024, respectively. An indirect tribute was given to Dustin Diamond (who died in 2021), due to the Maxi Golf character Screech being confused for Diamond's character of the same name from Saved by the Bell, despite Diamond and Sandler having never worked together.\nIn March 2024, Christopher McDonald revealed that a sequel was in development, and that Sandler had shown him a draft of the script to read. During development, the LIV Golf league was founded by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund to rival the PGA Tour, giving inspirations to the film's storyline of the rivalry between the Tour and Maxi Golf.\nIn May 2024, it was announced that Netflix greenlit the film, taking over for the first film's distributor Universal Pictures. Kyle Newacheck was hired to direct the film, with Tim Herlihy co-writing the screenplay with Sandler. In July, Nick Swardson announced he would star in the film. In August, Sandler revealed Benny Safdie would have a role in the film, with football player Travis Kelce set to make a cameo. In September, McDonald and Julie Bowen were confirmed to be reprising their roles, with Bad Bunny, Margaret Qualley, and Maxwell Jacob Friedman added to the cast. John Daly revealed his own involvement with the film.\nPrincipal photography began on September 9, 2024, in New Jersey, coinciding with Sandler's 58th birthday. A casting call took place at a hotel in Morristown, New Jersey. Filming locations in New Jersey include a country club in Bedminster, a burger shop in Garfield, a golf center in Hackettstown, a nail salon in Maplewood, a beach in Middletown, a deli in Millburn, a French restaurant in Montclair, a cafe in Morristown, a public school in Newark, Seton Hall University in South Orange, Montclair Golf Club in West Orange, Verona Town Hall in Verona Township, a boys & girls club in Kearny, and a Stop & Shop supermarket in Clifton.  Filming wrapped on December 10, 2024.\n\n\n== Release ==\nHappy Gilmore 2 premiered at the Lincoln Center in New York City on July 21, 2025. The film was released on Netflix on July 25, 2025. For the week of July 21–27, Happy Gilmore 2 ranked first on Netflix's list of English-language movies, drawing 46.7 million views in three days making it the biggest US Netflix film debut of the year, with 4.7 million views in the US over its initial weekend.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 63% of 121 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"With Adam Sandler and company clearly having a good time, Happy Gilmore 2 thwacks hard with nostalgia when it should've putted but will still put fans of the original back in their happy place.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 52 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.\nRichard Roeper of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"The scatological 'humor' is as low-brow as it gets; either you find it funny or you don't. I've never been a huge fan of that ... stuff, but the physical, Three Stooges material has a certain, admittedly dumb, slapstick appeal. Still, Happy Gilmore makes par through the strength of its sheer stupid energy and the game efforts of Sandler and his 50 or so co-stars. It's good to be back in that Happy Place.\"\nConversely, Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Other than a running gag revolving around Happy's use of every possible object as a liquor container, the film's main humor involves people being painfully hit by golf balls. By the time the movie ends and you've been assaulted by one tired gag after another, you'll know exactly how they feel.\"\nLiz Shannon Miller of Consequence gave the film a B- and commented \"Between Happy's family life and a whole new series of challenges for him to tackle, there's enough freshness to the plot to keep it from feeling like a total rehash of what came before, while still delivering wild golf stunts and a huge range of cameos.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHappy Gilmore 2 on Netflix \nHappy Gilmore 2 at IMDb",

        "title": "Labubu",
        "content": "Labubu ( lah-BOO-boo; Chinese: 拉布布; pinyin: Lābùbù) is a line of collectible plush toys created by Hong Kong illustrator Kasing Lung. The series features zoomorphic elves with exaggerated facial expressions, of which the central figure is Labubu, a monster with sharp teeth, large ears and a scruffy appearance.\nThe toys are produced and sold exclusively by the China-based retailer Pop Mart, which primarily releases Labubu figures in sealed \"blind box\" packaging that conceals the specific character inside. Over time, the series expanded to include different versions of Labubu and other related figures, often released in limited runs or as part of themed sets.\nLabubu quickly gained popularity across East and Southeast Asia, becoming one of Pop Mart’s signature characters and a central figure in the global blind box collecting trend. The character has also inspired collaborations with fashion brands and limited-edition art figures.\n\n\n== History ==\nLabubu began as a character designed by Kasing Lung (born 1972), a Hong Kong-born artist raised in Utrecht, Netherlands, who later settled in Antwerp, Belgium. Labubu was part of Lung's story series The Monsters, which was influenced by Nordic folklore and mythology that he enjoyed during his childhood.\nLabubu was first introduced in 2015 with \"Monsters\" figurines produced by the company How2Work; the toy gained wider recognition in 2019 following a collaboration with Pop Mart. This partnership boosted Labubu's popularity among collectors.\nBy 2025, Labubu had released over 300 different Labubu figurines, ranging in size and price, from US$15 for an eight-centimetre (3 in) vinyl figure to $960 for a 79-centimetre (31 in) \"mega\" edition. In June, a 1.2-metre-tall (4 ft) mint-green Labubu was sold for $170,000 at the first official Labubu auction, held in Beijing. An anime adaptation in 156 4- to 5-minute episodes in a 7-minute time-slot is planned to be broadcast in mid-2025.\nPop Mart CEO Wang Ning's 48.73% stake in the company has made him a US$21.1 billion fortune (as of 7 July 2025, up from $1.8 billion in 2024), making him the youngest member of China's top ten billionaire list at 37–38.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nPop Mart attributes a substantial share of its sales to Labubu’s IP, The Monsters. In its 2024 annual report, the company reported revenue of RMB 3.04 billion (roughly US$430 million) from The Monsters, equal to 23.3% of total revenue that year. In the first half of 2025, The Monsters generated RMB 4.81 billion (about US$670 million), accounting for 34.7% of Pop Mart’s revenue for the period.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nLabubus are described as having a playful yet slightly fierce look, featuring round, furry bodies, wide eyes, pointed ears, and nine sharp teeth that form a mischievous smile. Aside from Labubu herself, other figures also belong to a \"tribe\" called \"The Monsters\", including the characters Mokoko, Pato, Spooky, Tycoco (Labubu's \"skeleton-looking\" boyfriend), and Zimomo (the leader of The Monsters, with a spiked tail). The dolls have been produced with a variety of appearances.\nThe first Labubu key-ring line, titled \"Exciting Macaron\" (Chinese: 心動馬卡龍), was released in October 2023. Other collections include \"Fall in Wild\", the seven-figurine \"Have a Seat\" (Chinese: 坐坐派對) line, and \"Massive into Energy\" (Chinese: 大動力系列).\nPop Mart has also collaborated with various brands, producing a Coca-Cola–themed winter blind box series of eleven Labubus in late 2024 and a 13-figurine line of The Monsters re-imagined as characters from the manga and anime One Piece in early 2025. Other figures have been released exclusively at various museums, such as the \"Labubu's Artistic Quest\" series sold at Pop Mart's store at the Louvre in Paris.\n\n\n=== Blind boxes ===\nLabubu figures are often sold in blind boxes, collected into themed lines, which contain a toy chosen at random from that series. Series often contain a rare \"secret\" figure in addition to the designs advertised.\n\n\n== Popularity and public issues ==\n\nThe toy gained widespread attention in April 2024 after K-pop group Blackpink member Lisa was spotted with a keychain Labubu on her bag. This sparked a trend that quickly contributed to its growing recognition in Thailand and other parts of Southeast and East Asia. Labubus have also received endorsements from celebrities such as Rihanna and Cher, and have been used in promotional efforts for unrelated films, with actors like Javier Bardem interacting with the toys as part of marketing campaigns.\nIn 2025, New York magazine's Liza Corsillo wrote that the \"toy's appeal is fueled by a hard-to-explain cuteness—they're kind of ugly, but huggable, with a devilish grin—as well as surprise and scarcity.\" Corsillo also wrote that, like Jellycat, Labubus blur \"the line between toys and fashion\".\nDemand for Labubus has been high enough to crash the website on at least one occasion. Due to the brand's popularity, counterfeit versions, sometimes colloquially referred to as \"Lafufus\", have appeared in the market. Counterfeit accessories are also available for purchase online. Some collectors have reportedly also taken interest in these fakes, due to their unconventional designs.\nPop Mart's 2024 interim report, released on 20 August, stated that the line generated sales of 6.3 billion Chinese yuan (approximately US$870 million) in the first half of the year.\nIn May 2025, Pop Mart announced it had paused selling Labubus in all 16 of its stores in the United Kingdom until June to \"prevent any potential safety issues\" following multiple reports of customers fighting over them.\nThe Federation Council of Russia proposed banning the sale of Labubus. The reason was their \"frightening appearance\" and potential harm to children's mental health. In Russia, Ekaterina Altabaeva, deputy chair of the Committee on Science, Education and Culture, stated that the figures cause children to feel fear. She called on Rospotrebnadzor and Rosobrnadzor to consider banning them. Tatyana Butskaya, first deputy chair of the State Duma Committee on Family Protection, reported that Labubus were being sold in Russia in violation of regulations: according to her, there was not a single word in Russian on the toys, and the marking did not indicate that they were manufactured in Russia.\nIn July 2025, authorities in Iraq's Kurdistan Region announced they had banned the sale of the doll due to claims they resulted in behavioral problems in children. Authorities also seized at least 4,000 dolls in the Erbil area, following media reports of the dolls also containing 'demonic spirits'.\nThe New York Times noted the widespread cultural presence of Labubu toys, describing them as \"adorable furry monsters with sharp teeth\" and comparing their chaotic-cute appeal to popular film characters like Stitch (Lilo & Stitch) and Toothless (How to Train Your Dragon). The article credited Labubu with influencing the season's surge in cute sidekick characters across major studio films.\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\n\n=== Thai amulets ===\nIn 2024, due to the viral popularity of Labubu in Thailand, many Thais began to believe that its image could bring wealth and good fortune. As a result, it was made into Buddhist amulets and sacred tattoos.\n\n\n=== Political promotion ===\nIn September 2024, the People's Action Party (PAP) Sengkang team in Singapore held a grocery distribution event for senior citizens at Compassvale Crescent, Sengkang. During the event, a Labubu plush keychain dressed in a white shirt bearing the PAP logo was introduced. Lam Pin Min, chairman of the PAP Sengkang West branch, shared photos on social media of the doll participating in the event, describing it as the team's \"latest and cutest volunteer\". The doll appeared in the group's official photo and featured in a subsequent TikTok video.\n\n\n=== Nine Emperor Gods Festival ===\nIn October 2024, during the Nine Emperor Gods Festival, Singapore's Ling Lian Bao Dian Temple introduced collectible toy elements for the first time in an effort to attract younger generations to traditional religious practices. Four Labubu figurines were dressed as devotees, in white clothes, white hats, and yellow sashes, and participated throughout the festivities. The move drew widespread attention and debate on social media. While some praised the idea as cute and culturally innovative, others questioned whether it was disrespectful to the deities. The temple clarified that the toys were merely acting as \"devotees\" and were not being worshipped as offerings, hence no disrespect was intended. Videos of the event garnered high viewership on social media, drawing many young people to the temple to see the figurines in person.\n\n\n=== Psychological concerns and bans ===\nIn 2025, members of the Federation Council in Russia, including Ekaterina Altabaeva and Tatiana Butskaya, proposed banning Labubu dolls. They cited the doll's \"terrifying appearance\" and its potential negative influence on children's mental health, alongside the lack of Russian language labeling on packaging. Similarly, authorities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq seized over 4,000 Labubu dolls and imposed a ban, alleging that the toy could influence children's behavior and attract demonic spirits.\nLabubu has been associated with conspiracy theories linking it to the ancient Mesopotamian demon Pazuzu, primarily due to its sharp-toothed grin and eerie aesthetic. These theories gained popularity on platforms like TikTok and Reddit, with some users claiming supernatural experiences and even destroying their dolls in public. Pakistani actress Mishi Khan also voiced concern, warning that the dolls may attract negative spiritual energy or jinn. Designers and cultural analysts, however, have dismissed these claims, stating that the character draws from European folklore and does not contain occult symbolism.\n\n\n=== Marketing criticism and overconsumption ===\nLabubu is sold using a blind box model, which has been criticized for encouraging overconsumption and emotional dependency through artificial scarcity. Critics argue that this approach leads to obsessive collecting, financial exploitation, and the promotion of materialist values. Some editorials have referred to the fan culture surrounding Labubu as a reflection of modern consumer idolatry.\n\n\n=== Counterfeits and quality concerns ===\nThe popularity of Labubu has led to widespread counterfeiting. Imitation dolls, often called \"Lafufu\", have been sold globally, prompting legal action by Pop Mart, including a lawsuit against 7-Eleven in California for selling counterfeit toys. Generally, fake Labubus have invalid, blurry QR codes on the box and lack Pop Mart branding. Additionally, many fake Labubus have more than 9 teeth.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBeanie Babies – American brand of stuffed toys\nHello Kitty – Fictional character by Sanrio\nList of Sanrio characters\nMonchhichi – Line of Japanese stuffed animal toys\nSylvanian Families – Line of collectible animal figurines\nSonny Angel – Japanese collectible figurines\nTroll doll – Type of plastic doll with furry up-combed hair\nUglydoll – Plush toys\n\n\n== References ==",

        "title": "Vladimir Putin",
        "content": "Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (born 7 October 1952) is a Russian politician and former intelligence officer who has served as President of Russia since 2012, having previously served from 2000 to 2008. Putin also served as Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012.\nPutin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He resigned in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin's resignation, Putin became acting president and, less than four months later in May 2000, was elected to his first term as president. He was reelected in 2004. Due to constitutional limitations of two consecutive presidential terms, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev. He returned to the presidency in 2012, following an election marked by allegations of fraud and protests, and was reelected in 2018.\nDuring Putin's initial presidential tenure, the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year as a result of economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas. Additionally, Putin led Russia in a conflict against Chechen separatists, re-establishing federal control over the region. While serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms. In his third presidential term, Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions, resulting in international sanctions and a financial crisis in Russia. He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support his ally Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war, with the aim of obtaining naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nIn February 2022, during his fourth presidential term, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions. In September 2022, he announced a partial mobilization and forcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts into Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes related to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal child abductions during the war. In April 2021, after a referendum, he signed constitutional amendments into law that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036. In March 2024, he was reelected to another term.\nUnder Putin's rule, the Russian political system has been transformed into an authoritarian dictatorship with a personality cult. His rule has been marked by endemic corruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents, intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair elections. Russia has consistently received very low scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, The Economist Democracy Index, Freedom House's Freedom in the World index, and the Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPutin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia), the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin and Maria Ivanovna Putina (née Shelomova). His grandfather, Spiridon Putin, was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany's forces in World War II.\nPutin's mother was a factory worker, and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. During the early stage of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, his father served in the destruction battalion of the NKVD. Later, he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942. Putin's maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared on the Eastern Front during World War II.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nOn 1 September 1960, Putin started at School No. 193 at Baskov Lane, near his home. He was one of a few in his class of about 45 pupils who were not yet members of the Young Pioneer (Komsomol) organization. At the age of 12, he began to practice sambo and judo. In his free time, he enjoyed reading the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Lenin. Putin attended Saint Petersburg High School 281 with a German language immersion program. He is fluent in German and has given speeches and interviews in that language.\nPutin studied law at the Leningrad State University named after Andrei Zhdanov (now Saint Petersburg State University) in 1970 and graduated in 1975. His thesis was on \"The Most Favored Nation Trading Principle in International Law\". While there, he was required to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU); he remained a member until it ceased to exist in 1991. Putin met Anatoly Sobchak, an assistant professor who taught business law, and who later became the co-author of the Russian constitution. Putin was influential in Sobchak's career in Saint Petersburg, and Sobchak was influential in Putin's career in Moscow.\nIn 1997, Putin received a degree in economics (Candidate of Economical Sciences) at the Saint Petersburg Mining University for a thesis on energy dependencies and their instrumentalisation in foreign policy. His supervisor was Vladimir Litvinenko, who in 2000 and again in 2004 managed his presidential election campaigns in St Petersburg. Igor Danchenko and Clifford Gaddy consider Putin to be a plagiarist according to Western standards. One book from which he copied entire paragraphs is the Russian-language edition of King and Cleland's Strategic Planning and Policy (1978). Balzer wrote on the Putin thesis and Russian energy policy and concludes along with Olcott that \"The primacy of the Russian state in the country's energy sector is non-negotiable\", and cites the insistence on majority Russian ownership of any joint-venture, particularly since BASF signed the Gazprom Nord Stream-Yuzhno-Russkoye deal in 2004 with a 49–51 structure, as opposed to the older 50–50 split of BP's TNK-BP project.\n\n\n== Intelligence career ==\n\nIn 1975, Putin joined the KGB and trained at the 401st KGB School in Okhta, Leningrad. After training, he worked in the Second Chief Directorate (counterintelligence), before he was transferred to the First Chief Directorate, where he monitored foreigners and consular officials in Leningrad. In September 1984, Putin was sent to Moscow for further training at the Yuri Andropov Red Banner Institute.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1990, he served in Dresden, East Germany, using a cover identity as a translator. While posted in Dresden, Putin worked as one of the KGB's liaison officers to the Stasi secret police and was reportedly promoted to lieutenant colonel. According to the official Kremlin presidential site, the East German communist regime commended Putin with a bronze medal for \"faithful service to the National People's Army\". Putin has publicly conveyed delight over his activities in Dresden, once recounting his confrontations with anti-communist protestors of 1989 who attempted the occupation of Stasi buildings in the city.\n\"Putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings, thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the KGB\", Russian-American Masha Gessen wrote in their 2012 biography of Putin. His work was also downplayed by former Stasi spy chief Markus Wolf and Putin's former KGB colleague Vladimir Usoltsev. Journalist Catherine Belton wrote in 2020 that this downplaying was actually cover for Putin's involvement in KGB coordination and support for the terrorist Red Army Faction, whose members frequently hid in East Germany with the support of the Stasi. Dresden was preferred as a \"marginal\" town with only a small presence of Western intelligence services. According to an anonymous source who claimed to be a former RAF member, at one of these meetings in Dresden the militants presented Putin with a list of weapons that were later delivered to the RAF in West Germany. Klaus Zuchold, who claimed to be recruited by Putin, said that Putin handled a neo-Nazi, Rainer Sonntag, and attempted to recruit an author of a study on poisons. Putin reportedly met Germans to be recruited for wireless communications affairs together with an interpreter. He was involved in wireless communications technologies in South-East Asia due to trips of German engineers, recruited by him, there and to the West. However, a 2023 investigation by Der Spiegel reported that the anonymous source had never been an RAF member and is \"considered a notorious fabulist\" with \"several previous convictions, including for making false statements\".\nAccording to Putin's official biography, during the fall of the Berlin Wall that began on 9 November 1989, he saved the files of the Soviet Cultural Center (House of Friendship) and of the KGB villa in Dresden for the official authorities of the would-be united Germany to prevent demonstrators, including KGB and Stasi agents, from obtaining and destroying them. He then supposedly burnt only the KGB files, in a few hours, but saved the archives of the Soviet Cultural Center for the German authorities. Nothing is told about the selection criteria during this burning; for example, concerning Stasi files or about files of other agencies of the German Democratic Republic or of the USSR. He explained that many documents were left to Germany only because the furnace burst but many documents of the KGB villa were sent to Moscow.\nAfter the collapse of the Communist East German government, Putin was to resign from active KGB service because of suspicions aroused regarding his loyalty during demonstrations in Dresden and earlier, although the KGB and the Soviet Army still operated in eastern Germany. He returned to Leningrad in early 1990 as a member of the \"active reserves\", where he worked for about three months with the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University, reporting to Vice-Rector Yuriy Molchanov, while working on his doctoral dissertation.\nThere, he looked for new KGB recruits, watched the student body, and renewed his friendship with his former professor, Anatoly Sobchak, soon to be the Mayor of Leningrad. Putin said that he resigned with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 20 August 1991, on the second day of the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt against Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. Putin stated: \"As soon as the coup began, I immediately decided which side I was on\", although he said that the choice was hard because he had spent the best part of his life with \"the organs\".\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\nPutin's political rise began in the Saint Petersburg administration (1990–1996), where in May 1990 he was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to Mayor Anatoly Sobchak. Shortly thereafter, in June 1991, he became the head of the Committee for External Relations of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office, overseeing the promotion of international ties, foreign investment, and the registration of business ventures. Though his tenure was marred by investigations from the city legislative council concerning discrepancies in asset valuation and the export of metals, Putin retained his position until 1996. During the mid-1990s, he expanded his responsibilities in Saint Petersburg, serving as first deputy head of the city administration and leading the local branch of the pro-government political party Our Home Is Russia, as well as participating in advisory roles with regional newspapers.\n\nTransitioning to the national scene in 1996, Putin was called to Moscow following the electoral defeat of Sobchak, where he assumed the role of Deputy Chief of the Presidential Property Management Department. In this capacity, he was responsible for managing the transfer of former Soviet assets to the Russian Federation. His career in Moscow advanced rapidly with his appointment in 1997 as deputy chief of the Presidential Staff and later as chief of the Main Control Directorate of the same department. A pivotal moment came in 1998 when President Boris Yeltsin appointed him director of the FSB, Russia's primary intelligence and security agency. In this role, Putin concentrated on reorganising and strengthening the agency after years of perceived decline, a period that would prove formative for his later approach to governance.\nIn August 1999, Putin's profile increased substantially when he was named one of the three First Deputy Prime Ministers, and later the acting Prime Minister following the dismissal of Sergei Stepashin's cabinet. Endorsed by Yeltsin as his preferred successor, Putin quickly capitalised on his law-and-order reputation and rose in popularity, winning the presidential election in March 2000 and being inaugurated on 7 May 2000. Throughout his subsequent terms, alternately serving as President and Prime Minister, Putin has overseen extensive reforms aimed at consolidating state power, restructuring federal relations, and curbing the influence of oligarchs. His tenure has been punctuated by significant foreign policy actions, including the controversial annexation of Crimea in 2014, military interventions in Syria, and ongoing involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\n\n=== 2024–present: Fifth presidential term ===\n\nPutin won the 2024 Russian presidential election with 88% of the vote. International observers did not consider the election to be free or fair, with Putin having increased political repressions after launching his full-scale war with Ukraine in 2022. The elections were also held in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. There were reports of irregularities, including ballot stuffing and coercion, with statistical analysis suggesting unprecedented levels of fraud in the 2024 elections. In March 2024, the Crocus City Hall attack took place, causing the deaths of 145 people and injuring 551 more. It was the deadliest terrorist attack on Russian soil since the Beslan school siege in 2004.\nIn May 2024, Putin was inaugurated as president of Russia for the fifth time. According to analysts, replacing Sergei Shoigu with Andrey Belousov as defense minister signals that Putin wanted to transform the economy into a war economy and is \"preparing for many more years of war\". Four Russian sources told Reuters that Putin was ready to end the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that would recognize Russia's war gains and freeze the war on the then front lines, as Putin wanted to avoid unpopular steps such as further mobilization and increased war spending.\nIn August 2024, Putin pardoned American journalist Evan Gershkovich, opposition figures Vladimir Kara-Murza, Ilya Yashin and others  in a prisoner swap with western countries. The 2024 Ankara prisoner exchange was the most extensive between Russia and United States since the end of the Cold War, involving the release of 26 people.\nIn September 2024, Putin warned the West that if attacked with conventional weapons Russia would consider a nuclear retaliation, in an apparent deviation from the no first use doctrine. Putin went on to threaten nuclear powers that if they supported another country's attack on Russia, then they would be considered participants in such an aggression. Russia and the United States are the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding 88% of the world's nuclear weapons. Putin has made implicit nuclear threats since the outbreak of war against Ukraine. Experts say Putin's announcement was aimed at dissuading the US, UK and France from allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied long-range missiles such as the Storm Shadow and ATACMS in strikes against Russia.\nIn April 2025, US President Donald Trump criticized Putin's determination to continue the war against Ukraine despite the horrific death toll and called for a peace deal, posting on social media: \"Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!\" Putin rejected a proposal by the United States and Ukraine for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. In May 2025, Putin attended the Victory Day parade in Moscow with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Lula da Silva and other foreign leaders.\nIn May 2025, Putin approved Alexander Novak's coal industry bailout plan.\nOn 15 May 2025, Russian and Ukrainian delegations held direct talks in Istanbul for the first time since early 2022. As a condition for peace, Putin called on Ukraine to abandon four partially occupied Ukrainian regions that Russia has annexed but not conquered: a territorial concession that Ukraine has repeatedly rejected. He also listed other demands that critics say would lead to the end of Ukraine as a sovereign and independent state. Putin rejected calls for an unconditional ceasefire and escalated attacks on Ukraine.\nOn 22 June 2025, Putin condemned Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites as an \"unprovoked act of aggression,\" although at the same time he authorized Russian strikes against Ukraine. As of July 2025, Russian casualties in the war with Ukraine were estimated at 1 million.\n\n\n== Domestic policies ==\n\nPutin's domestic policies, particularly early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a vertical power structure. On 13 May 2000, he issued a decree organizing the 89 federal subjects of Russia into seven administrative federal districts and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts (whose official title is Plenipotentiary Representative).\n\nAccording to Stephen White, under the presidency of Putin, Russia made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a \"second edition\" of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions and circumstances. Some commentators have described Putin's administration as a \"sovereign democracy\". According to the proponents of that description (primarily Vladislav Surkov), the government's actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within Russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the country.\nThe practice of the system is characterized by Swedish economist Anders Åslund as manual management, commenting: \"After Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, his rule is best described as 'manual management' as the Russians like to put it. Putin does whatever he wants, with little consideration to the consequences with one important caveat. During the Russian financial crash of August 1998, Putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, he cares about financial stability\"\nThe period after 2012 saw mass protests against the falsification of elections, censorship and toughening of free assembly laws. In July 2000, according to a law proposed by Putin and approved by the Federal Assembly of Russia, Putin gained the right to dismiss the heads of the 89 federal subjects. In 2004, the direct election of those heads (usually called \"governors\") by popular vote was replaced with a system whereby they would be nominated by the president and approved or disapproved by regional legislatures.\nThis was seen by Putin as a necessary move to stop separatist tendencies and get rid of those governors who were connected with organised crime. This and other government actions effected under Putin's presidency have been criticized by many independent Russian media outlets and Western commentators as anti-democratic.\nDuring his first term in office, Putin opposed some of the Yeltsin-era business oligarchs, as well as his political opponents, resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky; other oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich and Arkady Rotenberg are friends and allies with Putin. Putin succeeded in codifying land law and tax law and promulgated new codes on labour, administrative, criminal, commercial and civil procedural law. Under Medvedev's presidency, Putin's government implemented some key reforms in the area of state security, the Russian police reform and the Russian military reform.\nIn 1999, Putin described communism as \"a blind alley, far away from the mainstream of civilization\".\n\n\n=== Economic, industrial, and energy policies ===\n\nSergey Guriyev, when talking about Putin's economic policy, divided it into four distinct periods: the \"reform\" years of his first term (1999–2003); the \"statist\" years of his second term (2004—the first half of 2008); the world economic crisis and recovery (the second half of 2008–2013); and the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia's growing isolation from the global economy, and stagnation (2014–present).\nIn 2000, Putin launched the \"Programme for the Socio-Economic Development of the Russian Federation for the Period 2000–2010\", but it was abandoned in 2008 when it was 30% complete. Fueled by the 2000s commodities boom including record-high oil prices, under the Putin administration from 2000 to 2016, an increase in income in USD terms was 4.5 times. During Putin's first eight years in office, industry grew substantially, as did production, construction, real incomes, credit, and the middle class. A fund for oil revenue allowed Russia to repay the Soviet Union's debts by 2005. Russia joined the World Trade Organization in August 2012.\nIn 2006, Putin launched an industry consolidation programme to bring the main aircraft-producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC). In September 2020, the UAC general director announced that the UAC will receive the largest-ever post-Soviet government support package for the aircraft industry in order to pay and renegotiate the debt.\n\nIn 2014, Putin signed a deal to supply China with 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Power of Siberia, which Putin has called the \"world's biggest construction project\", was launched in 2019 and is expected to continue for 30 years at an ultimate cost to China of $400bn. The ongoing financial crisis began in the second half of 2014 when the Russian ruble collapsed due to a decline in the price of oil and international sanctions against Russia. These events in turn led to loss of investor confidence and capital flight, although it has also been argued that the sanctions had little to no effect on Russia's economy. In 2014, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project named Putin their Person of the Year for furthering corruption and organized crime.\nAccording to Meduza, Putin has since 2007 predicted on a number of occasions that Russia will become one of the world's five largest economies. In 2013, he said Russia was one of the five biggest economies in terms of gross domestic product but still lagged behind other countries on indicators such as labour productivity. By the end of 2023, Putin planned to spend almost 40% of public expenditures on defense and security.\n\n\n=== Environmental policy ===\n\nIn 2004, Putin signed the Kyoto Protocol treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, Russia did not face mandatory cuts, because the Kyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from 1990 levels and Russia's greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union, excluding emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).\nIn 2019 Russia joined the Paris Agreement. Russia's goal is to reach net zero by 2060, but its energy strategy to 2035 is mostly about burning more fossil fuels. Reporting military emissions is voluntary and, as of 2024, no data is available since before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\nPutin described climate change as a concerning fact with big consequences for Russia. He is not sure if it man made or not, but said that Russia is trying and will try to reduce man made emissions with forests and \"low-emission energy\", by this term he intends Natural gas, Nuclear energy and Hydroenergy in Russia. He said that rich countries should provide finance and technology to those with less money for lower emissions. Some describe his policy as \"mimicry of climate policy\" and say he turned environmentalism into tool of political influence.\n\n\n=== Religious policy ===\n\nPutin regularly attends the most important services of the Russian Orthodox Church on the main holy days and has established a good relationship with Patriarchs of the Russian Church, the late Alexy II of Moscow and the current Kirill of Moscow. As president, Putin took an active personal part in promoting the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate, signed 17 May 2007, which restored relations between the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia after the 80-year schism.\nUnder Putin, the Hasidic Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia became increasingly influential within the Jewish community, partly due to the influence of Federation-supporting businessmen mediated through their alliances with Putin, notably Lev Leviev and Roman Abramovich. According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Putin is popular amongst the Russian Jewish community, who see him as a force for stability. Russia's chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, said Putin \"paid great attention to the needs of our community and related to us with a deep respect\". In 2016, Ronald S. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, also praised Putin for making Russia \"a country where Jews are welcome\".\nHuman rights organizations and religious freedom advocates have criticized the state of religious freedom in Russia. In 2016, Putin oversaw the passage of legislation that prohibited missionary activity in Russia. Nonviolent religious minority groups have been repressed under anti-extremism laws, especially Jehovah's Witnesses. One of the 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia directly refers to belief in God.\n\n\n=== Military development ===\n\nThe resumption of long-distance flights of Russia's strategic bombers was followed by the announcement by Russian defense minister Anatoliy Serdyukov during his meeting with Putin on 5 December 2007, that 11 ships, including the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov, would take part in the first major navy sortie into the Mediterranean since Soviet times.\nKey elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million, reducing the number of officers, centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 systemic military training centres, creating a professional NCO corps, reducing the size of the central command, introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff, elimination of cadre-strength formations, reorganising the reserves, reorganising the army into a brigade system, and reorganising air forces into an airbase system instead of regiments.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin, Putin embarked on a build-up of Russia's nuclear capabilities because of U.S. president George W. Bush's unilateral decision to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. To counter what Putin sees as the United States' goal of undermining Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent, Moscow has embarked on a program to develop new weapons capable of defeating any new American ballistic missile defense or interception system. Some analysts believe that this nuclear strategy under Putin has brought Russia into violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\nAccordingly, U.S. president Donald Trump announced the U.S. would no longer consider itself bound by the treaty's provisions, raising nuclear tensions between the two powers. This prompted Putin to state that Russia would not launch first in a nuclear conflict but that \"an aggressor should know that vengeance is inevitable, that he will be annihilated, and we would be the victims of the aggression. We will go to heaven as martyrs\".\nPutin has also sought to increase Russian territorial claims in the Arctic and its military presence there. In August 2007, Russian expedition Arktika 2007, part of research related to the 2001 Russian territorial extension claim, planted a flag on the seabed at the North Pole. Both Russian submarines and troops deployed in the Arctic have been increasing.\n\n\n=== Human rights policy ===\n\nNew York City–based NGO Human Rights Watch, in a report titled Laws of Attrition, authored by Hugh Williamson, the British director of HRW's Europe & Central Asia Division, has claimed that since May 2012, when Putin was reelected as president, Russia has enacted many restrictive laws, started inspections of non-governmental organizations, harassed, intimidated and imprisoned political activists, and started to restrict critics. The new laws include the \"foreign agents\" law, which is widely regarded as over-broad by including Russian human rights organizations which receive some international grant funding, the treason law, and the assembly law which penalizes many expressions of dissent. Human rights activists have criticized Russia for censoring speech of LGBT activists due to \"the gay propaganda law\" and increasing violence against LGBT+ people due to the law.\nIn 2020, Putin signed a law on labelling individuals and organizations receiving funding from abroad as \"foreign agents\". The law is an expansion of \"foreign agent\" legislation adopted in 2012.\nAs of June 2020, per Memorial Human Rights Center, there were 380 political prisoners in Russia, including 63 individuals prosecuted, directly or indirectly, for political activities (including Alexey Navalny) and 245 prosecuted for their involvement with one of the Muslim organizations that are banned in Russia. 78 individuals on the list, i.e., more than 20% of the total, are residents of Crimea. As of December 2022, more than 4,000 people were prosecuted for criticizing the war in Ukraine under Russia's war censorship laws.\n\n\n=== The media ===\n\nScott Gehlbach, a professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has claimed that since 1999, Putin has systematically punished journalists who challenge his official point of view. Maria Lipman, an American writing in Foreign Affairs claims, \"The crackdown that followed Putin's return to the Kremlin in 2012 extended to the liberal media, which had until then been allowed to operate fairly independently\". The Internet has attracted Putin's attention because his critics have tried to use it to challenge his control of information. Marian K. Leighton, who worked for the CIA as a Soviet analyst in the 1980s says, \"Having muzzled Russia's print and broadcast media, Putin focused his energies on the Internet\".\nRobert W. Orttung and Christopher Walker reported that \"Reporters Without Borders, for instance, ranked Russia 148 in its 2013 list of 179 countries in terms of freedom of the press. It particularly criticized Russia for the crackdown on the political opposition and the failure of the authorities to vigorously pursue and bring to justice criminals who have murdered journalists. Freedom House ranks Russian media as \"not free\", indicating that basic safeguards and guarantees for journalists and media enterprises are absent. About two-thirds of Russians use television as their primary source of daily news, while around 85% of Russians get most of their information from Russian state media.\nIn the early 2000s, Putin and his circle began promoting the idea in Russian media that they are the modern-day version of the 17th-century Romanov tsars who ended Russia's \"Time of Troubles\", meaning they claim to be the peacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the Soviet Union. Since the 2022 Ukraine invasion, Putin has only once granted an interview to a Western journalist, namely Tucker Carlson in February 2024.\n\n\n=== Promoting conservatism ===\n\nPutin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural, and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and neoliberalism and is identified by scholars with Russian conservatism. Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by the conservative right-wing journalist Alexander Prokhanov, stresses (i) Russian nationalism, (ii) the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and (iii) systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies. Vladislav Surkov, a senior government official, has been one of the key economics consultants during Putin's presidency.\nIn cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin's terms were like \"a miracle of God\". Steven Myers reports, \"The church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions... Now Kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state\".\nMark Woods, a Baptist Union of Great Britain minister and contributing editor to Christian Today, provides specific examples of how the Church has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Some Russian Orthodox believers consider Putin a corrupt and brutal strongman or even a tyrant. Others do not admire him but appreciate that he aggravates their political opponents. Still others appreciate that Putin defends some although not all Orthodox teachings, whether or not he believes in them himself.\nOn abortion, Putin stated: \"In the modern world, the decision is up to the woman herself\". This put him at odds with the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2020, he supported efforts to reduce the number of abortions instead of prohibiting it. On 28 November 2023, during a speech to the World Russian People's Council, Putin urged Russian women to have \"seven, eight, or even more children\" and said \"large families must become the norm, a way of life for all of Russia's people\".\nPutin supported the 2020 Russian constitutional referendum, which passed and defined marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman in the Constitution of Russia.\n\n\n=== International sporting events ===\n\nIn 2007, Putin led a successful effort on behalf of Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics, the first Winter Olympic Games to ever be hosted by Russia. In 2008, the city of Kazan won the bid for the 2013 Summer Universiade; on 2 December 2010, Russia won the right to host the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup, also for the first time in Russian history. In 2013, Putin stated that gay athletes would not face any discrimination at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\n\n== Foreign policy ==\n\nGenerally, Putin's tenure experiences tensions with the west. Anna Borshchevskaya, in her 2022 book, summarizes Putin main foreign policy objectives as originating in his 30 December 1999 document which appeared on the government's website, \"Russia at the Turn of the Millenium\". She presents Putin as orienting himself to the plan that \"Russia is a country with unique values in danger of losing its unity – which... is a historic Russian fear. This again points to the fundamental issue of Russia's identity issues – and how the state had manipulated these to drive anti-Western security narratives with the aim of eroding the US-led global order... Moreover, a look at Russia's distribution of forces over the years under Putin has been heavily weighted towards the south (Syria, Ukraine, Middle East), another indicator of the Kremlin's threat perceptions\".\nLeonid Bershidsky analyzed Putin's interview with the Financial Times and concluded, \"Putin is an imperialist of the old Soviet school, rather than a nationalist or a racist, and he has cooperated with, and promoted, people who are known to be gay\". Putin spoke favorably of artificial intelligence in regard to foreign policy, \"Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world\".\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n\nIn 2012, Putin wrote an article in Indian newspaper The Hindu, saying: \"The Declaration on Strategic Partnership between India and Russia signed in October 2000 became a truly historic step\". India remains the largest customer of Russian military equipment, and the two countries share a historically strong strategic and diplomatic relationship. In October 2022, Putin described India and China as \"close allies and partners\".\nUnder Putin, Russia has maintained positive relations with the Asian states of SCO and BRICS, which include China, India, Pakistan, and post-Soviet states of Central Asia. In the 21st century, Sino-Russian relations have significantly strengthened bilaterally and economically—the Treaty of Friendship, and the construction of the ESPO oil pipeline and the Power of Siberia gas pipeline formed a \"special relationship\" between the two great powers.\nPutin and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe frequently met each other to discuss the Japan–Russia territorial disputes. Putin also voiced his willingness of constructing a rail bridge between the two countries. Despite numerous meetings, no agreement was signed before Abe's resignation in 2020.\n\nPutin made three visits to Mongolia and has enjoyed good relations with its neighbor. Putin and his Mongolian counterpart signed a permanent treaty on friendship between the two states in September 2019, further enhancing trade and cultural exchanges. Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit Indonesia in half a century in 2007, resulting in the signing of an arms deal. In another visit, Putin commented on long-standing ties and friendship between Russia and Indonesia. Russia has also boosted relations with Vietnam after 2011, and with Afghanistan in the 2010s, giving military and economic aid. The relations between Russia and the Philippines received a boost in 2016 as Putin forged closer bilateral ties with his Filipino counterpart, Rodrigo Duterte. Putin has good relations with Malaysia and its then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Putin also made the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit North Korea, meeting Kim Jong Il in July 2000, shortly after a visit to South Korea.\nPutin criticized violence in Myanmar against Rohingya minorities in 2017. Following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état, Russia has pledged to boost ties with the Myanmar military regime.\n\n\n=== Post-Soviet states ===\n\nUnder Putin, the Kremlin has consistently stated that Russia has a sphere of influence and \"privileged interests\" over other Post-Soviet states, which are referred to as the \"near abroad\" in Russia. It has also been stated that the post-Soviet states are strategically vital to Russian interests. Some Russia experts have compared this concept to the Monroe Doctrine.\nA series of so-called colour revolutions in the post-Soviet states, namely the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in 2005, led to frictions in the relations of those countries with Russia. In December 2004, Putin criticized the Rose and Orange revolutions, saying: \"If you have permanent revolutions you risk plunging the post-Soviet space into endless conflict\".\nPutin allegedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine joined NATO Russia could contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea. At the summit, he told U.S. president George W. Bush that \"Ukraine is not even a state!\", while the following year Putin referred to Ukraine as \"Little Russia\". Following the Revolution of Dignity in March 2014, the Russian Federation annexed Crimea. According to Putin, this was done because \"Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia\".\nAfter the Russian annexation of Crimea, he said that Ukraine includes \"regions of Russia's historic south\" and \"was created on a whim by the Bolsheviks\". He went on to declare that the February 2014 ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had been orchestrated by the West as an attempt to weaken Russia. \"Our Western partners have crossed a line. They behaved rudely, irresponsibly and unprofessionally\", he said, adding that the people who had come to power in Ukraine were \"nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites\".\n\nIn a July 2014 speech during a Russian-supported armed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine, Putin stated he would use Russia's \"entire arsenal of available means\" up to \"operations under international humanitarian law and the right of self-defence\" to protect Russian speakers outside Russia. With the attainment of autocephaly by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in December 2018 and subsequent schism of the Russian Orthodox Church from Constantinople, a number of experts came to the conclusion that Putin's policy of forceful engagement in post-Soviet republics significantly backfired on him, leading to a situation where he \"annexed Crimea, but lost Ukraine\", and provoked a much more cautious approach to Russia among other post-Soviet countries.\nIn late August 2014, Putin stated: \"People who have their own views on history and the history of our country may argue with me, but it seems to me that the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are practically one people\". After making a similar statement, in late December 2015 he stated: \"the Ukrainian culture, as well as Ukrainian literature, surely has a source of its own\". In July 2021, he published a lengthy article On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians revisiting these themes, and saying the formation of a Ukrainian state hostile to Moscow was \"comparable in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us\"—it was made mandatory reading for military-political training in the Russian Armed Forces.\n\nIn August 2008, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili attempted to restore control over the breakaway South Ossetia. However, the Georgian military was soon defeated in the resulting 2008 South Ossetia War after regular Russian forces entered South Ossetia and then other parts of Georgia, then also opened a second front in the other Georgian breakaway province of Abkhazia with Abkhazian forces.\nDespite existing or past tensions between Russia and most of the post-Soviet states, Putin has followed the policy of Eurasian integration. Putin endorsed the idea of a Eurasian Union in 2011; the concept was proposed by the president of Kazakhstan in 1994. On 18 November 2011, the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement setting a target of establishing the Eurasian Union by 2015. The Eurasian Union was established on 1 January 2015.\nUnder Putin, Russia's relations have improved significantly with Uzbekistan, the second largest post-Soviet republic after Ukraine. This was demonstrated in Putin's visit to Tashkent in May 2000, after lukewarm relations under Yeltsin and Islam Karimov who had long distanced itself from Moscow. In another meeting in 2014, Russia agreed to write off Uzbek debt. A theme of a greater Soviet region, including the former USSR and many of its neighbors or imperial-era states—rather than just post-Soviet Russia—has been consistent in Putin's May Day speeches.\nOn 22 December 2022, Putin addressed the Security Council in a speech where he did not use the term \"Special Military Operation\" but instead called the fighting in Ukraine a \"war\". Anti-Putin activists have called for Putin to be prosecuted for breaking a law passed to stop people calling the Special Military Operation a war. This law carries a penalty of up to 15 years in jail. On 25 December, he openly declared in a TV interview that the goal of the invasion is \"to unite the Russian people\".\nOn 14 December 2023, President Putin held a press conference where he indicated that Russian would only negotiate with Ukraine \"when we achieve our objectives\". He stated that another mobilization wasn't required as \"617,000\" Russian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine.\nDuring the 2024 Year-End Review, President Putin was asked if there were regrets from the \"Special Military Operation\". President Putin said that he regretted not launching it at the same time as the annexation of Crimea and with more \"preparation\". Saying \"This decision, which was made at the beginning of 2022, should have been made earlier. That's the first thing. Secondly, we should have started preparing, including for the SMO. The events in Crimea were spontaneous. The events of 2022 also began without preparation. But why did we start? Because it was impossible to stand still and endure any longer\".\n\n\n=== United States, Western Europe, and NATO ===\n\nUnder Putin, Russia's relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed through several stages. When he first became president, relations were cautious, but after the 9/11 attacks Putin quickly supported the U.S. in the War on Terror and the opportunity for partnership appeared. According to Stephen F. Cohen, the U.S. \"repaid by further expansion of NATO to Russia's borders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty\", but others pointed out the applications from new countries willing to join NATO was driven primarily by Russian's behavior in Chechnya, Transnistria, Abkhazia, Yanayev putsch as well as calls to restore USSR in its previous borders by prominent Russian politicians.\nFrom 2003, when Russia strongly opposed the U.S. when it waged the Iraq War, Putin became ever more distant from the West, and relations steadily deteriorated. According to Russia scholar Stephen F. Cohen, the narrative of the mainstream U.S. media, following that of the White House, became anti-Putin. In an interview with Michael Stürmer, Putin said there were three questions which most concerned Russia and Eastern Europe: namely, the status of Kosovo, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and American plans to build missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and suggested that all three were linked. His view was that concessions by the West on one of the questions might be met with concessions from Russia on another.\n\nIn a January 2007 interview, Putin said Russia was in favor of a democratic multipolar world and strengthening the systems of international law. In February 2007, Putin criticized what he called the United States' monopolistic dominance in global relations, and \"almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations\". He said the result of it is that \"no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race.\" This came to be known as the Munich Speech, and NATO secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called the speech \"disappointing and not helpful\".\nThe months following Putin's Munich Speech were marked by tension and a surge in rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic. Both Russian and American officials, however, denied the idea of a new Cold War. Putin publicly opposed plans for the U.S. missile shield in Europe and presented President George W. Bush with a counterproposal on 7 June 2007 which was declined. Russia suspended its participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty on 11 December 2007.\nPutin opposed Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, warning that it would destabilize the whole system of international relations. He described the recognition of Kosovo's independence by several major world powers as \"a terrible precedent, which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations, developed not over decades, but over centuries\", and that \"they have not thought through the results of what they are doing. At the end of the day it is a two-ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face\". In March 2014, Putin used Kosovo's declaration of independence as a justification for recognizing the independence of Crimea, citing the so-called \"Kosovo independence precedent\".\nAfter the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. in 2001, Putin had good relations with American president George W. Bush, and many western European leaders. His \"cooler\" and \"more business-like\" relationship with German chancellor, Angela Merkel is often attributed to Merkel's upbringing in the former DDR, where Putin was stationed as a KGB agent. He had a very friendly and warm relationship with Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi; the two leaders often described their relationship as a close friendship, continuing to organize bilateral meetings even after Berlusconi's resignation in November 2011. When Berlusconi died in 2023, Putin described him as an \"extraordinary man\" and a \"true friend\".\nThe NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011 prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders, including Putin, who said that the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 is \"defective and flawed\", adding: \"It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for crusades\".\nIn late 2013, Russian-American relations deteriorated further when the United States canceled a summit for the first time since 1960 after Putin gave asylum to American Edward Snowden, who had leaked massive amounts of classified information from the NSA. In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8 group as a result of its annexation of Crimea. Putin gave a speech highly critical of the United States, accusing them of destabilizing world order and trying to \"reshape the world\" to its own benefit. In June 2015, Putin said that Russia has no intention of attacking NATO.\nOn 9 November 2016, Putin congratulated Donald Trump on becoming the 45th president of the United States. In December 2016, US intelligence officials (headed by James Clapper) quoted by CBS News stated that Putin approved the email hacking and cyber attacks during the U.S. election, against the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. A spokesman for Putin denied the reports. Putin has repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton, who served as U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 of interfering in Russia's internal affairs, and in December 2016, Clinton accused Putin of having a personal grudge against her.\nWith the election of Trump, Putin's favorability in the U.S. increased. A Gallup poll in February 2017 revealed a positive view of Putin among 22% of Americans, the highest since 2003. Putin has stated that U.S.–Russian relations, already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, have continued to deteriorate after Trump took office in January 2017.\nOn 18 June 2020, The National Interest published a nine-thousand-word essay by Putin, titled \"The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War II\". In the essay, Putin criticizes the Western historical view of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as the start of World War II, stating that the Munich Agreement was the beginning.\nOn 21 February 2023, Putin suspended Russia's participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States. On 25 March, President Putin announced the stationing of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Russia would maintain control of the weapons. President Putin told Russian TV: \"There is nothing unusual here either. Firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades. They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries\".\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nIn 2003, relations between Russia and the United Kingdom deteriorated when the United Kingdom granted political asylum to Putin's former patron, oligarch Boris Berezovsky. This deterioration was intensified by allegations that the British were spying and making secret payments to pro-democracy and human rights groups. A survey conducted in the United Kingdom in 2022 found Putin to be among the least popular foreign leaders, with 8% of British respondents holding a positive opinion.\n\n\n==== Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko ====\n\nThe end of 2006 brought more strained relations in the wake of the death by polonium poisoning in London of former KGB and FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who became an MI6 agent in 2003. In 2007, the crisis in relations continued with the expulsion of four Russian envoys over Russia's refusal to extradite former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi to face charges in the murder. Mirroring the British actions, Russia expelled UK diplomats and took other retaliatory steps.\nIn 2015, the British Government launched a public inquiry into Litvinenko's death, presided over by Robert Owen, a former British High Court judge. The Owen report, published on 21 January 2016, stated, \"The FSB operation to kill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr Patrushev and also by President Putin\". The report outlined some possible motives for the murder, including Litvinenko's public statements and books about the alleged involvement of the FSB in mass murder, and what was \"undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism\" between Putin and Litvinenko.\n\n\n==== Poisoning of Sergei Skripal ====\n\nOn 4 March 2018, former double agent Sergei Skripal was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury. Ten days later, the British government formally accused the Russian state of attempted murder, a charge which Russia denied. After the UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats (an action which would later be responded to with a Russian expulsion of 23 British diplomats), British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on 16 March that it was \"overwhelmingly likely\" Putin had personally ordered the poisoning of Skripal. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegation \"shocking and unpardonable diplomatic misconduct\".\n\n\n=== Latin America ===\n\nPutin and his successor, Medvedev, enjoyed warm relations with Hugo Chávez of Venezuela. Much of this has been through the sale of military equipment; since 2005, Venezuela has purchased more than $4 billion worth of arms from Russia. In September 2008, Russia sent Tupolev Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela to carry out training flights. In November 2008, both countries held a joint naval exercise in the Caribbean. Earlier in 2000, Putin had re-established stronger ties with Fidel Castro's Cuba.\n\"You express the best masculine qualities\", Putin told Jair Bolsonaro in 2020. \"You look for solutions in all matters, always putting above all the interests of your people, your country, leaving out your own personal issues\". Political scientist Oliver Stuenkel noted, \"Among Brazil's right-wing populists, Putin is seen as someone who is anti-woke, and that is seen as something that is definitely appealing to Bolsonaro. He is a strongman, and that is very inspiring to Bolsonaro. He would like to be someone who concentrates as much power\".\n\n\n=== Australia and the South Pacific ===\n\nIn September 2007, Putin visited Indonesia, the first Russian leader to do so in over 50 years. In the same month, Putin also attended the APEC meeting held in Sydney, Australia, where he met with Prime Minister John Howard and signed a uranium trade deal for Australia to sell uranium to Russia. This was the first visit by a Russian president to Australia. Putin again visited Australia for 2014 G20 Brisbane summit. The Abbott government denounced Putin's use of military force in Ukraine in 2014 as \"bullying\" and \"utterly unacceptable\".\nAmid calls to ban Putin from attending the 2014 G20 Summit, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he would \"shirtfront\" (challenge) the Russian leader over the shooting down of MH17 by Russian-backed rebels, which had killed 38 Australians. Putin denied responsibility for the killings.\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said the invasion was \"unprovoked, unjust and illegal\" and labeled Putin a \"thug\". New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern denounced Putin as a \"bully\". Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama tweeted, \"Fiji and our fellow Pacific Island Countries have united as nations of peace-loving people to condemn the conflict in Ukraine\", while the Solomon Islands UN ambassador called the invasion a \"violation of the rule of law\".\n\n\n=== Middle East and Africa ===\n\nOn 16 October 2007, Putin visited Iran to participate in the Second Caspian Summit in Tehran, where he met with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. This was the first visit of a Soviet or Russian leader to Iran since Joseph Stalin's participation in the Tehran Conference in 1943, and marked a significant event in Iran–Russia relations. At a press conference after the summit Putin said that \"all our (Caspian) states have the right to develop their peaceful nuclear programmes without any restrictions\". Putin was quoted as describing Iran as a \"partner\", although he expressed concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme.\nIn April 2008, Putin became the first Russian president to visit Libya. Putin condemned the 2011 foreign military intervention in Libya, referring to the UN resolution as \"defective and flawed\", and added, \"It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for crusades\". Upon the death of Muammar Gaddafi, Putin called it as \"planned murder\" by the US, saying: \"They showed to the whole world how he (Gaddafi) was killed\", and \"There was blood all over. Is that what they call a democracy?\"\nFrom 2000 to 2010, Russia sold around $1.5 billion worth of arms to Syria, making Damascus Russia's seventh-largest client. During the Syrian civil war, Russia threatened to veto any sanctions against the Syrian government, and continued to supply arms to its regime.\nPutin opposed any foreign intervention in the Syrian civil war. In June 2012, in Paris, he rejected the statement of French president François Hollande who called on Bashar al-Assad to step down. Putin echoed Assad's argument that anti-regime militants were responsible for much of the bloodshed. He also talked about previous NATO interventions and their results, and asked, \"What is happening in Libya, in Iraq? Did they become safer? Where are they heading? Nobody has an answer\".\nOn 11 September 2013, The New York Times published an op-ed by Putin urging caution against US intervention in Syria and criticizing American exceptionalism. Putin subsequently helped to arrange for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons. In 2015, he took a stronger pro-Assad stance and mobilized military support for the regime. Some analysts have summarized Putin as being allied with Shias and Alawites in the Middle East. Putin ordered Russian intervention to support his ally Assad, with the aim of obtaining naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nIn 2017, Putin dispatched Russian PMCs to back the Touadéra regime in the Central African Republic Civil War, gaining a permanent military presence in return. The first Russia-Africa Summit was held in October 2019 in Sochi, Russia, co-hosted by Putin and Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The meeting was attended by 43 heads of state and government from African countries.\nIn October 2019, Putin visited the United Arab Emirates, where six agreements were struck with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. One of them included shared investments between Russian sovereign wealth fund and the Emirati investment fund Mubadala. The two nations signed deals worth over $1.3bn, in energy, health and advance technology sectors. On 22 October 2021, Putin highlighted the \"unique bond\" between Russia and Israel during a meeting with Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett.\n\n\n== Public image ==\n\n\n=== Polls and rankings ===\nIn a June 2007 public opinion survey, Putin's approval rating was 81%, the second-highest of any leader in the world that year. In January 2013, at the time of the 2011–2013 Russian protests, Putin's rating fell to 62%, the lowest since 2000. In a context of increased diplomatic isolation and international sanctions on Russian officials prompted by the Russo-Ukrainian war, Putin's approval rating reached 87% in August 2014. In February 2015, based on domestic polling, Putin was ranked the world's most popular politician. In June 2015, Putin's approval rating climbed to 89%, an all-time high. Observers saw Putin's high approval ratings in 2010s as a consequence of improvements in living standards, and Russia's reassertion on the world scene during his presidency. Putin was also highly popular in some non-Western countries, such as Vietnam, where his approval rating was 89% in 2017.\nDespite high approval for Putin, public confidence in the Russian economy was low, dropping to levels in 2016 that rivaled the lows in 2009 at the height of the global economic crisis. Putin's performance in reining in corruption is unpopular among Russians. Newsweek reported in 2017 that a poll \"indicated that 67% held Putin personally responsible for high-level corruption\". Corruption is a significant problem in Russia.\nIn October 2018, two-thirds of Russians surveyed agreed that \"Putin bears full responsibility for the problems of the country\", which has been attributed to a decline in a popular belief in \"good tsar and bad boyars\", a traditional attitude towards justifying failures at the top of the ruling hierarchy in Russia. In January 2019, the percentage of Russians trusting Putin hit a then-historic low—33%. In April 2019 Gallup poll showed a record number of Russians, 20%, willing to permanently emigrate from Russia. The decline was even larger in the 17–25 age group, \"who find themselves largely disconnected from the country's aging leadership, nostalgic Soviet rhetoric and nepotistic agenda\". Putin's approval rating among young Russians was 32% in January 2019. The percentage willing to emigrate permanently in this group was 41%. 60% had favorable views of the US (three times more than in the 55+ age group). Decline in support for the president and government is visible in other polls, such as a rapidly growing readiness to protest against poor living conditions.\nIn May 2020, amid the COVID crisis, Putin's approval rating was 68%, when respondents were presented a list of names (closed question), and 27% when respondents were expected to name politicians they trust (open question). This has been attributed to continued post-Crimea economic stagnation but also an apathetic response to the pandemic crisis in Russia. Polls conducted in November 2021 after the failure of a Russian COVID-19 vaccination campaign indicated distrust of Putin was a major contributing factor for vaccine hesitancy, with regional polls indicating numbers as low as 20–30% in the Volga Federal District.\nIn May 2021, 33% indicated Putin in response to \"who would you vote for this weekend?\" among Moscow respondents and 40% outside Moscow. A survey released in October 2021 found 53% of respondents saying they trusted Putin.\nObservers see a generational struggle among Russians over perception of Putin's rule, with younger Russians more probably to be against Putin and older Russians more likely to accept the narrative presented by state-controlled media in Russia. Putin's support among Russians aged 18–24 was only 20% in December 2020.\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, state-controlled TV, where most Russians get their news, presented the invasion as a \"special military operation\" and liberation mission, in line with the government's narrative. The Russian censorship apparatus Roskomnadzor ordered the country's media to employ information only from state sources or face fines and blocks. The Russian media was banned from using the words \"war\", \"invasion\" or \"aggression\" to describe the invasion, with media outlets being blocked as a result.\nIn late February 2022, a survey conducted by the independent research group Russian Field found that 59% of respondents supported the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. According to the poll, in the group of 18-to-24-year-olds, only 29% supported the \"special military operation\". In late February and mid-March 2022 two polls surveyed Russians' sentiments about the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. The results were obtained by Radio Liberty. 71% of Russians polled said that they supported the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\nWhen asked how they were affected by the actions of Putin, a third said they strongly believed Putin was working in their interests. Another 26% said he was working in their interests to some extent. In general, most Russians believe that it would be better if Putin remained president for as long as possible. Similarly, a survey conducted in early March found 58% of Russian respondents approved of the operation.\nIn March 2022, 97% of Ukrainians said they had an unfavorable view of Putin, and 98% of Ukrainians—including 82% of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine—said they did not believe any part of Ukraine was rightfully part of Russia. A poll published on 30 March in Russia saw Putin's approval rating jump, from 71% in February, to 83%. However, experts warned that the figures may not accurately reflect the public mood, as the public tends to rally around leaders during war and some may be hiding their true opinions, especially with the Russian 2022 war censorship laws prohibiting dissemination of \"fake information\" about the military. Many respondents do not want to answer pollsters' questions for fear of negative consequences. When researchers commissioned a survey on Russians' attitudes to the war, 29,400 out of 31,000 refused to answer. The Levada Center's director, stated that early feelings of \"shock and confusion\" was being replaced with the belief that Russia was being besieged and that Russians must rally around their leader. The Kremlin's analysis concluded that public support for the war was broad but not deep, and that most Russians would accept anything Putin labeled a victory. In September 2023, the head of the VTsIOM state pollster Valery Fyodorov said in an interview that only 10–15% of Russians actively supported the war, and that \"most Russians are not demanding the conquest of Kyiv or Odesa\".\nA poll by the independent organization Levada, which was conducted on 22–28 June 2023, showed that 42% of respondents would vote for Putin in the 2024 presidential election. A public opinion poll by the state-owned institution VCIOM, which was conducted in November 2023, found that 37.3% of respondents would vote for Putin. According to a VCIOM poll conducted in early March 2024, 56.2% of respondents would vote for Putin.\nThe director of the Levada Center stated in 2015 that drawing conclusions from Russian poll results or comparing them to polls in democratic states was irrelevant, as there is no real political competition in Russia, where, unlike in democratic states, Russian voters are not offered any credible alternatives and public opinion is primarily formed by state-controlled media, which promotes those in power and discredits alternative candidates.\n\n\n=== Cult of personality ===\n\nPutin has cultivated a cult of personality for himself with an outdoorsy, athletic, tough guy public image, demonstrating his physical prowess and taking part in unusual or dangerous acts, such as extreme sports and interaction with wild animals, part of a public relations approach that, according to Wired, \"deliberately cultivates the macho, take-charge superhero image\". In 2007, the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda published a huge photograph of a shirtless Putin vacationing in the Siberian mountains under the headline \"Be Like Putin\". Tatiana Mikhailova opines that virility is an aspect of the image of the Father of the Nation, which Putin wants to create. She refers to, as an example of the success of this image building attempt, a 2006 incident in which Putin lifted the shirt of a boy to kiss his stomach without permission – which did not cause much reaction in Russia even though, according to Mikhailova, it was unprecedented and transgressive by Russian standards and would have caused outrage in any other country (media reports note that there was widespread reaction in Russia and abroad though).\nNumerous Kremlinologists have accused Putin of seeking to create a cult of personality around himself, an accusation that the Kremlin has denied. Some of Putin's activities have been criticised for being staged; outside of Russia, his macho image has been the subject of parody. Putin's height has been estimated by Kremlin insiders to be between 155 and 165 centimetres (5 feet 1 inch and 5 feet 5 inches) tall but is usually given at 170 centimetres (5 feet 7 inches).\nThere are many songs about Putin, and Putin's name and image are widely used in advertisement and product branding. Among the Putin-branded products are Putinka vodka, the PuTin brand of canned food, the Gorbusha Putina caviar, and a collection of T-shirts with his image.\n\n\n=== Public recognition in the West ===\nIn 2007, he was the Time Person of the Year. In 2015, he was No. 1 on the Time's Most Influential People List. Forbes ranked him the World's Most Powerful Individual every year from 2013 to 2016. He was ranked the second most powerful individual by Forbes in 2018.\nIn Germany, the word \"Putinversteher\" (female form \"Putinversteherin\") is a neologism and a political buzzword (Putin + verstehen), which literally translates \"Putin understander\", i.e., \"one who understands Putin\". It is a pejorative reference to politicians and pundits who express empathy to Putin and may also be translated as \"Putin-empathizer\".\n\n\n=== Putinisms ===\nPutin has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as putinisms. Many of them were first made during his annual Q&A conferences, where Putin answered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well as from Russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from studios and outdoor sites across Russia. Putin is known for his often tough and sharp language, often alluding to Russian jokes and folk sayings. Putin sometimes uses Russian criminal jargon (known as \"fenya\" in Russian), albeit not always correctly.\n\n\n== Assessments ==\n\nAssessments of Putin's character as a leader have evolved during his long presidency. His shifting of Russia towards autocracy and weakening of the system of representative government advocated by Boris Yeltsin has met with criticism. Russian dissidents and western leaders now frequently characterise him as a \"dictator\". Others have offered favourable assessments of his impact on Russia.\nOtto von Habsburg, the last crown prince of Austria-Hungary and former Member of the European Parliament, was an early critic of Putin. In a newspaper interview in 2002 and in two speeches in 2003 and 2005, he warned of Putin as an \"international threat\", that he was \"cruel and oppressive\", and a \"stone cold technocrat\".\nPutin was described in 2015 as a \"dictator\" by political opponent Garry Kasparov, and as the \"Tsar of corruption\" in 2016 by opposition activist and blogger Alexei Navalny. He was described as a \"bully\" and \"arrogant\" by former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton, and as \"self-centered\" by the Dalai Lama. In 2015, opposition politician Boris Nemtsov said that Putin was turning Russia into a \"raw materials colony\" of China.\nFormer U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger wrote in 2014 that the West has demonized Putin. Egon Krenz, former leader of East Germany, said the Cold War never ended, adding: \"After weak presidents like Gorbachev and Yeltsin, it is a great fortune for Russia that it has Putin\".\nMany Russians credit Putin for reviving Russia's fortunes. Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while acknowledging the flawed democratic procedures and restrictions on media freedom during the Putin presidency, said that Putin had pulled Russia out of chaos at the end of the Yeltsin years, and that Russians \"must remember that Putin saved Russia from the beginning of a collapse\". Chechen Republic head and Putin supporter, Ramzan Kadyrov, stated prior to 2011 that Putin saved both the Chechen people and Russia.\nRussia has suffered democratic backsliding during Putin's tenure. Freedom House has listed Russia as being \"not free\" since 2005. Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy, citing purges and jailing of political opponents, curtailed press freedom, and the lack of free and fair elections. In 2004, Freedom House warned that Russia's \"retreat from freedom marks a low point not registered since 1989, when the country was part of the Soviet Union\".\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Russia as \"authoritarian\" since 2011, whereas it had previously been considered a \"hybrid regime\" (with \"some form of democratic government\" in place). According to political scientist Larry Diamond, writing in 2015, \"no serious scholar would consider Russia today a democracy\".\nFollowing the jailing of the anti-corruption blogger and activist Alexei Navalny in 2018, Forbes wrote: \"Putin's actions are those of a dictator... As a leader with failing public support, he can only remain in power by using force and repression that gets worse by the day\". In November 2021, The Economist also noted that Putin had \"shifted from autocracy to dictatorship\".\nIn February 2015, former U.S. ambassador to Germany John Kornblum wrote in The Wall Street Journal that:\n\nWestern nations must start the turnaround by emphatically refuting one of Mr. Putin's favorite claims: that the West abrogated the promise of democratic partnership with Russia in the 1990 Paris Charter, a document produced by a summit that included European governments, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, convened as Communism crumbled across Eastern Europe... The U.S. and its allies didn't rush in after 1990 to exploit a proud but collapsing Soviet Union – a tale that Mr. Putin now spins. I took part in nearly every major negotiation of that era. Never was the idea of humbling Russia considered even for a moment. The Russian leaders we encountered were not angry Prussian-style Junkers who railed against a strategic stab in the back. Many if not all viewed the fall of the Soviet Union as liberation rather than defeat... Contrary to Mr. Putin's fictions about NATO's illegal enlargement, the West has honored the agreements worked out with Russia two decades ago.\nIn her 2017 book Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism, Kristen Ghodsee argued that the triumphalist attitudes of Western powers at the end of the Cold War, and the fixation with linking all leftist and socialist political ideals with the horrors of Stalinism, allowed neoliberalism to fill the void, undermined democratic institutions and reforms, left a trail of economic misery, unemployment, hopelessness and rising inequality throughout the former Eastern Bloc. This includes Russia, helping fuel the rise of Putin's extremist right-wing nationalism.\n\n\n=== After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine ===\n\nFollowing mounting civilian casualties during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, U.S. president Joe Biden called Putin a war criminal and \"murderous dictator\". In the 2022 State of the Union Address, Biden said that Putin had \"badly miscalculated\". The Ukrainian envoy to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya likened Putin to Adolf Hitler. Latvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins also likened the Russian leader to Hitler, saying he was \"a deluded autocrat creating misery for millions\" and that \"Putin is fighting against democracy (...) If he can attack Ukraine, theoretically it could be any other European country\".\nLithuania's foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said, \"The battle for Ukraine is a battle for Europe. If Putin is not stopped there, he will go further\". President Emmanuel Macron of France said Putin was \"deluding himself\". French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced him as \"a cynic and a dictator\". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Putin \"a lying, murderous dictator.\" UK prime minister Boris Johnson also labelled Putin a \"dictator\" who had authorised \"a tidal wave of violence against a fellow Slavic people\". Some authors, such as Michael Hirsh, described Putin as a \"messianic\" Russian nationalist and Eurasianist.\nIn March 2025, Franklin Foer of The Atlantic said that the 21st century was the \"Age of Vladimir Putin\". Foer wrote that:\n\nOver the past 25 years, the world has bent to the vision of one man. In the course of a generation, he not only short-circuited the transition to democracy in his own country, and in neighboring countries, but set in motion a chain of events that has shattered the transatlantic order that prevailed after World War II. In the global turn against democracy, he has played, at times, the role of figurehead, impish provocateur, and field marshal. We are living in the Age of Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\nVladimir Putin has been nominated and elected as President of Russia all five times since 2000, typically under an independent banner. In the most recent 2024 Russian presidential election, Putin achieved 88% of the popular vote. There were reports of irregularities at this election, including ballot stuffing and coercion. Russian authorities claimed that in occupied areas of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, Putin won 88.12% and 92.83% of votes. In Chechnya, Putin won 98.99% of the vote.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Family ===\n\nOn 28 July 1983, Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva, and they lived together in East Germany from 1985 to 1990. They have two daughters, Maria Putina, born on 28 April 1985 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and Yekaterina Putina, born on 31 August 1986 in Dresden, East Germany (now Germany).\nAn investigation by Proekt published in November 2020 alleged that Putin has another daughter, Elizaveta, also known as Luiza Rozova, (born in March 2003), with Svetlana Krivonogikh. Elizaveta studied in Paris under the name Elizaveta Olegovna Rudnova. In April 2008, the Moskovsky Korrespondent reported that Putin had divorced Lyudmila and was engaged to marry Olympic gold medalist Alina Kabaeva, a former rhythmic gymnast and Russian politician. The story was denied, and the newspaper was shut down shortly thereafter. Putin and Lyudmila continued to make public appearances together as spouses, while the status of his relationship with Kabaeva became a topic of speculation.\nOn 6 June 2013, Putin and Lyudmila announced that their marriage was over; on 1 April 2014, the Kremlin confirmed that the divorce had been finalised. Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to a daughter by Putin in 2015; this report was denied. Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to twin sons by Putin in 2019. However, in 2022, Swiss media, citing the couple's Swiss gynecologist, wrote that on both occasions Kabaeva gave birth to a boy.\nPutin has two grandsons, born in 2012 and 2017, through Maria. He reportedly also has a granddaughter, born in 2017, through Katerina. His cousin, Igor Putin, was a director at Moscow-based Master Bank and was accused in a number of money-laundering scandals.\n\n\n=== Wealth ===\n\nOfficial figures released during the legislative election of 2007 put Putin's wealth at approximately 3.7 million rubles (US$280,000) in bank accounts, a private 77.4-square-meter (833 sq ft) apartment in Saint Petersburg, and miscellaneous other assets. Putin's reported 2006 income totaled 2 million rubles (approximately $152,000). In 2012, Putin reported an income of 3.6 million rubles ($270,000). Putin has been photographed wearing a number of expensive wristwatches, collectively valued at $700,000, nearly six times his annual salary. Putin has been known on occasion to give watches valued at thousands of dollars as gifts, for example a watch identified as a Blancpain to a Siberian boy he met while on vacation in 2009, and another similar watch to a factory worker the same year.\n\nAccording to Russian opposition politicians and journalists, Putin secretly possesses a multi-billion-dollar fortune via successive ownership of stakes in a number of Russian companies. According to one editorial in The Washington Post, \"Putin might not technically own these 43 aircraft, but, as the sole political power in Russia, he can act like they're his\". An RIA Novosti journalist argued that \"[Western] intelligence agencies ... could not find anything\". These contradictory claims were analyzed by Polygraph.info, which looked at a number of reports by Western (Anders Åslund estimate of $100–160 billion) and Russian (Stanislav Belkovsky estimated of $40 billion) analysts, CIA (estimate of $40 billion in 2007) as well as counterarguments of Russian media. Polygraph concluded:\n\nThere is uncertainty on the precise sum of Putin's wealth, and the assessment by the Director of U.S. National Intelligence apparently is not yet complete. However, with the pile of evidence and documents in the Panama Papers and in the hands of independent investigators such as those cited by Dawisha, Polygraph.info finds that Danilov's claim that Western intelligence agencies have not been able to find evidence of Putin's wealth to be misleading\nIn April 2016, 11 million documents belonging to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca were leaked to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The name of Putin does not appear in any of the records, and Putin denied his involvement with the company. However, various media have reported on three of Putin's associates on the list. According to the Panama Papers leak, close trusted associates of Putin own offshore companies worth US$2 billion in total. Süddeutsche Zeitung regards the possibility of Putin's family profiting from this money as plausible.\nAccording to the paper, the US$2 billion had been \"secretly shuffled through banks and shadow companies linked to Putin's associates\", such as construction billionaires Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, and Bank Rossiya, previously identified by the U.S. State Department as being treated by Putin as his personal bank account, had been central in facilitating this. It concludes that \"Putin has shown he is willing to take aggressive steps to maintain secrecy and protect [such] communal assets\".\nA significant proportion of the money trail leads to Putin's best friend Sergei Roldugin. Although a musician, and in his own words, not a businessman, it appears he has accumulated assets valued at $100m, and possibly more. It has been suggested he was picked for the role because of his low profile. There have been speculations that Putin, in fact, owns the funds, and Roldugin just acted as a proxy. Garry Kasparov said that \"[Putin] controls enough money, probably more than any other individual in the history of human race\".\n\n\n=== Residences ===\n\n\n==== Official government residences ====\n\nAs president and prime minister, Putin has lived in numerous official residences throughout the country. These residences include: the Moscow Kremlin, Novo-Ogaryovo in Moscow Oblast, Gorki-9 near Moscow, Bocharov Ruchey in Sochi, Dolgiye Borody (residence) in Novgorod Oblast, and Riviera in Sochi. In August 2012, critics of Putin listed the ownership of 20 villas and palaces, nine of which were built during Putin's 12 years in power.\n\n\n==== Personal residences ====\nSoon after Putin returned from his KGB service in Dresden, East Germany, he built a dacha in Solovyovka on the eastern shore of Lake Komsomolskoye on the Karelian Isthmus in Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast, near St. Petersburg. After the dacha burned down in 1996, Putin built a new one identical to the original and was joined by a group of seven friends who built dachas nearby. In 1996, the group formally registered their fraternity as a co-operative society, calling it Ozero (\"Lake\") and turning it into a gated community.\nA massive Italianate-style mansion costing an alleged US$1 billion and dubbed \"Putin's Palace\" is under construction near the Black Sea village of Praskoveevka. In 2012, Sergei Kolesnikov, a former business associate of Putin's, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he had been ordered by Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin to oversee the building of the palace. He also said that the mansion, built on government land and sporting three helipads, plus a private road paid for from state funds and guarded by officials wearing uniforms of the official Kremlin guard service, have been built for Putin's private use.\nOn 19 January 2021, two days after Alexei Navalny was detained by Russian authorities upon his return to Russia, a video investigation by him and the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) was published accusing Putin of using fraudulently obtained funds to build the estate for himself in what he called \"the world's biggest bribe\". In the investigation, Navalny said that the estate is 39 times the size of Monaco and cost over 100 billion rubles ($1.35 billion) to construct. It also showed aerial footage of the estate via a drone and a detailed floorplan of the palace that Navalny said was given by a contractor, which he compared to photographs from inside the palace that were leaked onto the Internet in 2011. He also detailed an elaborate corruption scheme allegedly involving Putin's inner circle that allowed Putin to hide billions of dollars to build the estate. Since the prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin prefers to travel in an armored train to flying.\n\n\n=== Pets ===\n\nPutin has received five dogs from various national leaders: Konni, Buffy, Yume, Verni and Pasha. Konni died in 2014. When Putin first became president, the family had two poodles, Tosya and Rodeo. They reportedly stayed with his ex-wife Lyudmila after their divorce.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nPutin is Russian Orthodox. His mother was a devout Christian who attended the Russian Orthodox Church; his father was an atheist. Although his mother kept no icons at home, she attended church regularly, despite government persecution of her faith at that time. His mother secretly baptized him as a baby, and she regularly took him to services.\nAccording to Putin, his religious awakening began after a serious car crash involving his wife in 1993, and a life-threatening fire that burned down their dacha in August 1996. Shortly before an official visit to Israel, Putin's mother gave him his baptismal cross, telling him to get it blessed. Putin has stated, \"I did as she said and then put the cross around my neck. I have never taken it off since\".\nWhen asked in 2007 whether he believes in God, he replied, \"There are things I believe, which should not in my position, at least, be shared with the public at large for everybody's consumption because that would look like self-advertising or a political striptease\". Putin's rumoured confessor is Russian Orthodox bishop Tikhon Shevkunov. The sincerity of his Christianity has been rejected by his former advisor Sergei Pugachev.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nPutin watches football and supports FC Zenit Saint Petersburg. He also displays an interest in ice hockey and bandy, and played in a star-studded hockey game on his 63rd birthday.\nPutin has been practicing judo since he was 11, before switching to sambo at the age of fourteen. He won competitions in both sports in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). He was awarded eighth dan of the black belt in 2012, becoming the first Russian to achieve the status. He was rewarded an eighth-degree karate black belt in 2014.\nHe co-authored a book titled Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin in Russian (2000), and Judo: History, Theory, Practice in English (2004). Benjamin Wittes, a black belt in taekwondo and aikido and editor of Lawfare, has disputed Putin's martial arts skills, stating that there is no video evidence of Putin displaying any real noteworthy judo skills.\nIn March 2022, Putin was removed from all positions in the International Judo Federation (IJF) due to the Russian war in Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nIn July 2022, the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, stated they had no evidence to suggest Putin was unstable or in bad health. The statement was made because of increasing unconfirmed media speculation about Putin's health. Burns had previously been U.S. ambassador to Russia, and had personally observed Putin for over two decades, including a personal meeting in November 2021. A Kremlin spokesperson also dismissed rumours of Putin's bad health.\nThe Russian political magazine Sobesednik (Russian: Собеседник) alleged in 2018 that Putin had a sensory room installed in his private residence in the Novgorod Oblast. The White House, as well as Western generals, politicians, and political analysts, have questioned Putin's mental health after two years of isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2022, tabloid newspaper The Sun reported that based on video footage Putin may have Parkinson's disease. This speculation, which has not been supported by medical professionals, has spread in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which many saw as an irrational act. The Kremlin rejected the possibility of Parkinson's along with outside medical professionals, who stress that it is impossible to diagnose the condition based on video clips alone.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n\nAt least fifteen countries have awarded Vladimir Putin civilian honors since 2001. Putin has been awarded honorary doctorates and other awards from organizations across the world, but some of these were revoked in 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\nVladimir Putin and Russian Statecraft by Allen C.

        "title": "Katseye",
        "content": "Katseye (pronounced \"cat's eye\"; stylized in all caps) is a girl group based in Los Angeles, United States. The group is composed of six members: Daniela, Lara, Manon, Megan, Sophia, and Yoonchae. With members from the Philippines, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United States, Katseye is often described as a \"global girl group\".\nThe group was formed through the 2023 reality competition series Dream Academy, a collaboration between Hybe Corporation and Geffen Records. The group's formation process was later chronicled in the Netflix docuseries Popstar Academy: Katseye, which recounted the audition process, intensive training, and formation of the group. Katseye debuted in June 2024 with the single \"Debut\", followed by their breakthrough single, \"Touch\". They released their first extended play (EP), SIS (Soft Is Strong), later that year. In April 2025, they released \"Gnarly\" which, despite receiving mixed reactions on release, garnered significant attention and earned the group their first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second EP, Beautiful Chaos, released in June 2025, debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200, their highest-charting release to date.\nKatseye is noted for their fashion styling, with influences notably stemming from Y2K fashion. Their growing brand image has lead to multiple endorsements and campaigns tying into the style, including a campaign with the Fendi Baguette and Gap's low-rise denim. Humberto Leon acts as the group's creative director, taking inspiration from broad influences and utilizing the group's diverse backgrounds. In turn, Katseye have worked with companies spanning industries and nations, from the British soap company Lush, to the American clothing retailer Urban Outfitters, to the Philippine fast food chain Jollibee, tying back to the group's position as a \"global\" girl group.\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn an interview with InStyle, group member Sophia explained that the name Katseye is derived from the gemstone chrysoberyl, specifically the cymophane variety, which is commonly known as \"cat's eye\". She explained that the gemstone's distinctive optical effect, where light appears to shift and reflect differently when viewed from various angles, corresponds to the composition of the group's members' diverse personalities, talents, and backgrounds. The group was initially planned to be named \"Catseye,\" but during an interview with LA radio station KIIS-FM, it was revealed that Lara suggested altering the spelling to \"Katseye,\" which the members felt gave the name a more distinctive and stylized appearance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-debut activities and formation ===\n\nSeveral members of Katseye had experience in professional dance, television, and the entertainment industry before debuting with the group. Sophia, born to Filipino musical theatre actress Carla Guevara Laforteza, began singing at age three, and later made a television appearance on the game show Family Feud Philippines as a contestant in 2022. Atlanta-born Daniela began competitive dancesport at age three, and notably appeared on America's Got Talent season 8 in 2013, and became a Top 10 finalist on So You Think You Can Dance: The Next Generation in 2016. Born and raised in Honolulu, Megan was also trained in professional dance from a young age. Lara, under the stage name Lara Raj, began acting and singing at an early age, featuring in a campaign video for Michelle Obama's Global Girls Alliance, an initiative for the Obama Foundation in 2018. Swiss-born Manon gained popularity through short-form video content on TikTok and Instagram, where she posted fashion and lifestyle clips beginning in 2021. She also pursued modeling work in Switzerland. Yoonchae, the group's youngest and only South Korean member, joined Hybe in 2020 after passing the audition process, where she was a K-pop trainee before joining the lineup of Dream Academy.\n\nFormal preparations for the group began in November 2021, when Hybe and Geffen Records  launched a worldwide audition process for a girl group with \"contestants from around the world\", as part of the joint venture Hybe x Geffen Records. With auditions held across South Korea, the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom in 2022, the partnership aimed to create a group that would \"transcend national, cultural, and artistic boundaries\". In an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily, Hybe founder Bang Si-hyuk expressed his intentions to promote the resultant group to the American market. From more than 120,000 applicants, twenty contestants were selected to participate in the reality competition series The Debut: Dream Academy, which determined the final lineup through a series of performance-based missions. Prior to the series premiere, the contestants were trained for a year in Los Angeles, California, through methods prevalent in the Korean idol trainee system. Premiering on August 19, 2023, the competition concluded on November 18, with Sophia Laforteza, Lara Rajagopalan, Yoonchae Jeung, Megan Skiendiel, Daniela Avanzini, and Manon Bannerman selected as the six members of Katseye.\n\n\n=== 2024–present: SIS (Soft Is Strong) and Beautiful Chaos ===\n\nKatseye's formation and preparation for their debut EP were serialized in the documentary Pop Star Academy: Katseye, which premiered on August 21, 2024. Distributed by Netflix, the documentary was directed by Nadia Hallgren.\nIn June 2024, Hybe confirmed that the release of the group's first EP was set for August that year. For the EP, Katseye collaborated with several songwriters and producers, including Ryan Tedder and Omer Fedi. Two singles preceded its release. The first single, \"Debut\", was released on June 28, with a music video filmed in Medellín, Colombia, directed by Gregory Ohrel. The single is an upbeat pop track that explores themes of confidence and sisterhood in reference to the members' bond as a group. It was met with a lukewarm response commercially, with the music video for the single receiving 2.33 million views in three days, underperforming the viewership of music releases of Korean acts in a similar timeframe. The second single, \"Touch\", was released on July 26. The melodic drum and bass R&B track discusses the \"complexity of love\" and deviates from the sound of \"Debut\", emphasizing the members' vocals. The single ranked at number 22 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and entered the Billboard Philippines Hot 100 chart. \"Touch\" attained further success after its choreography went viral as a dance challenge on the video-sharing platform TikTok in September 2024.\n\nThe full EP, titled SIS (Soft Is Strong), was released on August 16. With five tracks, the EP debuted at number 119 on the Billboard 200 as Katseye landed atop the Emerging Artists chart. In support of the EP, the group embarked on an Asian tour, which began in South Korea on September 12. Megan would refrain from touring from September 21, owing to her back injury. On November 14, Katseye released \"Flame\", the theme song for the Netflix animated series Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld.\nOn March 7, 2025, Katseye was added to the lineup of Wango Tango 2025, scheduled for May 10. On March 19, they were added to the lineup of Lollapalooza in Chicago, scheduled for August 3.\nKatseye released a new single, \"Gnarly\", on April 30. \"Gnarly\" became the group's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was released as the first single from their second EP, Beautiful Chaos. On June 6, Katseye released a remix of \"Gnarly\" featuring rapper Ice Spice. On June 20, they released \"Gabriela\", the EP's second single. The track was accompanied by a music video styled as a telenovela and featured a cameo from actress Jessica Alba. Co-written by Charli XCX, \"Gabriela\" was described as a contemporary twist on Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\". On June 27, Beautiful Chaos was released, alongside a music video for the EP's third single, \"Gameboy\". The EP debuted in the fourth spot of the Billboard 200, their first entry in the top ten of the chart.\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\nIn September 2024, Katseye made their first New York Fashion Week attendance at the Spring Summer 2025 show for the American fashion company Coach, which in turn placed them in several promotional endorsements and content for the brand's released collection. Subsequently, Katseye were featured in Coach's collaboration campaign with the South Korean streetwear brand Matin Kim, which launched a line of ready-to-wear clothing exclusively for Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Interview Magazine's editor-in-chief  Mel Ottenberg describes Coach, known for its blend of both \"punkish and preppy\" styles through denim looks, as a perfect match for Katseye's own brand.\nIn April 2025, Katseye was featured in Fendi's Fendi For Yourself campaign, launched in celebration of the brand's 100th anniversary. The campaign highlighted two of Fendi's most popular handbags, the Baguette and the Peekaboo, both regarded as cultural symbols within the fashion industry. In May, Katseye partnered with Glossier to launch the brand's first lip oil product line titled 'Lip Glaze'. The collaboration featured six tinted oils, each shade corresponding to one of the group's members. In the same month, the group launched a collaboration with Urban Outfitters, where they performed live at the \"UO Haul\" event in New York on May 20 to showcase their single \"Gnarly\". Additionally, the group released an exclusive neon blue vinyl edition of their EP Beautiful Chaos, limited to 3,000 copies, for pre-order through Urban Outfitters. In June of 2025, Katseye partnered with jewelry brand Pandora to release various charms selected by each member to represent individual motifs. In the same month, Katseye partnered with Lush to release a bath bomb and six collectable soaps. In August, they also launched a merchandise collaboration with Philippine fast food chain Jollibee.\nIn August 2025, Katseye starred in Gap's Fall 2025 denim campaign, dancing to Kelis' \"Milkshake\" with original choreography by Robbie Blue. Achieving over 400 million views and 8 billion impressions across platforms in under 2 weeks, Gap CEO Richard Dickson described the campaign as a \"cultural takeover,\" highlighting its unprecedented reach and impact on the brand's own image. He noted that the ad garnered more views in its first three days than the brand's previous four releases combined. Additionally, the campaign received wide praise for its contrast to American Eagle's jeans campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, which released earlier in the year. While Sweeney's ad faced criticism for perceived eugenic undertones, Katseye's ad was lauded for its inclusive and empowering message. Observers noted the timing and messaging of Gap's campaign provided a refreshing alternative that emphasized unity and cultural celebration.\n\n\n== Public image ==\n\nKatseye is widely labeled as a \"global girl group\", blending stylistic traits of Western pop with the presentation attributed to K-pop. As Daniela described them in an interview with i-D, they are \"the first American girl group to make American pop music but trained to do the crazy choreography of K‑pop.\" The group includes the first Indian, Filipina, Latina, and Black artists to be signed under Hybe: Lara, Sophia, Daniela, and Manon, respectively. Before the group's debut, Teen Vogue named Katseye as one of twelve \"Girl Groups to Watch in 2024\".\nKatseye is noted for their distinctive fashion styling, often cited as a defining feature of the group alongside their music. With low-rise jeans, crop tops, and archival pieces, the group draws sartorial influence of late 1990s and early 2000s pop culture, often referred to as Y2K fashion. Katseye's long-term creative director, Humberto Leon, states drawing inspiration from art, film, and history rather than solely musical influences for the group. In particular, the style of celebrities prominent in the early 2000s, such as Devon Aoki for Megan, and Shakira for Daniela, served as key references for the image and appearance of the group's members. \"Without tokenizing them\", Leon cites the appreciation for the group's diverse backgrounds as a forerunner for their image, often incorporating items such as the bindi for Lara and waist beads for Manon. Members have highlighted the group's identity and openness to these influences, with Manon stating, ‘I have locs sometimes. Humberto is always like, 'Yeah, let’s do it.' He’s always asking if I have new ideas\".\nMusically, Katseye has cited The Pussycat Dolls, Spice Girls, and Le Sserafim as influences.\n\n\n== Members ==\nDaniela\nLara\nManon\nMegan\nSophia – leader\nYoonchae\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== As featured artist ====\n\n\n=== Soundtrack appearances ===\n\n\n=== Other charted songs ===\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== Other videos ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Reality shows ===\n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\n\n=== Tours ===\nThe Beautiful Chaos Tour (2025)\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\n\n=== TV performances ===\n\n\n=== Other events ===\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n\n\n=== Listicles ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.\nInitially available only in English, Wikipedia exists in over 340 languages and is the world's ninth most visited website. The English Wikipedia, with over 7 million articles, remains the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 65 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average)  as of April 2024. As of May 2025, over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic comes from the United States, while Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia each account for around 5%.\nWikipedia has been praised for enabling the democratization of knowledge, its extensive coverage, unique structure, and culture. Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site. Wikipedia's volunteer editors have written extensively on a wide variety of topics, but the encyclopedia has also been criticized for systemic bias, such as a gender bias against women and a geographical bias against the Global South. While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward. Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for up-to-date information about those events.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Nupedia ===\n\nVarious collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success. Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman. Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.\n\n\n=== Launch and rapid growth ===\nWikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 (referred to as Wikipedia Day) as a single English language edition with the domain name www.wikipedia.com, and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia. Its integral policy of \"neutral point of view\" arose within its first year. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia. Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.\n\nWikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004. Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made in China during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.\nCiting fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002. Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.\nAfter an early period of exponential growth, the growth rate of the English Wikipedia in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007. The edition reached 3 million articles in August 2009. Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to \"increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits\". Others suggested that the growth flattened naturally because articles that could be called \"low-hanging fruit\"—topics that clearly merit an article—had already been created and built up extensively.\n\nIn November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008. The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend. Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology. Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\". A 2013 MIT Technology Review article, \"The Decline of Wikipedia\", questioned this claim, reporting that since 2007 Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and suggesting that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae. In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline. In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated, \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.\" The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.\n\n\n=== Sister projects ===\n\nWikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002, Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews, for collaborative journalism, and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalog of all species, but is not open for public editing. In 2012, Wikivoyage, an editable travel guide, and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.\n\n\n=== Milestones ===\n\nIn January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the United States, according to Comscore Networks. With 42.9 million unique visitors, it was ranked ninth, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3 million unique visitors. In 2014, it received 8 billion page views every month. On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\". As of March 2023, it ranked sixth in popularity, according to Similarweb. Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through \"stigmergic accumulation\".\n\nOn January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours. More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.\nIn January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument; and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia. In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash. In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic DNA.\nOn January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost 9 percent.\" Varma added, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\" When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\" By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally. As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals, from which cloud computing was the most cited page.\nOn January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called \"Vector 2022\". It featured a redesigned menu bar, moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool. The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes.\n\n\n== Collaborative editing ==\n\n\n=== Restrictions ===\nDue to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article. On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees. A frequently vandalized article can be \"semi-protected\" or \"extended confirmed protected\", meaning that only \"autoconfirmed\" or \"extended confirmed\" editors can modify it. A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators can make changes. A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as \"perhaps the most important\" means at its disposal to \"regulate its market of ideas\". Wikipedia has delegated some functions to bots. Such algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling, though the automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active Wikipedia editors. Bots must be approved by the community before their tasks are implemented.\nIn certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains \"stable versions\" of articles which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012. Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published. However, restrictions on editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversify the editing community.\nArticles related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict are placed under extended-confirmed protection. Editors also can make only one revert per day across the entire field and can be banned from editing related articles. These restrictions were introduced in 2008. In January 2025, the Arbitration Committee introduced the \"balanced editing restriction\", which requires sanctioned users to devote only a third of their edits to articles related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict even when no misconduct rules have been violated.\n\n\n=== Review of changes ===\nAlthough changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision. On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page. Registered users may maintain a \"watchlist\" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes. \"New pages patrol\" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.\nIn 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored \"creative construction\" over \"creative destruction\".\n\n\n=== Vandalism ===\n\nAny change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam. Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.\n\nObvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes. However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair.\nIn the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. It remained uncorrected for four months. Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced. After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\". The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.\n\n\n=== Disputes and edit warring ===\n\nWikipedia editors often have disagreements regarding content, which can be discussed on article Talk pages. Disputes may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\". It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added, and criticized as creating a competitive and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles. Research has focused on, for example, impoliteness of disputes, the influence of rival editing camps, the conversational structure, and the shift in conflicts to a focus on sources.\nTaha Yasseri of the University of Oxford examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive work behavior at Wikipedia. He relied instead on \"mutually reverting edit pairs\", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, anarchism, and Muhammad. By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories. In 2020, researchers identified other measures of editor behaviors, beyond mutual reverts, to identify editing conflicts across Wikipedia.\nEditors also debate the deletion of articles on Wikipedia, with roughly 500,000 such debates since Wikipedia's inception. Once an article is nominated for deletion, the dispute is typically determined by initial votes (to keep or delete) and by reference to topic-specific notability policies.\n\n\n== Policies and content ==\n\nWikipedia is composed of 11 different namespaces, with its articles being present in mainspace. Other namespaces have a prefix before their page title and fulfill various purposes. For example, the project namespace uses the Wikipedia prefix and is used for self-governance related discussions. Most readers are not aware of these other namespaces.\nThe fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the \"Five pillars\", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. The five pillars are:\n\nWikipedia is an encyclopedia\nWikipedia is written from a neutral point of view\nWikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute\nWikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility\nWikipedia has no firm rules\nThe rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.\n\n\n=== Content policies and guidelines ===\n\nAccording to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style. A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of \"notability\", which generally means that the topic has been covered extensively in reliable sources that are independent of the article's subject. Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized and therefore must not present original research. Some subjects such as politicians and academics have specialized notability requirements. Finally, Wikipedia must reflect a neutral point of view. This is accomplished through summarizing reliable sources, using impartial language, and ensuring that multiple points of view are presented based on their prominence. Information must also be verifiable. Information without citations may be tagged or removed entirely. This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced. As Wikipedia policies changed over time, and became more complex, their number has grown. In 2008, there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages; by 2013, scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nWikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time. An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article. Editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. Some user rights are granted automatically, such as the autoconfirmed and extended confirmed groups, when thresholds for account age and edits are met.\n\n\n=== Administrators ===\n\nExperienced editors can choose to run for \"adminship\", which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes. Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.\nBy 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous. In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.\n\n\n=== Dispute resolution ===\nOver time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\", in which bots add the discussion to a centralized list of discussions, invite editors to participate, and remove the discussion from the list after 30 days. However, editors have the discretion to close (and delist) the discussion early or late. If the result of a discussion is not obvious, a closer—an uninvolved editor usually in good standing—may render a verdict from the strength of the arguments presented and then the numbers of arguers on each side. Wikipedians emphasize that the process is not a vote by referring to statements of opinion in such discussions as \"!vote\"s, in which the exclamation mark is the symbol for logical negation and pronounced \"not\".\nWikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field. Joseph Reagle and Sue Gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by Quakers. A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.\n\n\n==== Arbitration Committee ====\n\nThe Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.\nStatistical analyses suggest that the English Wikipedia committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and antisocial behavior. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.\n\n\n== Community ==\n\nEach article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated \"talk\" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike, although not always with entirely negative connotations. Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as \"anti-elitism\".\n\nWikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked there. Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\". Since Wikipedia relies on volunteer labour, editors frequently focus on topics that interest them.\n\nThe English Wikipedia has 7,050,965 articles, 49,628,836 registered editors, and 109,439 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days. Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\". Editors who do not log in are in some sense \"second-class citizens\" on Wikipedia, as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\", but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty. New editors often struggle to understand Wikipedia's complexity. Experienced editors are encouraged to not \"bite\" the newcomers in order to create a more welcoming atmosphere.\n\n\n=== Research ===\nA 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\". Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\" However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\".\nIn 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that \"one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\" This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts. A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others, although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small. According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\".\n\n\n=== Diversity ===\nSeveral studies have shown that most volunteer Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female. Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology. Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\". Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.\n\n\n== Language editions ==\n\nThere are currently 343 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias). As of September 2025, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, German, French, Swedish, and Dutch Wikipedias. The second and fifth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013 had created about half the articles on the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.\n\nIn addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (Russian, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Egyptian Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Arabic, Waray, and Portuguese), seven more have over 500,000 articles (Persian, Catalan, Indonesian, Korean, Serbian, Norwegian, and Turkish), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000. The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 7 million articles. As of January 2021, the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.\n\nSince Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color) or points of view.\nThough the various language editions are held to global policies such as \"neutral point of view\", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.\nJimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as \"an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language\". Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others). For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\n\nTranslated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.\nA study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the Simple English Wikipedia.\n\n\n=== English Wikipedia editor numbers ===\nOn March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that \"the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\" The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.\nIn contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nVarious Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014. Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\". Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's \"undue-weight policy\", concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.\nJournalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an \"ax to grind\" on the topic. A 2008 article in Education Next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin. In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that \"Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.\"\nMultiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being ideologically biased. In February 2021, Fox News accused Wikipedia of whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much \"leftist bias\". Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a \"propaganda\" for the left-leaning \"establishment\" and warned the site can no longer be trusted. In 2022, libertarian John Stossel opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics. Some studies suggest that Wikipedia (and in particular the English Wikipedia) has a \"western cultural bias\" (or \"pro-western bias\") or \"Eurocentric bias\", reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, \"similar biases that are found in the 'ivory tower' of academic historiography\". Carwil Bjork-James proposes that Wikipedia could follow the diversification pattern of contemporary scholarship and Dangzhi Zhao calls for a \"decolonization\" of Wikipedia to reduce bias from opinionated White male editors.\n\n\n=== Accuracy of content ===\n\nArticles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.\" Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\" in science articles, \"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\"\nOthers raised similar critiques. The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica, and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica. In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a \"flawed study design\" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study \"statistical power\" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 × 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).\nAs a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \"makes no guarantee of validity\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it. Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, the insertion of false information, vandalism, and similar problems. Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\".\nEconomist Tyler Cowen wrote: \"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. Amy Bruckman has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, \"the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created\". In September 2022, The Sydney Morning Herald journalist Liam Mannix noted that: \"There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate ... And yet it [is].\" Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable as Encyclopædia Britannica, summarizing that \"...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty.\"\nCritics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable. Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear. Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.\n\nWikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.\nIn response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing. The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'\" These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.\n\n\n=== Discouragement in education ===\nSome university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources; some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative. Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia\", he said.\nIn February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change. In June 2007, Michael Gorman, former president of the American Library Association, condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\".\nA 2020 research study published in Studies in Higher Education argued that Wikipedia could be applied in the higher education \"flipped classroom\", an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities. The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.\n\n\n==== Medical information ====\n\nOn March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled \"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\", stated that \"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\" Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process. In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled \"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\" Beck added that: \"Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\"\n\n\n=== Coverage of topics and systemic bias ===\n\nWikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism). Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The \"Wikipedia is not censored\" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China and Pakistan, among other countries.\nThrough its \"Wikipedia Loves Libraries\" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles. A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the \"people and arts\" category, while males focus more on \"geography and science\". An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.\n\n\n==== Systemic biases ====\nWikipedia's policies may limit \"its capacity for truly representing global knowledge\". For example, Wikipedia only considers published sources to be reliable. Oral knowledge of Indigenous cultures is not always reflected in print. Marginalized topics are also more likely to lack significant coverage in reliable sources. Wikipedia's content is therefore limited as a result of larger systemic biases.\nAcademic studies of Wikipedia have shown that the average contributor to the English Wikipedia is an educated, technically inclined white male, aged 15–49, from a developed, predominantly Christian country. The corresponding point of view (POV) is over-represented. This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on Wikipedia. There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).\nInterdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view. In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\". The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.\nResearch conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, with Africa being the most underrepresented. Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.\n\n\n=== Explicit content ===\n\nWikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content. Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children. The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.\nThe Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers.\nIn April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law. Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted \"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\", under the PROTECT Act of 2003. That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law. Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.\nWikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, saying that Wikipedia did not have \"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\" Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\". Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.\n\n\n=== Privacy ===\nOne privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia regards one's right to remain a private citizen rather than a public figure in the eyes of the law. It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life. The Wikimedia Foundation's privacy policy states, \"we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement\", and states that \"personal information\" may be shared \"For legal reasons\", \"To Protect You, Ourselves & Others\", or \"To Understand & Experiment\".\nIn January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka \"Tron\", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.\nWikipedia has a \"Volunteer Response Team\" that uses Znuny, a free and open-source software fork of OTRS to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.\nIn late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the UK's Online Safety Bill legislation. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers.\n\n\n=== Sexism ===\n\nWikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment. The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship. Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.\nIn May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about Donna Strickland due to lack of coverage in the media. Five months later, Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics \"for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics\", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award. Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award Gérard Mourou. Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for Quartz argued that \"it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation.\" Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.\nA comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear of Stony Brook University's College of Business and Benjamin Collier of Carnegie Mellon University found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. \"Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.\"\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\n\n=== Wikimedia Foundation and affiliate movements ===\n\nWikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks. The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission. The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue Service Form 990 shows revenue of $124.6 million and expenses of almost $112.2 million, with assets of about $191.2 million and liabilities of almost $11 million.\nIn May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner. The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background, from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \"Information, like air, wants to be free.\" The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \"said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities\", Walsh said.\nFollowing the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \"superprotection\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016. Maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to Bloomberg Businessweek regarding the harassment issue that: \"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words.\"\nMaher served as executive director until April 2021. Maryana Iskander was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community.\nWikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimedia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.\n\n\n=== Software operations and support ===\n\nThe operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system. The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software. In April 2005, a Lucene extension was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on Elasticsearch. In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use. It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \"slow and buggy\". The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.\n\n\n=== Automated editing ===\n\nComputer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson, created articles with his bot Lsjbot, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses). Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly. Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government. Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation. According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.\n\n\n=== Hardware operations and support ===\n\nAs of 2021, page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by Apache Traffic Server. Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.\nWikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers running the Debian operating system. By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia. In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia. In 2022, a caching data center was opened in Marseille, France. In 2024, a caching data center was opened in São Paulo, the first of its kind in South America. As of November 2024, caching clusters are located in Amsterdam, San Francisco, Singapore, Marseille, and São Paulo.\n\n\n=== Internal research and operational development ===\nFollowing growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits, the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation. Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the \"Thank\" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition. The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment. At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually. In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.\n\n\n=== Internal news publications ===\n\nMultiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications. Wikimedia's online newspaper The Signpost was founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008. The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wikipedia's sister projects.\n\n\n=== The Wikipedia Library ===\n\nWikipedia editors sometimes struggle to access paywalled sources needed to improve a subject. The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications, so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia. Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when ICE Publishing joined in 2020, a spokesman said \"By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources – creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.\"\n\n\n== Access to content ==\n\n\n=== Content licensing ===\nWhen the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work. The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009. In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.\nThe handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text. The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France.\n\n\n=== Methods of access ===\nBecause Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.\nThousands of \"mirror sites\" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are Reference.com and Answers.com. Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did. Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Microsoft Bing (via technology gained from Powerset) and DuckDuckGo.\nCollections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles. The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles, the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles, and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles. Additionally, \"Wikipedia for Schools\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia and SOS Children, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.\nThere have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form. Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM.\nThe website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format, RDF. As of February 2023, it has over 101 million items. WikiReader is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by OpenMoko and first released in 2009.\nObtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged. Wikipedia publishes \"dumps\" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023, there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images. Wikimedia Enterprise is a for-profit solution to this.\nSeveral languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.\n\n\n==== Mobile access ====\n\nWikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\" In 2014 The New York Times reported that Möller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment. By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700 employees.\nAccess to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or WebOS-based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation.\nThe Android app for Wikipedia was released in January 2012, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access. It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.\nAndrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years, and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo. Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.\n\n\n=== Chinese access ===\nAccess to Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China since May 2015. This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult.\n\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n\n\n=== Trusted source to combat fake news ===\nIn 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news. Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.\"\n\n\n=== Readership ===\nIn February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\" However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping. The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.\nIn addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles, Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001. The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009. The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. In 2011, Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.\nAccording to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization. As of February 2023, Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion pageviews each month.\n\n\n==== COVID-19 pandemic ====\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall. Noam Cohen wrote in Wired that Wikipedia's effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, \"Unless Twitter, Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet.\" In October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects. There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November 2021.\n\n\n=== Cultural significance ===\n\nWikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases. The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for the Civil Marriage Act. The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case. Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports. In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia. Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.\nIn 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide. On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: \"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\" An October 2007 Reuters article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.\nOne of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.\n\nA working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia \"the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth\".\nIn a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web\" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \"sapere aude\" (lit. 'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of \"dare not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\"\n\n\n==== Awards ====\n\nWikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004. The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the \"community\" category.\nIn 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in response to the question \"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\"\nIn September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger.\nIn 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences, and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation. Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian Wikipedia users.\n\n\n==== Satire ====\n\nComedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on\". Another example can be found in \"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion, as well as the 2010 The Onion article \"'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\".\nIn an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy The Office, office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.\n\"My Number One Doctor\", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.\nIn 2008, the comedy website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named \"Professor Wikipedia\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\" In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.\nOn August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\" The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman.\nIn June 2024, nature.com published a fictional Wikipedia Talk page under the title \"Plastic-eating fungus caused doomsday\" by Emma Burnett. The Talk page concerned a fictional article describing the unintended consequences of the release of a plastic-eating fungus to clean up an oil spill. The article contained Talk page topics found on Wikipedia, like discussions of changes in the articles priority level.\n\n\n=== Publishing ===\n\nThe most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. Nicholas Carr's 2005 essay \"The amorality of Web 2.0\" criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote, \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\" Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired, wrote in Nature that the \"wisdom of crowds\" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes.\nWikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping \"far more sharply\". Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two biographies wrote, \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\"\n\n\n=== Research use ===\nWikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called \"wikification\", and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation. Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia.\nIn 2015, French researchers José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations. They used PageRank, CheiRank and similar algorithms \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)\". The study was updated in 2019.\nIn December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \"at least a dozen times a day\", and had \"never caught it out\". He described it as \"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.\nA 2017 MIT study suggests that words used in Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications. Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism and data quality assessment in Wikipedia.\nIn February 2022, civil servants from the UK's Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee were found to have used Wikipedia for research after journalists at The Independent noted that parts of the document had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on Constantinople and the list of largest cities throughout history.\n\n\n== Related projects ==\nSeveral interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.\nSeveral free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2), with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE). One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\nSubsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Wikipedia-affiliated and primary sources ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nMcDowell, Zachary; Vetter, Matthew (2022).

        "title": "Lindsay Lohan",
        "content": "Lindsay Dee Lohan ( LOH-ən; born July 2, 1986) is an American actress and singer. Her career has been characterized by success as a child actress in the 1990s and early 2000s, brief mainstream Hollywood recognition in the mid-2000s, personal and legal issues in the late 2000s and early 2010s, and a resurgence in the late 2010s. Lohan's accolades include three MTV Movie & TV Awards, in addition to nominations for three Critics' Choice Movie Awards, a Saturn Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She appeared on Forbes' annual Celebrity 100 list from 2004 to 2005.\nLohan was signed to Ford Models at the age of three, and gained early recognition as a child actress on the soap operas Guiding Light (1993) and Another World (1996–1997). Her breakthrough role came with the dual role of reunited identical twins in the Disney comedy The Parent Trap (1998); its success led to subsequent Disney projects including Life-Size (2000), Get a Clue (2002), Freaky Friday (2003) and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004). Her portrayal of Cady Heron in the teen comedy Mean Girls (2004) affirmed her status as a teen idol and established her as a prominent leading lady; The New Yorker later ranked it as the eleventh-best film performance of the 21st century.\nLohan signed with Casablanca Records and released two studio albums, the platinum-certified Speak (2004) and gold-certified A Little More Personal (Raw) (2005). Her acting career continued with the comedies Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005) and Just My Luck (2006), followed by the independent films A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby (both 2006) and Chapter 27 (2007). Her behavior during the filming of the 2006 dramedy Georgia Rule marked the start of personal struggles that plagued her life and career for nearly a decade, making her a fixture in the tabloid press due to legal issues and rehabilitation stints. In an attempt to return to acting, she appeared in Machete (2010), Liz & Dick (2012) and The Canyons (2013). Guided by Oprah Winfrey, Lohan was the subject of the docu-series Lindsay (2014), later made her stage debut in the London West End production of Speed-the-Plow (2014), and starred in the comedy series Sick Note (2018). Lohan signed a multi-picture deal with Netflix, starring in the romantic comedies Falling for Christmas (2022), Irish Wish (2024), and Our Little Secret (2024). She reprised her Freaky Friday role in its sequel, Freakier Friday (2025)\nOutside entertainment, Lohan launched a clothing line, 6126, which was founded in 2008. People has named her among the most beautiful women in the world four times, most recently in 2024. In 2007, Maxim ranked her number one on their annual ranking of the world's most desirable women. Lohan is married and has one son.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLindsay Dee Lohan was born on July 2, 1986, in the Bronx, one of the five boroughs of New York City, and grew up in Merrick and Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island, New York. She is the eldest child of Dina (née Sullivan) and Michael Lohan. Her father, a former Wall Street trader, has been in trouble with the law on several occasions. Her mother is a former singer and dancer. Lohan has three younger siblings, all of whom have been models or actors: Michael Jr., who appeared with Lohan in The Parent Trap in 1998, Aliana, known as \"Ali\", and Dakota \"Cody\" Lohan. Lohan is of Irish and Italian heritage, and she was raised  Catholic. Her maternal antecedents were \"well known Irish Catholic stalwarts\" and her great-grandfather, John L. Sullivan, was a co-founder of the Pro-life Party on Long Island. She began home-schooling in grade 11. Lohan's parents married in 1985, separated when Lindsay was three, and later reunited. They separated again in 2005 and finalized their divorce in 2007.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1989–2002: Early career and breakthrough ===\nLohan began her career as a child model with Ford Models at the age of three. She modeled for Calvin Klein Kids and Abercrombie, and appeared in over 60 television commercials for brands like Pizza Hut and Wendy's, as well as a Jell-O spot with Bill Cosby. By the age of 10, when Lohan played Alexandra \"Alli\" Fowler in the television soap opera Another World, Soap Opera Magazine said she was already considered a show-business veteran.\nLohan remained in her role on Another World for a year, before leaving to star in Disney's 1998 family comedy The Parent Trap, a remake of the 1961 movie. She played the dual roles of twins, separated in infancy, who try to reunite their long-divorced parents, played by Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson. The film earned $92 million worldwide and received largely positive reviews. Lohan received unanimous acclaim for her debut performance. Critic Kenneth Turan called Lohan \"the soul of this film as much as Hayley Mills was of the original\", going on to say that \"she is more adept than her predecessor at creating two distinct personalities.\" The film won Lohan a Young Artist Award for best performance in a feature film as well as a three-film contract with Disney.\nAt the age of 14, Lohan played Bette Midler's daughter in the pilot episode of the short-lived series Bette, but she resigned her role when the production moved from New York to Los Angeles. Lohan starred in two made-for-TV movies: Life-Size alongside Tyra Banks in 2000, and Get a Clue in 2002.  Emilio Estefan and his wife, Gloria Estefan, signed Lohan to a five-album production deal in September 2002.\n\n\n=== 2003–2005: Rise to prominence ===\nIn 2003, Lohan starred alongside Jamie Lee Curtis in the remake of Disney's family comedy Freaky Friday, playing a mother and daughter who switch bodies and have to take on each other's roles. At Lohan's initiative, her character was rewritten and changed from a Goth style to be more mainstream. Her performance was met with significant praise. Critic Roger Ebert wrote that Lohan \"has that Jodie Foster sort of seriousness and intent focus beneath her teenage persona.\" Freaky Friday earned Lohan the award for Breakthrough Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards and, as of 2015, it remained her most commercially successful film, earning $160 million worldwide as well as an 87 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Her role required her to learn how to play the guitar and to sing. She recorded a song for the film, \"Ultimate\", which was released to Radio Disney to help promote the film. The song peaked at number 18 on Radio Disney's Top 30.\nIn 2004, Lohan had lead roles in two major motion pictures. The first film, Disney's teen comedy Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, earned a domestic box office total of $29 million, with Brandon Gray of Box Office Mojo commenting that it was \"well above expectations as it was strictly for young girls.\" But the film was not met with critical acclaim. Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \"though still a promising star, Lohan will have to do a little penance before she's forgiven for Confessions.\" Her second lead role that year, in the teen comedy Mean Girls, marked Lohan's first movie independent of Disney. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $129 million worldwide and, according to Brandon Gray, \"cementing her status as the new teen movie queen.\" Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that \"Lohan is sensitive and appealing, a solid locus for audience sympathy.\" David Rooney from Variety said that \"Lohan displays plenty of charm, verve and deft comic timing.\" Lohan received four awards at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards for Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, including Breakout Movie Star. Mean Girls also earned her two awards at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. In 2021, The New Yorker critic Richard Brody placed Lohan's performance in Mean Girls at number eleven in his list of \"The Best Movie Performances of the Century So Far\".\nWith Mean Girls, Lohan's public profile was raised significantly. Vanity Fair described how she became a household name. Paparazzi began following her, and her love life and partying became frequent targets of gossip sites and the tabloid media. Following the film, which was scripted by former Saturday Night Live writer-actress Tina Fey and featured several Saturday Night Live performers, Lohan hosted the show three times between 2004 and 2006. In 2004, when Lohan was 17, she became the youngest host of the MTV Movie Awards.\nLohan's debut album, Speak, was released in the United States on December 7, 2004. The album was the first high-seller from Casablanca Records in several years, selling 1 million units in the United States. The album received mostly negative reviews, with critics commenting that Lohan \"isn't a bad singer, but not an extraordinary singer either.\" In the United States, the album peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, selling 261,762 copies in its first week. In Germany the album debuted at number 53 and took four weeks to complete its chart run. The first two singles from Speak, \"Rumors\" and \"Over\", were both successes, with \"Over\" topping the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, where it stayed for three weeks. The song also did well internationally in countries such as Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. \"Rumors\" peaked at number six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and also did well in Australia and Germany, where it reached number 14. The music video for \"Rumors\" was nominated for Best Pop Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Both songs received heavy airplay on MTV's Total Request Live.\n\nLohan returned to Disney in 2005, starring in the comedy Herbie: Fully Loaded, the fifth film in the series with the anthropomorphic Volkswagen Beetle Herbie; she played a college graduate who finds Herbie, the living car, at a junk yard. The film earned $144 million worldwide, but it received mixed reviews. Stephen Holden of The New York Times called Lohan \"a genuine star who ... seems completely at home on the screen\", while James Berardinelli wrote that \"as bright a starlet as she may be, Lohan ends up playing second fiddle to the car.\" In 2005, Lohan became the first person to have a My Scene celebrity doll released by Mattel. She also voiced herself in the animated direct-to-DVD film My Scene Goes Hollywood: The Movie, based on the series of dolls.\nLohan's second album, A Little More Personal (Raw), was released in December 2005. It peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was eventually certified Gold. Lohan co-wrote most of the songs on the album, which received a mixed critical response. Slant Magazine called it \"contrived ... for all the so-called weighty subject matter, there's not much meat on these bones.\" Lohan herself directed the music video for the album's only single, \"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)\", which features her sister Aliana Lohan. The video is a dramatization of the pain Lohan said her family suffered at the hands of her father. It was her first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 57.\n\n\n=== 2006–2013: Career setbacks and limited work ===\nLohan's next widely released film, the romantic comedy Just My Luck, opened in May 2006 and, according to Variety, earned her over $7 million. The opening weekend box office takings of $5.7 million \"broke lead actress Lindsay Lohan's winning streak\" according to Brandon Gray. The film received poor reviews and earned Lohan her first Golden Raspberry nomination for Worst Actress. Following Just My Luck, Lohan focused on smaller roles in more mature, independent movies. Robert Altman's ensemble comedy A Prairie Home Companion, based on humorist Garrison Keillor's works, in which Lohan co-stars with Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, had a limited release in June 2006. Peter Travers wrote for Rolling Stone that \"Lohan rises to the occasion, delivering a rock-the-house version of 'Frankie and Johnny.'\" Co-star Streep said of Lohan's acting: \"She's in command of the art form\" and \"completely, visibly living in front of the camera.\" The Emilio Estevez ensemble drama Bobby, about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination, was released in theaters in November 2006. Lohan, who appeared as the character Diane, received favorable comments for her performance, particularly a scene alongside Sharon Stone. As part of the Bobby ensemble cast, Lohan was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nLohan's next appearance was in Chapter 27 as a John Lennon fan who befriends Mark David Chapman, played by Jared Leto, on the day he murders Lennon. Filming finished in early 2006, but the film was not released until March 2008 due to difficulties in finding a distributor. In May 2007, the drama Georgia Rule was released. In the film, Lohan portrays an out-of-control teenager whose mother (Felicity Huffman) brings her to the house of her own estranged mother (Jane Fonda). Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"Lohan hits a true note of spiteful princess narcissism.\" During filming in 2006, Lohan was hospitalized, her representative saying \"she was overheated and dehydrated.\" In a letter that was made public, studio executive James G. Robinson called Lohan \"irresponsible and unprofessional.\" He mentioned \"various late arrivals and absences from the set\" and said that \"we are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called 'exhaustion.'\" In 2007, Lohan was cast in the film Poor Things, however she would ultimately lose the role when she later entered rehab.\nIn January 2007, production on the film I Know Who Killed Me was put on hold when Lohan underwent appendix surgery. While Lohan was in rehab, she continued shooting the film, returning to the facility at night. Shortly thereafter, Lohan withdrew from a film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance, her publicist stating that Lohan needed to \"focus on getting better.\" Lohan was replaced in The Edge of Love in April 2007, shortly before filming was to begin, with the director citing \"insurance reasons\" and Lohan later explaining that she \"was going through a really bad time then.\" Lohan withdrew from a scheduled appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in which she had been due to promote I Know Who Killed Me, a psychological horror-thriller in which she stars as a stripper with a dual personality. The film premiered in July 2007 to what Entertainment Weekly called \"an abysmal $3.5 million.\" It earned Lohan dual Golden Raspberry awards for Worst Actress, with Lohan coming first and second, tying with herself. Hollywood executives and industry insiders commented that it would be difficult for Lohan to find employment until she could prove that she was sober and reliable, citing possible issues with securing insurance.\nIn May 2008, Lohan's single \"Bossy\" was released onto digital outlets, and reached number one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. That month, she made her first screen appearance since I Know Who Killed Me, on ABC's television series Ugly Betty. She guest starred in four episodes as Kimmie Keegan, an old schoolmate of the protagonist Betty Suarez. In the comedy Labor Pains, Lohan plays a woman who pretends to be pregnant. During the shoot, Lohan's manager worked with the paparazzi to encourage the media to show her work, as opposed to partying. It was originally planned for a theatrical release, but instead appeared as a TV movie on the ABC Family cable channel in July 2009, another \"setback for the star\" according to Variety. The premiere received 2.1 million viewers, \"better-than-average\" for the channel according to E! Online. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times wrote that \"this is not a triumphant return of a prodigal child star. ... [Labor Pains] never shakes free of the heavy baggage Ms. Lohan brings to the role.\" Lohan was a guest judge on US TV style contest Project Runway sixth-season premiere episode, which aired in August 2009.\n\nLohan narrated and presented the British television documentary Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, about human trafficking in India. It was filmed during a week in India in December 2009, and transmitted on BBC Three in April 2010. The BBC was criticized for having hired Lohan, and while reviewers called the documentary compelling, they also found Lohan's presence to be odd and distracting. Lohan said: \"I hope my presence in India will bring awareness to the really important issues raised in making this film.\" In April 2010, Lohan was let go from the film The Other Side where she had been set to star, with the director saying she was \"not bankable.\"\nIn June 2010, Lohan was the subject of a fashion shoot in the photographer docu-series Double Exposure on Bravo. Robert Rodriguez's action exploitation film Machete opened in September 2010. In the film, Lohan's character takes drugs, is naked in much of her appearance, and later dons a nun's habit while toting a machine gun. Its critical reviews were mixed. The Washington Post described her character as \"a campier, trampier version of herself – or at least her tabloid image.\" Premiere.com said she was \"terrible\" while Variety called it \"her best work in some time.\" Because of her rehabilitation and legal engagements, Lohan did not participate in promotion of the movie. Lohan filmed a sketch where she is dressed as Marilyn Monroe for Inappropriate Comedy in 2010. The film had issues finding a distributor and was not released until 2013, when it was met with poor box office and critical reception. Lohan appeared on the October 2010 cover of Vanity Fair. She told the magazine: \"I want my career back\" and \"I know that I'm a damn good actress.\"\nLohan had not appeared on Saturday Night Live since 2006 until she hosted the show for the fourth time in March 2012. Her appearance received mixed to negative reviews. Critics appreciated the self-deprecating references to her personal troubles, but also commented that she largely played a supporting role. The episode had the second highest ratings of the season with 7.4 million viewers. In May 2012, Lohan appeared briefly, as a celebrity judge, on the television series Glee, in the episode \"Nationals\". Lohan stars as a surfer in the art film First Point by artist Richard Phillips. It debuted at Art Basel in June 2012 and features a score by Thomas Bangalter from Daft Punk. Comments from critics on Lohan's work were mixed.\nLohan starred as Elizabeth Taylor in the biographical made-for-TV movie Liz & Dick, which premiered on the Lifetime cable channel in November 2012. Reviews of Lohan's performance were largely, but not unanimously, negative. The Hollywood Reporter said she was \"woeful\" while Variety called her \"adequate.\" Entertainment Weekly described the premiere ratings of 3.5 millions as \"a little soft.\" During the production, paramedics were called to Lohan's hotel room, treating her for exhaustion and dehydration. In April 2013, the horror comedy Scary Movie 5 was released, where Lohan appears as herself alongside Charlie Sheen in the opening sketch. While the movie itself was panned by critics, a few reviewers found Lohan's and Sheen's to be one of the better scenes. Lohan also guest-starred as herself in an April 2013 episode of Sheen's comedy series Anger Management.\nIn August 2013, The Canyons was released, an independent erotic thriller directed by Paul Schrader and written by Bret Easton Ellis. It was made on a low budget, most of which was gathered through online fund raiser Kickstarter. Lohan received $100 a day and a share of the profits, and she was also credited as a co-producer. The New York Times Magazine described Lohan as difficult to work with, and the shoot as fraught with conflict between Lohan and Schrader. Lohan and her co-star, adult-film actor James Deen, portray an actress and a producer in a volatile relationship. Reviews for the film were generally poor, but several critics praised Lohan's performance. The New Yorker said she was \"overwrought and unfocused\" while Variety called her \"very affecting\" and Salon described her as \"almost incandescent.\" The same month Lohan filled in for Chelsea Handler as host of the cable talk show Chelsea Lately. She received mostly positive reviews for her appearance and the show garnered its best ratings of the year.\n\n\n=== 2014–2020: Focus on television and career expansion ===\n\nThe 8-part docu-series Lindsay was transmitted in March and April 2014 on Oprah Winfrey's OWN cable network. The series followed Lohan's life and work as she moved to New York City after leaving rehab. In the final episode, Lohan said that she had had a miscarriage which had interrupted filming of the series. The premiere had 693,000 viewers, described as \"so-so\" by The Hollywood Reporter. The ratings then slipped and the finale only had 406,000 viewers. New York Daily News called the series \"surprisingly routine\", Variety described it as boring, while Liz Smith said it was \"compelling\" and \"usually painful to watch.\" In December 2013, Lohan introduced Miley Cyrus before her set at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. In April 2014, Lohan guest-starred in an episode of the CBS sitcom 2 Broke Girls. Around this time, Lohan had also announced and began promoting a film she was set to star in titled Inconceivable, which was never produced for unknown reasons.\nLohan made her stage debut in October 2014, starring in the London West End production of David Mamet's Speed-the-Plow, a satire about the movie business. She portrayed Karen, the secretary of a Hollywood executive, in a role originally played by Madonna. Reviews of Lohan's performance were mixed, with the Associated Press describing critical reception overall as \"lukewarm.\" The Stage said she was \"out of her league\" while The Times wrote that she \"can act a bit\" and The Guardian said she \"holds the stage with ease.\"\nIn 2015, English band Duran Duran announced that Lohan was featured on the song \"Danceophobia\" from their fourteenth studio album, Paper Gods. That year, she filmed an independent supernatural thriller, Among the Shadows, in Belgium. The project saw a series of delays with its release and was eventually listed for sale at the European Film Market at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2018. It was released on March 5, 2019, by Momentum Pictures. In July 2018, the second season of Sick Note —in which Lohan had a recurring role— premiered on Sky One. Lohan  signed on to star in an MTV reality series, Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club (2019) focusing on her business ventures in Greece, which aired on MTV for one season. In July 2019, it was announced that Lohan would be one of the panelists on the Australian edition of Masked Singer. The reality singing competition series premiered in September 2019, and concluded in October that year. On July 7, 2020, it was revealed that Lohan would be unable to return to the judging panel for the second season, as she could not travel from Dubai to Melbourne due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of travel restrictions.\nIn June 2019, Lohan re-signed with Casablanca Records, a subsidiary of Republic Records, to release new music. On April 1, 2020, Lohan announced she would be releasing \"Back to Me\", her first single in twelve years. The song was released on April 3 and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n=== 2021–present: Return to film and resurgence ===\nIn May 2021, Netflix announced that Lohan would return to acting by starring in a Christmas romantic comedy in which she would play a hotel heiress suffering from amnesia after a skiing accident. Falling for Christmas was released on November 10, 2022, marking her first role in a major production in over a decade. Lohan performed original songs for the film's soundtrack, as well as \"Jingle Bell Rock\", which was released as a promotional single. \"Falling for Christmas\" was the most-watched holiday movie released in 2022 in the United States, that year. Lohan's performance in the film received generally positive reviews. In 2022, she also served as the narrator for Amazon Prime Video's reality dating show Lovestruck High.\nIn March 2022, Netflix revealed that Lohan had signed a deal to star in two more films for the streaming service. In September 2022, it was announced Lohan was set to star in the romantic comedy Irish Wish, which was released in March 2024. Owen Gleiberman of Variety said that \"Lohan hasn't lost her ability to light up a scene; she has a seasoned radiance.\" Stephanie Zacharek of Time agreed, and believed that \"there's something both appealing and touching about this performance\". The second film under the deal, Our Little Secret, began production in January 2024.\nIn May 2023, it was reported that Lohan would reprise her role as Anna Coleman in Freakier Friday, making it her fifth feature-film with Walt Disney Pictures. The film theatrically released on August 8, 2025.\nIn 2025, it was announced that Lohan would star in and produce Hulu's drama series Count My Lies; it will be her first starring role in a series.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nLohan has been the face of Jill Stuart, Miu Miu, and the 2008 Visa Swap British fashion campaign. She was also the face of Italian clothing company Fornarina for its Spring–Summer 2009 campaign. Lohan has a fascination with Marilyn Monroe dating to when she saw Niagara during The Parent Trap shoot. In the 2008 Spring Fashion edition of New York magazine, Lohan re-created Monroe's final photo shoot, known as The Last Sitting, including nudity, and called the shoot \"an honor\".\nIn 2008, Lohan launched a clothing line, 6126, whose name represents Monroe's birthdate (June 1, 1926). The line started with leggings before expanding to a full collection, covering 280 pieces as of April 2010. In January 2009, Lohan appeared as a guest judge on Project Runway. In September 2009, she became an artistic adviser for the French fashion house Emanuel Ungaro. A collection by designer Estrella Archs with Lohan as adviser was presented in October, receiving a \"disastrous\" reception, according to Entertainment Weekly and New York. Lohan left the company in March 2010. She appeared in the January–February 2012 issue of Playboy magazine, in a shoot inspired by a nude pictorial of Marilyn Monroe from the magazine's first issue. Editor Hugh Hefner said Lohan's issue was \"breaking sales records\".\nIn 2020, Lohan designed and released a jewelry line in collaboration with UK-based boutique brand Lily Baker. In 2022, she launched a limited-edition sneaker collection in collaboration with activewear brand Allbirds.

In 2018, she opened a beach resort on the Greek island Mykonos and later her second resort in Ialisos Beach, Rhodes.\n\n\n=== Digital ===\nIn 2014, the free-to-play video game app Lindsay Lohan's The Price of Fame was released for the iOS and Android operating systems. In 2017, Lohan launched a lifestyle site, Preemium, which subscribers could access for $2.99 a month.\nIn 2021, Red Arrow's Studio71 revealed it had signed Lohan to host and launch a new podcast. It was then announced the podcast would be titled The Lohdown with Lindsay Lohan. It premiered in April 2022 and ran until September of that year.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nLohan's personal life has received much media attention since her teenage years, particularly after a series of legal problems and arrests, which continued until 2013. The year 2015 marked the first time she had been probation-free in over eight years. She had a turbulent childhood that she spoke about in 2007, the year her parents finalized their divorce: \"I feel like a second parent in the sense that I helped raise my family ... I was put between my mother and father a lot\". Despite the conflicts, Lohan spoke very fondly of her family. But in the late 2000s, she said she had cut off contact with her father, calling his behavior unpredictable and hard to deal with. In 2023, Lohan said she was on good terms with both her parents as the family gathered in April, which reportedly marked the first time they were all together in at least seven years.\nLohan has had many high-profile relationships, including with actor Wilmer Valderrama in 2004, Hard Rock Cafe heir Harry Morton in 2006, DJ Samantha Ronson in 2008, and London-based Russian business heir Egor Tarabasov in 2016. On November 28, 2021, Lohan announced her engagement to financier Bader Shammas after three years of dating. Bader Shammas is a Kuwaiti citizen and a member of the Shammas family, one of the twelve Kuwaiti Christian families. On July 2, 2022, a representative confirmed Lohan and Shammas were married after she called him her \"husband\" on her Instagram birthday post. Lohan later revealed they had wed on April 3, 2022. In July 2023, she gave birth to their son in Dubai, where she has resided since 2014.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\nAfter beginning her acting career as a child actor in the early 1990s, Lohan, at age eleven, made her film debut in Disney's hugely successful remake of The Parent Trap (1998). Freaky Friday (2003) remains her highest-grossing film, while Mean Girls (2004), both a critical and commercial success, became a cult classic. Though her career was often interrupted by legal and personal troubles during the late 2000s and early 2010s, she has appeared in over 30 films and has multiple other acting credits as of 2025.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nSpeak (2004)\nA Little More Personal (Raw) (2005)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of awards and nominations received by Lindsay Lohan\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. Dance Club Songs chart\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Cited works ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nLindsay Lohan at IMDb",

        "content": "Dean George Cain (né Tanaka; born July 31, 1966) is an American actor best known for portraying Superman in the 1990s television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Cain was also the host of Ripley's Believe It or Not! and appeared in the sports drama series Hit the Floor.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDean George Tanaka was born on July 31, 1966, at Selfridge Air Force Base in Harrison Township, Michigan. His mother, Sharon Thomas, was an actress. Cain is mixed-race; His father, Roger Tanaka, was an American serviceman of Japanese descent, the son of John Megumi Tanaka and Miyoko Tanaka. Cain said that several members of his family were interned at the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Idaho as part of the Internment of Japanese Americans. The rest of Cain's ancestry is Welsh, Irish, and French Canadian. \nCain said of his father, whom he never met, \"He's not the kind of man I want to be. He was an unfaithful husband and not much of a father.\" Soon after Dean's birth, his mother, pursuing an acting career, moved him and his older brother Roger to Los Angeles. In 1969, Sharon married the film director Christopher Cain, who adopted Dean and Roger, and he took his stepfather's surname. The couple moved to Malibu, California, and had a daughter, Krisinda.\nCain attended Santa Monica High School, where he excelled in sports. Among his schoolmates were Charlie Sheen, who played on the same baseball team as Cain when they were children, as well as Rob Lowe and his brother Chad. Cain graduated from high school in 1984 and attended Princeton University, where he majored in American history. He dated actress Brooke Shields, whom he met in a religion class at the university. Cain graduated in 1988 with a bachelor of arts in history. His senior thesis was \"The History and Development of the Functions of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\".\n\n\n=== Football ===\nAt Princeton, Cain starred as a free safety on the football team. He began his career as a cornerback, making his first start during his sophomore year in 1985. In the season opener, he contributed to Princeton's 10–3 victory over Dartmouth by diving for an underthrown pass that would have resulted in a Dartmouth touchdown to record his first interception. Against Cornell in the final game of 1985, he intercepted Marty Stallone thrice to help the Tigers win 33–27. At the end of the season, he was an honorable mention on the All-Ivy League team. Cain switched to safety for 1986, a position he preferred since it had \"a lot of action\", and led the Tigers in tackles.\nAs a senior in 1987, he set the NCAA Division I-AA record for most interceptions in a season with 12, surpassing the 11 by Bill McGovern in 1984. His record stood until Rashean Mathis had 14 in 2002. Cain began the year with a two-interception performance against Dartmouth, then had his school-best 13th career pick the following week versus Davidson. In the season finale, Cain picked off Cornell three times in a seven-interception performance for the Princeton defense. The Associated Press named him a first team I-AA All-American, and he also received the John P. Poe–Richard W. Kazmaier Jr. Football Trophy for the year. He finished his collegiate career with a school-record 22 interceptions in 30 games.\nAfter his graduation in 1988, he signed on as a free agent with the National Football League's Buffalo Bills. He hurt his right knee during training camp, which prevented him from playing in the preseason and he underwent an arthroscopy in late July. Cain was placed on the Bills' injured reserve list for the season. The injury ended his football career prematurely.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWith little hope of returning to sports, Cain turned to screenwriting and then acting, shooting dozens of commercials, including a volleyball-themed spot for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and appearing on such popular television shows as Grapevine, A Different World, and Beverly Hills, 90210.\n\nIn 1993, Cain took his biggest role to date, that of Superman in the television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. At the height of its popularity, the program drew an average of at least 15 million viewers per episode. The series ran for four seasons, ending in 1997. Cain later made his first return to the Superman franchise with a special guest role in a season seven episode of Smallville, as the immortal Dr. Curtis Knox, a character based upon the DC Comics villain Vandal Savage; Cain returned to the Superman universe again between 2015 and 2017, in a recurring role on Supergirl, as the title character's foster father, Jeremiah Danvers.\nIn 1998, Cain started the Angry Dragon Entertainment production company, which produced the TBS Superstation television series Ripley's Believe It or Not!

In 2012, he participated in Fox's dating game show The Choice.\nIn 2013, Cain hosted a reality show about Bigfoot titled 10 Million Dollar Bigfoot Bounty, where he offered contestants $10 million to prove the existence of Bigfoot. Cain later appeared in the mid-season premiere of Comic Book Men, appearing at Kevin Smith's Secret Stash where the crew was celebrating 75 years of Superman, where it was claimed that his portrayal of the character helped people care about Superman again.  Cain appeared in the film God's Not Dead, in which he plays an arrogant businessman.

In October 2018, it was learned that Ronnie Mund (Ronnie the Limo Driver), the personal driver and bodyguard of radio DJ Howard Stern, had been using a photoshopped picture of Cain as a publicity photo. Specifically, Mund's head had been transposed onto the body of Cain. Mund initially denied the photo was altered but eventually acknowledged he had been using the fraudulent photo for over five years. Mund claimed he was unaware the photo was not genuine. Cain co-starred in the 2018 film Gosnell: The Trial of America's Biggest Serial Killer about the investigation and trial of Kermit Gosnell. He also starred in the 2018 film Andy the Talking Hedgehog.\nIn 2019, Cain starred in the play FBI Lovebirds alongside Kristy Swanson, a play that mocked Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two FBI agents who were briefly on the team investigating Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.\nIn June 2021, it was announced that he would make his directorial debut with Little Angels and star in it.\nCain is the Actor in Residence at High Point University.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFor two years in the 1980s, Cain dated Brooke Shields, an actress, while they were attending Princeton University. In 1992, he dated Gabrielle Reece, a professional beach-volleyball player and model. In 1997, Cain became engaged to Mindy McCready, a singer; they broke up in 1998.\nHe has a son, Christopher Cain, born June 11, 2000, with one of his ex-girlfriends, Samantha Torres, a Playboy Playmate and model.

In 2020, he joined the Pocatello Police Department in Idaho as a reserve police officer. He also subsequently joined the Frederick County, Virginia Sheriff's Office as a reserve deputy sheriff.\n\n\n=== Political views ===\n\nCain voted for Bill Clinton twice in 1992 and 1996, as well as for Al Gore in 2000, the latter of which he later said he \"regretted\". He supported John McCain in 2008 and supported Rick Perry at the Republican primaries in 2012. In 2016, 2020, and 2024, he endorsed and voted for Donald Trump.\nIn 2018, Cain was elected to the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America. That same year, Cain said that he was once a registered Republican, but later became a registered Independent, feeling that the Republican Party did not \"fully represent his views\".\nIn 2025, Cain released a video indicating that he had joined Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), encouraging others to \"join the agency as well\".\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Video games ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDean Cain at IMDb\nDean Cain on Yahoo movies",

Initially conceived as a book, it was then planned for pick-up by ITV. At the time, Fellowes planned to focus the show around Lord Grantham and Cora's romance and eventual marriage as the Earl and Countess of Grantham.\nProduction and writing for The Gilded Age was updated in January 2016. Asked whether he'd written the script yet, Fellowes said, 'No I haven't, no. I'm doing that this year', before adding: 'And then hopefully shooting at the end of the year.'\"\nOn June 4, 2016, Fellowes was asked by the Los Angeles Times, \"Where does The Gilded Age stand?\" Fellowes replied, \"It stands really with me up to my neck in research, and I'm clearing the decks, so that when I start Gilded Age, I'm only doing Gilded Age. These people were extraordinary. You can see why they frightened the old guard, because they saw no boundaries. They wanted to build a palace, they built a palace. They wanted to buy a yacht, they bought a yacht. And the old guard in New York weren't like that at all, and suddenly this whirlwind of couture descended on their heads. They redesigned being rich. They created a rich culture that we still have—people who are rich are rich in a way that was established in America in the 1880s, '90s, 1900s. It was different from Europe. Something like Newport would never have happened in any other country, where you have huge palaces, and then about 20 yards away, another huge palace, and 20 yards beyond that another huge palace. In England right up to the 1930s, when people made good money, they would buy an estate of 5,000 acres and they'd have to look after Nanny. The Americans of the 1880s and '90s didn't want too much of that.\"\nThe final confirmation the show would be produced was announced by NBC in January 2018. NBC originally announced that the show would consist of ten episodes and premiere in 2019. About the show, Fellowes stated: \"To write The Gilded Age is the fulfillment of a personal dream, I have been fascinated by this period of American history for many years and now NBC has given me the chance to bring it to a modern audience. I could not be more excited and thrilled. The truth is, America is a wonderful country with a rich and varied history, and nothing could give me more pleasure than be the person to bring that compelling history to the screen.\"\nIn May 2019, the series moved from NBC to HBO, with a straight to series order. The series premiered on January 24, 2022, and consists of nine episodes.\nOn February 14, 2022, HBO renewed the series for a second season.\nOn December 21, 2023, HBO renewed the series for a third season.\nOn July 28, 2025, HBO renewed the series for a fourth season.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn September 2019, the production announced an initial cast consisting of Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon, Amanda Peet, and Morgan Spector.\nIn November 2019, it was announced that Denée Benton, Louisa Jacobson, Taissa Farmiga, Blake Ritson, and Simon Jones would be joining the show. In January 2020, Harry Richardson, Thomas Cocquerel, and Jack Gilpin were cast as series regulars, with Jeanne Tripplehorn cast in a recurring role.\nIn April 2020, Carrie Coon was cast as Bertha Russell to replace Peet because of delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This caused the costuming team to change their approach, using the way Coon presents herself as inspiration for more metallic-colored dresses intended to evoke the burgeoning machine age.\nIn January 2021, Nathan Lane joined the cast in a recurring role.\nIn April 2022, it was announced several members of the recurring cast had been upgraded to series regular status for the second season while Cocquerel will exit the series.\nIn August 2024, Bill Camp, Merritt Wever, Leslie Uggams, LisaGay Hamilton, Jessica Frances Dukes, Andrea Martin, Hattie Morahan and Paul Alexander Nolan were cast to join the third season.\nIn November 2024, Dylan Baker, Kate Baldwin, Michael Cumpsty, John Ellison Conlee, Bobby Steggert, and Hannah Shealy were cast to join the third season.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nFollowing the move to HBO, the series was expected to begin filming in March 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic delayed production.\nFilming of the series began in Newport, Rhode Island in February 2021, at the mansions Chateau-sur-Mer, The Elms, and The Breakers. A casting call for Rhode Islanders to work as extras on the series was made in December 2020 prior to the production setting up in the city.\nIn April 2021, filming continued at the Lyndhurst mansion in Tarrytown, New York and the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, New York. In May 2021, filming continued in Troy, New York in its Central Troy Historic District, where multiple city blocks were transformed to resemble a Victorian era street.\nDuring filming, a horse died on set and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals asked for an investigation. HBO subsequently issued a statement confirming the death in late June, saying, \"a horse collapsed and died, likely of natural causes, according to a veterinarian's preliminary findings.\"\nFilming for season two began in August 2022 at various locations around White Plains, New York, including Manhattanville College's Reid Hall, which was used for various locations, including offices, a home parlor and an art gallery/museum. Reid Hall was designed by Stanford White and built in 1892 for the family of newspaper publisher and diplomat, Whitelaw Reid.\nOther New York locations included Albany, Cohoes, Troy and on Long Island, and the series also filmed in Philadelphia. Scenes set at Susan Blane's home were filmed at Kingscote in Newport. The street backlot is near to Old Bethpage, New York in Long Island.\nThe third season started filming in July 2024.\n\n\n=== Legal issue ===\nOn May 21, 2021, the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada (AFM) filed a charge for unfair labor practices against HBO and its Gilded Age production. The union claimed musicians were fired after asking they be represented by AFM. Two days later HBO agreed to cover the members \"on an AFM basis\".\n\n\n=== Real-life events ===\nAlthough The Gilded Age is a work of fiction, Julian Fellowes worked to accurately represent certain realities of the time period.\nCaroline Schermerhorn Astor, also known as \"The\" Mrs. Astor, ruled New York society in the late nineteenth century. Descending from Dutch settlers, the \"knickerbocker\" married relatively new money William Backhouse Astor Jr. At the time the series takes place, Astor (Donna Murphy) and her husband are largely estranged. Dismayed by the chaos caused by the end of the Civil War and the rise of new money, and armed with her own distinguished lineage and her husband's fortune, she became the gatekeeper to high society. She and her associate Ward McAllister (Nathan Lane) decreed that members of respectable society must be separated by at least three generations from the origin of the family fortune, as she herself was. McAllister, Mrs. Astor's right-hand man, spent years across the Atlantic absorbing culture, details of European courts, and society news. Although some recognized his devotion to preserving elegance and tradition, others saw him as an unapologetic snob.\nTwo characters, Bertha and George Russell (Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector), appear to be at least partly based on the formidable Alva and William K. Vanderbilt. Alva Erskine Vanderbilt (later Alva Belmont) came from a wealthy Mobile, Alabama, family that lost its money after the Civil War. Determined to regain her social status, she married a scion of the immensely wealthy Vanderbilt family in 1875, but the Vanderbilts were considered too \"new money\" by Caroline Astor and were largely ignored. In order to ascend to the upper echelons of society, Alva Vanderbilt set out to impress Caroline Astor. Among her strategies, she hired society architect Richard Morris Hunt to build a luxurious mansion on Fifth Avenue, then hosted an enormous, extravagant ball for 1,000 as a \"house-warming\". The details of the festivities were leaked in advance to the press, and young society waited breathlessly for the upcoming ball — including Caroline Astor's daughter, Carrie. Caroline Astor was forced to call on Alva Vanderbilt to ensure her daughter received an invitation. The ball was a success and the family was accepted into New York high society.\nOther historical figures who appear in the series include President Chester A. Arthur (Randall Passman), Clara Barton (Linda Emond), founder of the American Red Cross, and T. Thomas Fortune (Sullivan Jones), a man born into slavery who would become one of the leading Black journalists of his day. In his editorials, he wrote passionately about civil rights and denounced racial segregation and discrimination. He also helped found a predecessor to the NAACP, the Afro-American League.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe series premiered on January 24, 2022, on HBO and HBO Max. In Australia, Paramount+ acquired the series as a \"Paramount+ Exclusive\", premiering on January 26, 2022. This also marks the first time a recent HBO series has skipped Foxtel in Australia, premiering on a non-Foxtel service as Foxtel has an output deal for HBO shows.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe first season was released on DVD, on July 26, 2022.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\n\n==== Season 1 ====\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season of The Gilded Age holds an approval rating of 79% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Julian Fellowes' brand of upstairs, downstairs intrigue makes a seamless transatlantic transition in The Gilded Age, with an outstanding cast making the travails of the rich a compelling watch.\" Metacritic assigned the season a score of 68 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nLinda Holmes of NPR praised the series as \"sharp and well-cast\", noting that while it shares similarities with Downton Abbey, it distinguishes itself by focusing on the dynamics between old and new money in 1882 New York City.\nConversely, Lucy Mangan of The Guardian criticized the show, describing it as \"sheer agony\" and questioning the quality of its dialogue and character development.\n\n\n==== Season 2 ====\nThe second season received a higher approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, standing at 94% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus states: \"More topical than before while also owning its frivolous appeal with unapologetic splendor, Julian Fellowes' operatic soap enters its own halcyon age.\" On Metacritic, the season has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 21 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nKaiya Shunyata of RogerEbert.com commended the season for allowing its sprawling cast to shine, particularly highlighting Carrie Coon's performance as Bertha Russell. Kristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly described the season as \"opulent, over-the-top escapism\", appreciating its lavish production and melodramatic storytelling.\nHowever, Chitra Ramaswamy of The Guardian offered a more critical view, noting that while the show is visually impressive, it lacks the sharpness and wit expected from such a period drama.\n\n\n==== Season 3 ====\nFor the third season, Rotten Tomatoes reported an 95% approval rating based on 34 reviews. The site's critical consensus is: \"Providing its gleaming ensemble with some of their juiciest material yet, The Gilded Age's tongue is still firmly in cheek but finds itself with plenty new to say.\" Metacritic assigned the season a score of 73 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Gilded Age at IMDb",

        "title": "Gavin Newsom",
        "content": "Gavin Christopher Newsom ( NEW-səm; born October 10, 1967) is an American politician and businessman serving since 2019 as the 40th governor of California. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 49th lieutenant governor of California from 2011 to 2019 and as the 42nd mayor of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011.\nNewsom graduated from Santa Clara University in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science in political science. Afterward, he founded the boutique winery PlumpJack Group in Oakville, California, with billionaire heir and family friend Gordon Getty as an investor. The company grew to manage 23 businesses, including wineries, restaurants, and hotels. Newsom began his political career in 1996, when San Francisco mayor Willie Brown appointed him to the city's Parking and Traffic Commission. Brown then appointed Newsom to fill a vacancy on the Board of Supervisors the next year and Newsom was first elected to the board in 1998.\nNewsom was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003 and reelected in 2007. He was elected lieutenant governor of California in 2010 and reelected in 2014. As lieutenant governor, Newsom hosted The Gavin Newsom Show from 2012 to 2013 and in 2013 wrote the book Citizenville, which focuses on using digital tools for democratic change. Since 2025, he has hosted the podcast This is Gavin Newsom.\nNewsom was elected governor of California in 2018. During his tenure, he faced criticism for his personal behavior and leadership style during the COVID-19 pandemic that contributed to an unsuccessful recall effort in 2021. Newsom was reelected in 2022.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGavin Christopher Newsom was born on October 10, 1967, in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (née Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a state appeals court judge and attorney for Getty Oil. A fourth-generation San Franciscan, Newsom comes from a prominent family with deep ties to the city. His maternal great-grandfather Thomas Addis was a pioneering nephrologist and professor of medicine at Stanford University noted for his groundbreaking research on kidney disease. Newsom is a second cousin twice removed of musician Joanna Newsom, and his aunt Barbara Newsom was married to Ron Pelosi, the brother-in-law of former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Newsom's parents divorced in 1971 when he was three years old, leaving his mother, Tessa, to raise him and his younger sister, Hilary Newsom Callan, largely on her own. Tessa worked three jobs—often as a waitress, bookkeeper, and secretary—to support the family, fostering a strong work ethic in her children. Newsom has called his childhood challenging, shaped in part by financial instability and his struggle with \"pretty severe\" dyslexia, a condition he still has.\nNewsom's education began at École Notre Dame des Victoires, a French-American bilingual Catholic school in San Francisco that he attended for kindergarten and first grade. But his severe dyslexia—which affected his ability to read, write, spell, and perform numerical tasks (dyscalculia)—prompted a transfer. He continued at Notre Dame des Victoires from third through fifth grades, where he was enrolled in remedial reading classes to cope with his learning difficulties. Throughout his years in school, Newsom relied heavily on audiobooks, summaries, and verbal instruction. He still prefers audio interpretations of documents and reports. In a 2023 interview, he said his dyslexia \"forced me to find workarounds and think differently—skills I still use every day as governor.\" At Redwood High School in Larkspur, California, Newsom excelled athletically despite his academic struggles, graduating in 1985. He played basketball as a shooting guard and baseball as an outfielder, earning recognition on the cover of the Marin Independent Journal for his skills. His sister Hilary recalled lean Christmases when their mother warned them not to expect gifts, underscoring the family's financial strain. Tessa opened their home to foster children, a practice that Newsom has said instilled in him a lifelong commitment to public service. His father's habit of donating much of his income further tightened the family's finances, leading Newsom to take various jobs—such as washing cars and working at a local deli—during high school to help out.\nNewsom enrolled at Santa Clara University on a partial baseball scholarship, graduating in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science in political science. He tried out for the baseball team during his first two years but underwent elbow surgery in late 1985—later revealed as a procedure to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament—ending his varsity aspirations. He has credited the university's Jesuit education with fostering his independent thinking and skepticism of conventional wisdom. During his junior year, Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in Rome, Italy, an experience he called \"eye-opening\" in a 2019 speech, exposing him to global perspectives that influenced his political career.\n\n\n== Business career ==\nNewsom and his investors created the company PlumpJack Associates L.P. on May 14, 1991. The group started the PlumpJack Winery in 1992 with the financial help of his family friend Gordon Getty. PlumpJack was the name of an opera written by Getty, who invested in 10 of Newsom's 11 businesses. Getty told the San Francisco Chronicle that he treated Newsom like a son and invested in his first business venture because of that relationship. According to Getty, later business investments were because of \"the success of the first\".\nOne of Newsom's early interactions with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Department of Public Health's requirement to install a sink at his PlumpJack wine store. The Health Department argued that wine was a food and required the store to install a $2,700 sink in the carpeted wine shop on the grounds that the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed supervisor, he told the San Francisco Examiner: \"That's the kind of bureaucratic malaise I'm going to be working through.\"\nThe business grew to an enterprise with more than 700 employees. The PlumpJack Cafe Partners L.P. opened the PlumpJack Café, also on Fillmore Street, in 1993. Between 1993 and 2000, Newsom and his investors opened several other businesses that included the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn with a PlumpJack Café (1994), a winery in Napa Valley (1995), the Balboa Café Bar and Grill (1995), the PlumpJack Development Fund L.P. (1996), the MatrixFillmore Bar (1998), PlumpJack Wines shop Noe Valley branch (1999), PlumpJackSport retail clothing (2000), and a second Balboa Café at Squaw Valley (2000). Newsom's investments included five restaurants and two retail clothing stores. Newsom's annual income was greater than $429,000 from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, his business holdings were valued at more than $6.9 million. Newsom gave a monthly $50 gift certificate to PlumpJack employees whose business ideas failed, because in his view, \"There can be no success without failure.\"\nNewsom sold his share of his San Francisco businesses when he became mayor in 2004. He maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco, including the PlumpJack Winery in Oakville, California, new PlumpJack-owned Cade Winery in Angwin, California, and the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn. He is the president in absentia of Airelle Wines Inc., which is connected to the PlumpJack Winery in Napa County. Newsom earned between $141,000 and $251,000 in 2007 from his business interests. In February 2006, he paid $2,350,000 for his residence in the Russian Hill neighborhood, which he put on the market in April 2009 for $3,000,000.\nAt the time of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, it was acknowledged that at least three of Newsom's wine companies, PlumpJack, Cade and Odette, were Silicon Valley Bank clients.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\n\nNewsom's first political experience came when he volunteered for Willie Brown's successful campaign for mayor in 1995. Newsom hosted a private fundraiser at his PlumpJack Café. Brown appointed Newsom to a vacant seat on the Parking and Traffic Commission in 1996, and he was later elected president of the commission. Brown appointed him to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors seat vacated by Kevin Shelley in 1997. At the time, he was the youngest member of San Francisco's board of supervisors.\nNewsom was sworn in by his father and pledged to bring his business experience to the board. Brown called Newsom \"part of the future generation of leaders of this great city\". Newsom described himself as a \"social liberal and a fiscal watchdog\". He was elected to a full four-year term to the board in 1998. San Francisco voters chose to abandon at-large elections to the board for the previous district system in 1999. Newsom was reelected in 2000 and 2002 to represent the second district, which includes Pacific Heights, the Marina, Cow Hollow, Sea Cliff and Laurel Heights, which had San Francisco's highest income level and highest Republican registration. Newsom paid $500 to the San Francisco Republican Party to appear on the party's endorsement slate in 2000 while running for Supervisor. He was reelected.\nAs a San Francisco Supervisor, Newsom gained public attention for his role in advocating reform of the city's municipal railway (Muni). He was one of two supervisors endorsed by Rescue Muni, a transit riders group, in his 1998 reelection. He sponsored Proposition B to require Muni and other city departments to develop detailed customer service plans. The measure passed with 56.6% of the vote. Newsom sponsored a ballot measure from Rescue Muni; a version of the measure was approved by voters in November 1999.\nNewsom also supported allowing restaurants to serve alcohol at their outdoor tables, banning tobacco advertisements visible from the streets, stiffer penalties for landlords who run afoul of rent-control laws, and a resolution, which was defeated, to commend Colin Powell for raising money for youth programs. Newsom's support for business interests at times strained his relationship with labor leaders.\nDuring Newsom's time as supervisor, he supported housing projects through public-private partnerships to increase homeownership and affordable housing in San Francisco. He supported HOPE, a failed local-ballot measure that would have allowed an increased condo-conversion rate if a certain percentage of tenants within a building were buying their units. As a candidate for mayor, he supported building 10,000 new housing units to create 15,000 new construction jobs.\nNewsom's signature achievement as a supervisor was a voter initiative called Care Not Cash (Measure N), which offered care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists for the homeless in lieu of direct cash aid from the state's general assistance program. Many homeless rights advocates protested against the initiative. \"Progressives and Democrats, nuns and priests, homeless advocates and homeless people were furious\", Newsom said. The successfully passed ballot measure raised his political profile and provided the volunteers, donors, and campaign staff that helped make him a leading contender for the mayorship in 2003. In a city audit released in 2008, the program was evaluated as largely successful for lowering average cash payments per person from over $300 to $78 and the number of people receiving cash payments from over 2,500 to about 640.\n\n\n== Mayor of San Francisco (2004–2011) ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== 2003 ====\n\nNewsom placed first in the November 4, 2003, general election in a nine-person field. He received 41.9% of the vote to Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez's 19.6% in the first round of balloting, but faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff, when many of the city's progressive groups supported Gonzalez. The race was partisan, with attacks against Gonzalez for his support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election, and attacks against Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate mailer in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported. Democratic leadership felt they needed to reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the 2003 gubernatorial recall election to Arnold Schwarzenegger. National Democratic Party figures, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson, campaigned for Newsom. Five supervisors endorsed Gonzalez, while Willie Brown endorsed Newsom.\nNewsom won the runoff with 53% of the vote to Gonzalez's 47%, a margin of 11,000 votes. He ran as a business-friendly centrist Democrat and a moderate in San Francisco politics. Some of his opponents called him conservative. Newsom claimed he was a centrist in the Dianne Feinstein mold. He ran on the slogan \"great cities, great ideas\", and presented over 21 policy papers. He pledged to continue working on San Francisco's homelessness issue.\nNewsom was sworn in as mayor on January 8, 2004. He called for unity among the city's political factions, and promised to address the issues of public schools, potholes and affordable housing. Newsom said he was \"a different kind of leader\" who \"isn't afraid to solve even the toughest problems\".\n\n\n==== 2007 ====\n\nSan Francisco's progressive community tried to field a candidate to run a strong campaign against Newsom. Supervisors Ross Mirkarimi and Chris Daly considered running, but both declined. Gonzalez also decided not to challenge Newsom again.\nWhen the August 10, 2007, filing deadline passed, San Francisco's discussion shifted to talk about Newsom's second term. He was challenged in the election by 13 candidates, including George Davis, a nudist activist, and Michael Powers, owner of the Power Exchange sex club. Conservative former supervisor Tony Hall withdrew by early September due to lack of support.\nThe San Francisco Chronicle declared in August 2007 that Newsom faced no \"serious threat to his re-election bid\", having raised $1.6 million for his reelection campaign by early August. He was reelected on November 6 with over 72% of the vote. Upon taking office for a second term, Newsom promised to focus on the environment, homelessness, health care, education, housing, and rebuilding San Francisco General Hospital.\n\n\n=== Mayoralty ===\n\nAs mayor, Newsom focused on development projects in Hunters Point and Treasure Island.\nHe gained national attention in 2004 when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, violating a state law passed in 2000. Implementation of Care Not Cash, the initiative he had sponsored as a supervisor, began on July 1, 2004. As part of the initiative, 5,000 more homeless people were given permanent shelter in the city. About 2,000 people had been placed into permanent housing with support by 2007. Other programs Newsom initiated to end chronic homelessness included the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT) and Project Homeless Connect (PHC), which placed 2,000 homeless people into permanent housing and provided 5,000 additional affordable rental units in the city.\nDuring a strike by hotel workers against a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line in front of the Westin St. Francis Hotel on October 27, 2004. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events at them until they agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.\nIn 2005, Newsom pushed for a state law to allow California communities to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. In 2007, he signed the law establishing Healthy San Francisco to provide city residents with universal health care, the first city in the nation to do so.\nNewsom came under attack from the San Francisco Democratic Party in 2009 for his failure to implement the City of San Francisco's sanctuary city rule, under which the city was to not assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nThe same year, Newsom received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award, along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and three other public officials, for his commitment to making healthful food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families. He hosted the Urban-Rural Roundtable in 2008 to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy, affordable food. Newsom secured $8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program, which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes. He signed a menu-labeling bill into law, requiring that chain restaurants print nutrition information on their menus.\nNewsom was named \"America's Most Social Mayor\" in 2010 by Same Point, based on analysis of the social media profiles of mayors of the 100 largest U.S. cities.\n\n\n=== Same-sex marriage ===\nNewsom gained national attention in 2004 when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, violating state law. In August 2004, the Supreme Court of California annulled the marriages Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law. Still, Newsom's unexpected move brought national attention to the issue of same-sex marriage, solidifying political support for him in San Francisco and in the LGBTQ+ community.\nDuring the 2008 election, Newsom opposed Proposition 8, the ballot initiative to reverse the Supreme Court of California ruling that there was a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Proposition 8 supporters released a commercial featuring footage of Newsom saying the following in a speech regarding same-sex marriage: \"This door's wide open now. It's going to happen, whether you like it or not.\" Some observers noted that polls shifted in favor of Proposition 8 after the commercial's release; this, in turn, led to speculation that Newsom had inadvertently played a role in the amendment's passage.\n\n\n== Lieutenant governor of California (2011–2019) ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== 2010 ====\n\nNewsom filed initial paperwork to run for lieutenant governor in February 2010, and officially announced his candidacy in March. He received the Democratic nomination in June and won the election on November 2. Newsom was sworn in as lieutenant governor on January 10, 2011, and served under Governor Jerry Brown.\nWhile lieutenant governor, in May 2012, Newsom began hosting The Gavin Newsom Show on Current TV. The same month, he drew criticism for calling Sacramento \"dull\" and saying he was only there once a week, adding \"there's no reason\" to be there otherwise.\n\n\n==== 2014 ====\n\nNewsom was reelected as lieutenant governor on November 4, 2014, defeating Republican Ron Nehring with 57.2% of the vote. His second term began on January 5, 2015.\n\n\n=== Capital punishment ===\nNewsom supported a failed measure in 2012 that sought to end capital punishment in California. He claimed the initiative would save California millions of dollars, citing statistics that California had spent $5 billion since 1978 to execute just 13 people.\nIn 2016, Newsom supported Proposition 62, which also would have repealed the death penalty in California. He argued that Prop. 62 would get rid of a system \"that is administered with troubling racial disparities\" and said that the death penalty was fundamentally immoral and did not deter crime. Proposition 62 failed.\n\n\n=== Criminal justice and cannabis legalization ===\nIn 2014, Newsom was the only statewide politician to endorse California Proposition 47, legislation that recategorized certain nonviolent offenses like drug and property crimes as misdemeanors as opposed to felonies. Voters passed the measure on November 4, 2014.\nIn July 2015, Newsom released the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy's final report, which he had convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013. The report's recommendations to regulate marijuana were intended to inform a legalization measure on the November 2016 ballot. Newsom supported the resulting measure, Proposition 64, which legalized cannabis use and cultivation for California state residents who are 21 or older.\nOn February 24, 2017, in response to pro-enforcement statements by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Newsom sent Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Donald Trump a letter urging them not to increase federal enforcement against recreational cannabis firms opening in California. He wrote: \"The government must not strip the legal and publicly supported industry of its business and hand it back to drug cartels and criminals ... Dealers don't card kids. I urge you and your administration to work in partnership with California and the other eight states that have legalized recreational marijuana for adult use in a way that will let us enforce our state laws that protect the public and our children while targeting the bad actors.\" Newsom responded to comments by Spicer that compared cannabis to opioids: \"Unlike marijuana, opioids represent an addictive and harmful substance, and I would welcome your administration's focused efforts on tackling this particular public health crisis.\"\n\n\n=== Education ===\nNewsom joined Long Beach City College Superintendent Eloy Oakley in a November 2015 op-ed calling for the creation of the California College Promise, which would create partnerships between public schools, public universities, and employers and offer a free community college education. Throughout 2016, he joined Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf at the launch of the Oakland Promise and Second Lady Jill Biden and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti at the launch of the LA Promise. In June 2016, Newsom helped secure $15 million in the state budget to support the creation of promise programs throughout the state.\nIn December 2015, Newsom called on the University of California to reclassify computer science courses as a core academic class to incentivize more high schools to offer computer science curricula. He sponsored successful legislation signed by Governor Brown in September 2016, that began the planning process for expanding computer science education to all state students, beginning as early as kindergarten.\nIn 2016, Newsom passed a series of reforms at the University of California to give student-athletes additional academic and injury-related support, and to ensure that contracts for athletic directors and coaches emphasized academic progress. This came in response to several athletics programs, including the University of California–Berkeley's football team, which had the lowest graduation rates in the country.\n\n\n=== Technology in government ===\nNewsom released his first book, Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government, on February 7, 2013. The book discusses the Gov 2.0 movement taking place across the nation. After its release, Newsom began to work with the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at the University of California, Berkeley, on the California Report Card (CRC). The CRC is a mobile-optimized platform that allows state residents to \"grade\" their state on six timely issues. The CRC exemplifies ideas presented in Citizenville, encouraging direct public involvement in government affairs via technology.\nIn 2015, Newsom partnered with the Institute for Advanced Technology and Public Policy at California Polytechnic State University to launch Digital Democracy, an online tool that uses facial and voice recognition to enable users to navigate California legislative proceedings.\n\n\n== Gubernatorial campaigns (2010–2022) ==\n\n\n=== 2010 election ===\n\nOn April 21, 2009, Newsom announced his candidacy for governor of California in the 2010 election. He named state senator (and future U.S. senator) Alex Padilla to chair his campaign. He received former president Bill Clinton's endorsement in September. Throughout the campaign, he had low poll numbers, trailing Democratic frontrunner Jerry Brown by more than 20 points in most polls. Newsom dropped out of the race in October and ran for lieutenant governor instead.\n\n\n=== 2018 election ===\n\nOn February 11, 2015, Newsom announced that he was opening a campaign account for governor in the 2018 elections, allowing him to raise funds for a campaign to succeed Brown as governor of California. On June 5, 2018, he finished in the top two in the nonpartisan blanket primary, and he defeated Republican John H. Cox by a landslide in the November 6 general election.\nNewsom was sworn in on January 7, 2019.\n\n\n=== 2021 recall election ===\n\nSeveral recall attempts were launched against Newsom early in his tenure, but they failed to gain much traction. On February 21, 2020, a recall petition was introduced by Orrin Heatlie, a deputy sheriff in Yolo County. The petition mentioned Newsom's sanctuary state policy and said laws he endorsed favored \"foreign nationals, in our country illegally\"; said that California had high homelessness, high taxes, and low quality of life; and described other grievances. The California secretary of state approved it for circulation on June 10, 2020.\nForcing the gubernatorial recall election required a total of 1,495,709 verified signatures. By August 2020, 55,000 signatures were submitted and verified by the secretary of state, and 890 new valid signatures were submitted by October 2020. The petition was initially given a signature deadline of November 17, 2020, but it was extended to March 17, 2021, after Judge James P. Arguelles ruled that petitioners could have more time because of the pandemic. Newsom's attendance at a party at The French Laundry in November 2020, despite his public health measures; voter anger over lockdowns, job losses, school and business closures; and a $31 billion fraud scandal at the state unemployment agency were credited for the recall's growing support. The French Laundry event took place on November 6, and between November 5 and December 7 over 442,000 new signatures were submitted and verified; 1,664,010 verified signatures, representing roughly 98% of the final total of 1,719,900, were submitted between November 2020 and March 17, 2021.\nDuring the campaign, Newsom compared the recall effort to the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. On September 14, 2021, the recall election was held, and only 38% voted to recall Newsom, so he remained in office.\n\n\n=== 2022 election ===\n\nIn 2022, Newsom was elected to a second term, defeating Republican state senator Brian Dahle with 59.2% of the vote. This was a smaller margin of victory than in 2018, and the first time since 2010 that the Democratic gubernatorial nominee did not win at least 60% of the vote.\n\n\n== Governor of California (2019–present) ==\nA CalMatters analysis published in 2019 found Newsom's political positions to be more moderate than those of almost every Democratic state legislator in California.\n\n\n=== Appointments ===\nAfter U.S. senator Kamala Harris was elected vice president of the United States in the 2020 presidential election, Newsom appointed Secretary of State of California Alex Padilla to succeed her as California's junior U.S. senator. To replace Padilla as secretary of state, Newsom appointed Assemblywoman Shirley Weber. After the U.S. Senate confirmed Xavier Becerra as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Newsom appointed Rob Bonta Attorney General of California. In an interview with Joy Reid, Newsom was asked whether he would appoint a Black woman to replace Dianne Feinstein if she were to retire from the Senate or die before her term ended in 2024; Newsom replied that he would. Feinstein died in September 2023, and Newsom faced pressure to quickly appoint a successor. He fulfilled his promise and appointed Laphonza Butler to the seat.\n\n\n=== Criminal justice ===\n\n\n==== Capital punishment ====\n\nOn March 13, 2019, three years after voters narrowly rejected its repeal, Newsom declared a moratorium on the state's death penalty, preventing any execution in the state as long as he remained governor. The move also led to the withdrawal of the state's current lethal injection protocol and the execution chamber's closure at San Quentin State Prison. In a CBS This Morning interview, Newsom said that the death penalty is \"a racist system ... that is perpetuating inequality. It's a system that I cannot in good conscience support.\" The moratorium granted a temporary reprieve for all 737 inmates on California's death row, then the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere.\nIn January 2022, Newsom directed the state to begin dismantling its death row in San Quentin, to be transformed into a \"space for rehabilitation programs\", as all the condemned inmates are moving to other prisons that have maximum security facilities. The state's voters upheld capital punishment in 2012 and 2016, with the latter measure agreeing to move the condemned to other prisons. While a 2021 poll by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times suggested declining support for capital punishment among California's voters, Republican opponents criticized Newsom's moves to halt capital punishment in California as defiance of the will of voters, and capital punishment advocates said they denied closure to murder victims' families.\n\n\n==== Clemency ====\nIn response to the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants with criminal records, Newsom gave heightened consideration to people in this situation. A pardon can eliminate the grounds for deportation of immigrants who would otherwise be legal permanent residents. Pardon requests from people facing deportation are given expedited review by the state Board of Parole Hearings, per a 2018 California law. In his first acts of clemency as governor, Newsom pardoned seven formerly incarcerated people in May 2019, including two Cambodian refugees facing deportation. He pardoned three men who were attempting to avoid being deported to Cambodia or Vietnam in November 2019. They had separately committed crimes when they were each 19 years old. In December 2019, Newsom granted parole to a Cambodian refugee who had been held in a California prison due to a murder case. Although immigrant rights groups wanted Newsom to end policies allowing the transfer to federal agents, the refugee was turned over for possible deportation upon release.\nOn January 13, 2022, Newsom denied parole to Sirhan Sirhan, Robert F. Kennedy's assassin, who had been recommended for parole by a parole board after serving 53 years in prison. Newsom wrote an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times saying Sirhan \"still lacks the insight that would prevent him from making the kind of dangerous and destructive decisions he made in the past. The most glaring proof of Sirhan's deficient insight is his shifting narrative about his assassination of Kennedy, and his current refusal to accept responsibility for it.\"\n\n\n==== Police reform ====\nNewsom has spoken in favor of Assembly Bill 1196, which would ban carotid artery restraints and choke holds in California. He has claimed that there is no longer a place for a policing tactic \"that literally is designed to stop people's blood from flowing into their brain, that has no place any longer in 21st-century practices.\"\nIn September 2021, Newsom signed legislation raising the minimum age to become a police officer from 18 to 21. Also in the bills were restrictions on the use of tear gas and a ban on police departments employing officers after misconduct or crimes. Among the bills was the George Floyd Bill, requiring officers to intervene when witnessing excessive force on the part of another officer.\n\n\n==== Transgender prisoners ====\nIn September 2020, Newsom signed into law a bill allowing California transgender inmates to be placed in prisons that correspond with their gender identity. An inmate's request can be denied based on \"management or security concerns\". In response, the Women's Liberation Front filed a lawsuit claiming that the bill is \"unconstitutional and creates an unsafe environment for women in female facilities\".\n\n\n=== Disasters and emergencies ===\n\n\n==== COVID-19 pandemic ====\n\nNewsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020, after the first death in California attributable to the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). His stated intention was to help California prepare for and contain COVID-19's spread. The emergency declaration allowed state agencies to more easily procure equipment and services, share information on patients and alleviated restrictions on the use of state-owned properties and facilities. Newsom also announced that mitigation policies for the state's estimated 108,000 unsheltered homeless people would be prioritized, with a significant push to move them indoors.\nNewsom issued an executive order that allowed the state to commandeer hotels and medical facilities to treat COVID-19 patients and permitted government officials to hold teleconferences in private without violating open meeting laws. He also directed local school districts to make their own decisions on school closures, but used an executive order to ensure students' needs would be met whether or not their school was physically open. The U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the Newsom administration's request to offer meal service during school closures, which included families being able to pick up those meals at libraries, parks, or other off-campus locations. Roughly 80% of students at California's public schools receive free or reduced-price meals. This executive order included continued funding for remote learning opportunities and child care options during workday hours.\nAs the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state continued to rise, on March 15, Newsom urged people 65 and older and those with chronic health conditions to isolate themselves from others. He also called on bars and brewery and winery tasting rooms to close their doors to patrons. Some local jurisdictions had mandatory closures. The closures were extended to movie theaters and health clubs. He asked restaurants to stop serving meals inside their establishments and offer take-out meals only. His statewide order to stay at home became mandatory on March 19. It allowed movement outside the home for necessities or recreation, but people were required to maintain a safe distance apart. Activity \"needed to maintain continuity of operation of the federal critical infrastructure sectors, critical government services, schools, childcare, and construction\" was excluded from the order. Essential services such as grocery stores and pharmacies remained open. Newsom provided state funds to pay for protective measures such as hotel room lodging for hospital and other essential workers fearing returning home and infecting family members. By April 26, he had issued 30 executive orders under the state of emergency while the legislature had not been in session.\nOn April 28, Newsom, along with the governors of Oregon and Washington, announced a \"shared approach\" for reopening their economies. His administration outlined key indicators for altering his stay-at-home mandate, including the ability to closely monitor and track potential cases, prevent infection of high-risk people, increase surge capacity at hospitals, develop therapeutics, ensure physical distancing at schools, businesses, and child-care facilities, and develop guidelines for restoring isolation orders if the virus surges. The plan to end the shutdown had four phases. Newsom emphasized that easing restrictions would be based on data, not dates, saying, \"We will base reopening plans on facts and data, not on ideology. Not what we want. Not what we hope.\" Of a return of Major League Baseball and the NFL, he said, \"I would move very cautiously in that expectation.\"\nIn early May, Newsom announced that certain retailers could reopen for pickup. Most Californians approved of Newsom's handling of the crisis and were more concerned about reopening too early than too late, but there were demonstrations and protests against these policies. Under pressure, Newsom delegated more decision-making on reopening to the local level. That same month, he announced a plan for registered voters to have the option to vote by mail in the November election. California was the first state in the country to commit to sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters for the November general election.\nAs the state opened up, the Los Angeles Times found that new coronavirus hospitalizations in California began accelerating around June 15 at a rate not seen since early April, immediately after the virus began rapidly spreading in the state. On June 18, Newsom made face coverings mandatory for all Californians in an effort to reduce COVID-19's spread. Enforcement would be up to business owners, as local law enforcement agencies view non-compliance as a minor infraction. By the end of June, he had ordered seven counties to close bars and nightspots, and recommended eight other counties take action on their own to close those businesses due to a surge of coronavirus cases in some parts of the state. In a regular press conference on July 13 as he was ordering the reinstatement of the shutdown of bars and indoor dining in restaurants, he said, \"We're seeing an increase in the spread of the virus, so that's why it's incumbent upon all of us to recognize soberly that COVID-19 is not going away any time soon until there is a vaccine or an effective therapy\".\nNewsom oversaw a sluggish initial rollout of vaccines; California had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country by January 2021, and had only used about 30% of the vaccines it had at its disposal, a far lower rate than other states, by January 20. Newsom had an approval rating of 64% in September 2020, but a February 2021 UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll found that his approval rate was down to 46%, with 48% disapproval, the highest of his tenure. The Los Angeles Times attributed this decline to public opinion of his management of the pandemic. The vaccination rate began increasing in January, with over half the population fully vaccinated as of September 2021, the percentage ranking #16 out of the 50 states.\nAlthough the Newsom administration enacted some of the country's most stringent pandemic restrictions in 2020, California had the 29th-highest death rate of all 50 states by May 2021. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at UCSF, said that California's restrictive approach \"did not lead to better health outcomes\", and criticized California's delay in implementing new CDC recommendations absolving the fully vaccinated from most indoor mask requirements, while saying the decision lacked scientific rationale and could cause \"collateral damage\".\n\n\n==== Pandemic unemployment fraud and debt ====\nIn January 2021, the Los Angeles Times reported that Newsom's administration had mismanaged $11.4 billion by disbursing unemployment benefits to ineligible claimants, especially those paid through the federally funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. Another $19 billion in claims remained under investigation for fraud. At the same time, legitimate claimants faced lengthy delays in receiving benefits. The state's unemployment system had been overseen by California Labor Secretary Julie Su, a Newsom appointee, whom President Joe Biden later appointed as deputy secretary of labor in February 2021.\nPolitical opponents attributed the crisis to the Newsom administration's failure to heed multiple warnings by federal officials of the potential for fraud, while Newsom's administration said the Trump administration's failure to provide appropriate guidance for the new federally funded program contributed to the fraud. Experts said much of the fraud appeared to originate from international criminal gangs in 20 countries. A report by California State Auditor Elaine Howle said $810 million was disbursed to claimants who had fraudulently filed on behalf of inmates in the state's prison system.\nAccording to The Sacramento Bee, by the summer of 2021, California owed $23 billion to the federal government for unemployment benefits paid out during the pandemic, which was 43% of all unemployment debt, owed by 13 states at the time, to the federal government. Most of this debt was unrelated to the federally funded pandemic unemployment programs that had experienced most of the fraud, and instead was due to longstanding underfunding and California's high rate of unemployment during the pandemic.\n\n\n==== Wildfires ====\n\nDue to a mass die-off of trees throughout California that could increase the risk of wildfires, Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 22, 2020, in preparation for the 2020 wildfire season. After declaring a state of emergency on August 18, he reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16–17. His request for assistance via issuance of a federal disaster declaration in the wake of six major wildfires was first rejected by the Trump administration, but accepted after Trump spoke to Newsom.\nOn June 23, 2021, the NPR station CapRadio reported that Newsom and Cal Fire had falsely claimed in January 2020 that 90,000 acres (36,000 ha) of land at risk for wildfires had been treated with fuel breaks and prescribed burns; the actual treated area was 11,399 acres (4,613 ha), an overstatement of 690%. According to CapRadio, the fuel breaks of the 35 \"priority projects\" Newsom had touted, which were meant to ensure the quick evacuation of residents while preventing traffic jams and a repeat of events in the 2018 fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, where at least eight evacuees burned to death in their vehicles, were struggling to mitigate fire spread in almost every instance while failing to prevent evacuation traffic jams. The same day CapRadio revealed the oversight, leaked emails showed that Newsom's handpicked Cal Fire chief had ordered the removal of the original statement. In another report in April 2022, CapRadio found a program, hailed in 2020 by the Newsom administration to fast-track environmental reviews on high-priority fire prevention projects, had failed to make progress.\nKXTV released a series of reports chronicling PG&E's liabilities after committing 91 felonies in the Santa Rosa and Paradise fires. Newsom was accused of accepting campaign donations from PG&E in order to change the CPUC's ruling on PG&E's safety license. The rating change allowed PG&E to avoid billions of dollars in extra fees. Newsom was also accused of setting up the Wildfire Insurance Fund via AB 1054, using ratepayer fees, so PG&E could avoid financial losses and pass the liability costs to ratepayers and taxpayers.\n\n\n==== June 2025 Los Angeles protests ====\n\nIn June 2025, protests broke out in Los Angeles after a series of federal immigration raids. As demonstrations continued, President Trump issued a memorandum federalizing up to 4,000 California National Guard troops and deploying U.S. Marines to assist with the response. Newsom objected, calling it an unconstitutional overreach of federal authority. On June 9, the State of California, led by Newsom, filed a federal lawsuit, Newsom v. Trump, challenging the legality of the troop deployment. The complaint argued that the order exceeded the president's statutory powers under 10 U.S.C. § 252 and violated the Tenth Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\n\n=== Energy and environment ===\n\nUpon taking office in 2019, Newsom succeeded Brown as co-chair of the United States Climate Alliance. In September 2019, Newsom vetoed SB 1, which would have preserved environmental protections at the state level that were set to roll back nationally under the Trump administration's environmental policy. In February 2020, the Newsom administration sued federal agencies over the rollbacks to protect imperiled fish in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta in 2019.\nNewsom attended the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, where he spoke of California as a climate leader due to the actions of governors before him. In August 2020, he addressed the 2020 Democratic National Convention. His speech mentioned climate change and the wildfires prevalent in California at the time. On September 23, 2020, Newsom signed an executive order to phase out sales of gasoline-powered vehicles and require all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035. Bills he signed in September with an environmental focus included a commission to study lithium extraction around the Salton Sea.\nDuring his 2018 campaign, Newsom pledged to tighten state oversight of fracking and oil extraction. Early in his governorship, his administration approved new oil and gas leases on public lands at about twice the rate of the prior year. When asked about this development, Newsom said he was unaware of the rate of approvals, and he later fired the head of the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources. In November 2019, he imposed a moratorium on approval of new hydraulic fracturing and steam-injected oil drilling in the state until the permits for those projects could be reviewed by an independent panel of scientists. State agencies resumed issuing new hydraulic fracturing permits in April 2020. In 2021, the Center for Biological Diversity sued the Newsom administration over the continued sale of oil and gas leases, and Consumer Watchdog called for the end of their sale. In April 2021, Newsom committed to ending the sale of gas leases by 2024 and ending oil extraction by 2045. In October 2021, he proposed a 3,200-foot (980 m) buffer between new fossil fuel extraction sites and densely populated areas.\nIn 2022, gas prices in California exceeded $6 per gallon. Newsom attributed this to corporate greed and price gouging by oil companies. He proposed a windfall profits tax and penalty for oil companies in September 2022. On March 28, 2023, Newsom signed a law that authorizes the California Energy Commission to set \"a profit threshold above which companies would be assessed a financial penalty\", requires petroleum companies to report additional profit data to state regulators, and creates a new oversight division of the California Energy Commission to investigate price gouging in the gasoline industry.\n\n\n=== Animal welfare ===\nIn 2019, Newsom signed a package of legislation aimed at curtailing animal cruelty and protecting animal welfare. In September 2019, he signed the Wildlife Protection Act, which prohibited commercial and recreational fur trapping. In October 2019, he signed legislation prohibiting the manufacture and sale of new fur products in California, as well as legislation banning bobcat hunting, ending the use of most animals in circuses, and strengthening Proposition 6's prohibition on horse meat and horse slaughter. In September 2022, Newsom signed legislation that banned animal testing of pesticides and other chemical substances on dogs and cats. California's fur sales ban became effective in 2023, making California the first state to ban new fur sales.\nIn September 2024, Newsom signed legislation supported by animal rights and environmental activists prohibiting the commercial farming of octopuses in California. The law states that octopuses are \"highly intelligent, curious, problem-solving animals\" that are capable of feeling pain. California was the second state to ban octopus farming after Washington enacted a ban in March 2024.\nIn July 2025, the Department of Justice named the state of California, Newsom, and other California public officials in a lawsuit targeting the state's regulations against intensive battery cage eggs, including Proposition 2 and Proposition 12. Newsom's office responded that the Trump administration enjoys \"blaming California for literally everything\".\n\n\n=== Ethics concerns ===\n\n\n==== Donations to spouse's nonprofit organization ====\nThe Sacramento Bee reported that Jennifer Siebel Newsom's nonprofit organization The Representation Project had received more than $800,000 in donations from corporations that had lobbied the state government in recent years, including PG&E, AT&T, Comcast, and Kaiser Permanente. Siebel Newsom received $2.3 million in salary from the nonprofit since launching it in 2011. In 2021, Governor Newsom said that he saw no conflict in his wife's nonprofit accepting donations from companies that lobby his administration.\n\n\n==== Donations to campaign ====\nIn February 2024, Bloomberg News reported that Newsom pushed for an exemption for businesses that bake and sell bread in AB 1228, a bill that raises the state's minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 per hour. The exemption included 24 Panera Bread bakery-cafes owned by Greg Flynn, a businessman who donated $100,000 and $64,800 to Newsom's campaigns over the years. Republican lawmakers called for an investigation into the unusual exemption. When reporters asked him about the exemption, Newsom said: \"That's a part of the sausage making. We went back and forth, and that was part of the negotiation. That's the nature of negotiation ... That was all part of the give and take and that was the collective wisdom of the legislature and ultimately led to my signature.\"\nIn September 2024, the Los Angeles Times reported that Newsom had signed AB 3206 into law, carving out an exception to the state's last call alcohol law for one specific venue, Intuit Dome, owned by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Ballmer's wife, Connie Ballmer, donated $1 million to the Newsom campaign in 2021. Ethics experts criticized the bill for exclusively benefiting a major donor to Newsom. \"It's certainly going to become an issue for his opponents and critics to point to the fact that he seemed to provide a special favor to a wealthy sports franchise owner and its facility and its wealthy fans. It just doesn't look good\", said John Pelissero, director of government ethics at Santa Clara University. A spokesperson for Newsom said, \"The governor's decisions on legislation are made solely on the merits of each bill.\"\n\n\n=== Executive authority and actions ===\nOverall, Newsom has vetoed legislation at a rate comparable to that of his predecessors. From 2019 to 2021, he vetoed 12.7% of the bills the legislature passed on average. The rate declined over the course of the three legislative sessions. Newsom's vetoes have included bills to allow ranked-choice voting, require an ethnic studies class as a high school graduation requirement, regulate AI, and reduce penalties for jaywalking.\nNewsom used a larger than normal number of executive orders during the 2020 legislative session.\n\n\n=== Gun control ===\n\nAs lieutenant governor in 2016, Newsom was the official proponent of Proposition 63. The ballot measure required a background check and California Department of Justice authorization to purchase ammunition, among other gun control regulations. In response to the 2019 mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Newsom called for nationwide background checks on people purchasing ammunition. Later that year, he responded to the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting by stating his support for the Second Amendment and saying he would like national cooperation controlling \"weapons of goddamned mass destruction\". He also said, \"These shootings overwhelmingly, almost exclusively, are males, boys, 'men'—I put in loose quotes. I do think that is missing in the national conversation.\"\nOn June 10, 2021, Newsom called federal Judge Roger Benitez \"a stone cold ideologue\" and \"a wholly owned subsidiary of the gun lobby of the National Rifle Association\" after Benitez struck down California's statewide ban on assault weapons. While the ban remained in place as the state appealed the ruling, Newsom proposed legislation that would empower private citizens to enforce the ban after the United States Supreme Court declined to strike down the Texas Heartbeat Act, which empowers private citizens to report unauthorized abortions.\nIn 2022, Newsom signed gun control bills passed by the California Legislature. On July 1, he signed Assembly Bill 1621, which restricts privately made firearms, which were found to be linked to over 100 violent crimes in Los Angeles, and Assembly Bill 2571, which prohibited the marketing of firearms such as the JR-15 to children. On July 22, Newsom signed Senate Bill 1327, a law enabling private citizens to sue anyone who imports, distributes, manufactures or sells illegal firearms in California. The law requires courts to award statutory damages of at least $10,000 and attorney's fees.\nOn June 8, 2023, Newsom proposed a 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution to raise the age to buy firearms to 21, institute universal background checks for gun purchases, mandate waiting periods and ban assault weapons for civilians. Law professor Erwin Chemerinsky called this a \"terrible idea\", since the advocated method (which has never been used) would be a constitutional convention (which is not understood to be limited to single amendments), potentially allowing a complete rewrite of the Constitution, or addition of other amendments on separate subjects, like abortion, or the often proposed balanced budget amendment (which liberals feel would decimate welfare programs).\n\n\n=== Abortion ===\n\nIn December 2021, Newsom announced his intention to make California a \"sanctuary\" for abortion, which included possibly paying for procedures, travel, and lodging for out-of-state abortion seekers, if the procedure is banned in Republican-led states. In March 2022, he signed a bill requiring private health insurance plans in the state to fully cover abortion procedures by eliminating associated co-pays and deductibles and increasing insurance premiums. In February 2023, Newsom organized the Reproductive Freedom Alliance of state governors supportive of abortion and reproductive rights.\nAfter Walgreens announced in March 2023 that it would refuse to dispense abortion pills in the 21 states where it is illegal, Newsom tweeted, \"California won't be doing business with @walgreens – or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women's lives at risk, we're done.\" He also said that Walgreens was giving in to \"right-wing bullies\" and that he would determine how California can cut ties with Walgreens. He indicated that he wanted to cancel Walgreens' $54 million contract with the California state prison system. Walgreens also receives $1.5 billion for filling prescriptions for the 15 million people enrolled in the state's Medi-Cal program (California's version of Medicaid). Legal experts said that federal Medicaid laws do not allow health plans to disqualify providers for reasons other than fraud or contract violations, provisions that have prevented conservative states from blocking Medicaid spending to Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\n\nNewsom campaigned on reducing the cost of health care and increasing access. He also indicated his support for creating a universal state health-care system. The budget passed in June 2019 expanded eligibility for Medi-Cal from solely undocumented minor children to undocumented young adults from ages 19 to 25. In 2021, Newsom signed legislation expanding Medi-Cal eligibility to undocumented residents over age 50. On June 30, 2022, he signed a $307.9 billion state budget that \"pledges to make all low-income adults eligible for the state's Medicaid program by 2024 regardless of their immigration status.\" This budget would make California the first U.S. state to guarantee healthcare to all low-income undocumented immigrants, at a cost of $2.7 billion per year.\nNewsom was criticized in early 2022 for walking back from his support for universal health care and not supporting CalCare, Assembly Bill 1400, which would have instituted single-payer healthcare in California; critics suggested that opposition from business interests, which had donated large sums to Newsom and his party, had swayed his opinion.\nOn July 6, 2022, Newsom signed Senate Bill 184, which established the Office of Health Care Affordability, with the stated goal to \"develop data-informed policies and enforceable cost targets, with the ultimate goal of containing health care costs.\"\nIn October 2023, Newsom vetoed a bill to cap co-pays for insulin at $35.\nIn 2025, Newsom signed a budget which restricts new enrollment of undocumented immigrants in Medi-Cal.\n\n\n=== Infrastructure and development ===\n\n\n==== High-speed rail ====\n\nIn his February 2019 State of the State address, Newsom announced that, while work would continue on the 171-mile (275 km) Central Valley segment from Bakersfield to Merced, the rest of the system would be indefinitely postponed, citing cost overruns and delays. This and other actions created tension with the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, a labor union representing 450,000 members.\n\n\n==== Homelessness and housing shortage ====\n\nA poll found that California voters thought the most important issue for Newsom and the state legislature to work on in 2020 was homelessness. In his first week of office, Newsom threatened to withhold state funding for infrastructure to communities that failed to take actions to alleviate California's housing shortage. In late January 2019, he announced that he would sue Huntington Beach for preventing the construction of affordable housing. A year later, the city acted to settle the lawsuit by the state. Newsom opposes NIMBY (not-in-my-back-yard) sentiment, declaring in 2022 that \"NIMBYism is destroying the state\". In 2021, he signed a pair of bills into law that made zoning regulations for housing less restrictive, allowing construction of duplexes and fourplexes in lots that were previously zoned exclusively for single-family homes. Newsom also signed a bill which expedites the environmental review process for new multifamily developments worth at least $15,000,000. To participate, developers must apply directly through the governor's office.\nIn 2022, Newsom signed 39 bills into law intended to address California's housing crisis, three of which entailed major land use reform. One bill eliminated minimum parking requirements for housing near mass transit stations throughout the state. Michael Manville, an urban planning professor at UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs, called it \"one of the biggest land-use reforms in the country.\" Another bill allowed developers to build housing on some lots previously exclusively zoned for commercial use without getting local governments' permission if a certain percentage of the housing was affordable. A third bill allowed for the construction of market-rate housing on some lots previously exclusively zoned for commercial use. In a signing ceremony for the latter two bills, Newsom warned local governments, which have a history of blocking and delaying housing developments, that they would be held accountable for future housing obstructionism. Other bills Newsom signed required localities \"to approve or deny various building permits within a strict timeline\" and streamlined student and faculty housing projects by allowing California colleges to skip onerous review processes for new projects. Measures and actions to reduce homelessness in California have not yet solved the problem. The number of homeless hit a record number of over 181,000 in January 2023. According to some, to cope with this problem, California must build more than 2.5 million housing units.\nIn October 2023, Newsom vetoed several bills aimed at expanding access to housing assistance. One was a bill to repurpose unused state-owned land for affordable housing, which Newsom said infringed on state sovereignty. Another would have expanded the number of people who qualify for state housing assistance. A third would have mandated that Medi-Cal cover the cost of housing assistance.\n\nIn August 2024, Newsom warned counties that did not remove their homeless encampments that failure to do so would result in their state funding being cut off the next year. He issued this warning after personally visiting and clearing out a Los Angeles homeless encampment without notifying the city beforehand.\n\n\n==== Water management ====\n\nNewsom supports a series of tentative water-sharing agreements that would bring an end to the dispute between farmers, cities, fishers, and environmentalists over how much water should be left in the state's two most important rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin, which flow into the Delta.\n\n\n=== Native American relations ===\n\nIn a speech before representatives of Native Americans in June 2019, Newsom apologized for the genocide of Native Americans approved and abetted by the California state government upon statehood in the 19th century. By one estimate, at least 4,500 Native Californians were killed between 1849 and 1870. Newsom said, \"That's what it was, a genocide. No other way to describe it. And that's the way it needs to be described in the history books.\" In October 2024, Newsom signed AB 3074, the \"California Racial Mascots Act\", which prohibits K-12 schools not run by recognized Native American tribes from using \"derogatory\" names or mascots.\n\n\n=== LGBTQ+ rights ===\n\nIn September 2022, Newsom signed Senate Bill 107 into law, making California the first sanctuary state for transgender youth. He issued an official state proclamation for Pride Month in June 2023, issued a fine of $1.5 million to a school district whose board rejected a curriculum including a biography of gay rights leader Harvey Milk, and signed a bill prohibiting schools from banning textbooks based on their inclusion of references to people from minority groups or the LGBT community. In July 2024, he signed the \"SAFETY Act\", which prohibits schools from outing students' gender identity to their parents without the students' consent.\nNewsom vetoed several bills, passed by the Assembly by a wide margin, one of which would have instructed judges who preside over custody battles to take a parent's affirmation of a child's gender identity into account, and another of which would have mandated that insurance plans serving California residents cover the cost of gender-affirming care.\n\n\n=== Caste discrimination ===\nIn October 2023, Newsom vetoed a bill to ban discrimination based on caste, calling it \"unnecessary\" and adding that California \"already prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other characteristics, and state law specifies that these civil rights protections shall be liberally construed.\" Many Hindu rights organizations applauded the veto, saying the bill \"would have put a target on hundreds of thousands of Californians simply because of their ethnicity or their religious identity\". Advocates for the rights of Dalits and other marginalized castes sharply criticized the veto.\n\n\n=== Labor rights ===\nIn October 2023, Newsom vetoed a bill to provide unemployment insurance to striking workers, citing excess burden on the state's unemployment system. He also vetoed a bill to expand the mandatory warning given to soon to be laid off employees from 60 days to 75, extend the same protections to long-term contract workers, and prohibit employers from making laid-off employees sign nondisclosure agreements in order to receive severance.\nIn 2024, Newsom vetoed SB 1299 which \"would have required workers’ comp judges to presume farmworkers who claim heat illness developed it at work\"\n\n\n=== International travel ===\n\nNewsom's first international trip as governor was to El Salvador. With nearly 680,000 Salvadoran immigrants living in California, he said that the \"state's relationship with Central America is key to California's future\". He was also concerned about the tens of thousands of Salvadorans who were fleeing the smallest country in Central America for the U.S. each year. As governor of a state impacted by the debate of illegal immigration, he went to see the factors driving it firsthand, and to build business and tourism partnerships between California and Central America. He said he wanted to \"ignite a more enlightened engagement and dialogue\".\nOn October 20, 2023, Newsom visited Israel to express solidarity with the country during the Gaza war. He met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli president Isaac Herzog, other top Israeli officials, and survivors of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.\nIn October 2023, Newsom embarked on a week-long visit to China. It began in Hong Kong, where he attended a discussion at the University of Hong Kong about climate change. He then traveled to Beijing, where he met with Chinese president Xi Jinping, discussing issues including climate change, trade relations, and the response to fentanyl production. Chinese officials reportedly physically blocked American media members from attending the meeting while allowing access to Chinese reporters. The visit also included stops in Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shanghai. Newsom called for better relations between the U.S. and China during the trip, saying that \"divorce is not an option\" for the two countries. The trip drew criticism from a coalition of 50 U.S.-based pro-democracy and human rights organizations, which issued a joint statement that attacked it for sidelining human rights concerns. Ahead of Newsom's trip to China, a spokesperson for his administration said the visit would focus on climate change, not human rights, as the latter was a federal issue.\n\n\n=== 2025 California Proposition 50 ===\n\nIn August 2025, Newsom secured legislative approval of California Proposition 50. In November, voters will vote on a state constitutional amendment to allow congressional redistricting. The goal is to switch seats from Republican to Democratic control. It is a response to Texas's decision to redistrict its congressional map to add five new Republican seats.\n\n\n=== National profile and political future ===\n\nMany journalists and political analysts have mentioned Newsom as a presidential hopeful. According to a June 2023 poll by NewsNation, 22% of California voters wanted Newsom to enter the 2024 presidential election. In May 2023, Schwarzenegger said it was a \"no-brainer\" that Newsom would someday run for president. An April 2023 article published in The Hill by journalist Sharon Udasin also discussed the inevitability of a Newsom presidential run. In September 2022, Newsom said that he would not run for president in 2024, citing his \"vulnerable\" 2021 recall. After his 2022 reelection, he informed White House staff that he would not challenge President Biden in the Democratic primaries; he endorsed Biden's reelection campaign on April 25, 2023.\nNewsom has become an outspoken critic of the policies of Florida governor Ron DeSantis, denouncing DeSantis's orchestration of the Martha's Vineyard migrant airlift. DeSantis responded by saying California has \"huge problems\" and dared Newsom to run against Biden. In November 2023, the two debated, with Fox News's Sean Hannity as moderator.\nIn July 2024, Newsom launched a podcast, Politickin', co-hosted by Marshawn Lynch and Doug Hendrickson. After Biden's sudden withdrawal from the presidential race that month, Newsom said he would not seek the Democratic nomination, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\nAfter Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Newsom called for California lawmakers to convene later in 2024 to safeguard California's policies from the upcoming Trump administration.\nIn December 2024, Newsom criticized Biden for pardoning his son Hunter Biden. He said, \"I'm disappointed and can't support the decision.\"\nIn anticipation of a potential 2028 presidential campaign, Newsom has adjusted his political approach to appeal to a broader electorate. A key shift in his strategy has been his engagement with conservative voices, including hosting MAGA figures like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on his podcast, This is Gavin Newsom. While this tactic has received a fair amount of criticism from his own supporters, Newsom has also been praised by figures on the left for his hawkish response to the Trump administration's actions regarding gerrymandering, with his widely publicized Election Rigging Response Act in August 2025 seen by many commentators as a soft launch of a presidential run. In August 2025, Newsom started communicating on social media platforms in a style intended to mimic President Trump's communications.\n\n\n== Other political activism ==\nIn 2023, Newsom launched Campaign for Democracy, a PAC to take on \"authoritarian leaders\" in the U.S. It is thought to be a starting point for a possible 2028 presidential bid.\nAs of July 2024, Campaign for Democracy has raised $24 million for direct contributions to candidates and other spending. The group is not subject to contribution limits, but it can coordinate with Newsom as long as he is not a candidate for federal office.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nNewsom was baptized and raised in his father's Catholic faith. In 2008, he described himself as an \"Irish Catholic rebel ... in some respects, but one that still has tremendous admiration for the Church and very strong faith\"; when asked about the state of the Catholic Church, Newsom said it was in crisis. He said he stays with the Church because of his \"strong connection to a greater purpose, and to sort of a higher being\". Newsom identifies as a practicing Catholic, saying in 2008 that he has a \"strong sense of faith that is perennial, day in and day out\".\nIn December 2001, Newsom married legal commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle at Saint Ignatius Catholic Church. They separated in 2004 and jointly filed for divorce in January 2005, citing \"difficulties due to their careers on opposite coasts\". Their divorce was finalized on February 28, 2006, by which time Guilfoyle was expecting a child with Eric Villency. Guilfoyle gained prominence in 2011 via a Fox News chat show. She was later named senior advisor to Republican president Donald Trump, whom Newsom has extensively criticized, and was later engaged to Donald Trump Jr.\nIn September 2006, Newsom, then 38, briefly dated 19-year-old Brittanie Mountz, a model and restaurant hostess. On January 31, 2007, Newsom's close friend, campaign manager, and former chief of staff Alex Tourk confronted him after learning from his wife, Ruby Rippey-Tourk, that she and Newsom had an affair in 2005, when she was Newsom's appointments secretary. Tourk immediately resigned. Newsom admitted to the affair the next day and apologized to the public, saying he was \"deeply sorry\" for his \"personal lapse of judgment\". In 2018, Rippey-Tourk said that she thought it wrong to associate Newsom's behavior with the #MeToo movement: \"I was a subordinate, but I was also a free-thinking, 33-yr old adult married woman and mother. I do want to make sure that the #metoo movement is reserved for cases and situations that deserve it.\"\nNewsom began dating film director Jennifer Siebel in October 2006. He announced he would seek treatment for alcohol use disorder in February 2007. The couple announced their engagement in December 2007, and they were married in Stevensville, Montana, in July 2008. They have four children.\nAfter he completed service as mayor of San Francisco in 2011, Newsom and his family moved to a house they bought in Kentfield in Marin County in 2012. After his election as governor, Newsom and his family moved into the California Governor's Mansion in Downtown Sacramento and thereafter settled in Fair Oaks. In May 2019, The Sacramento Bee reported that Newsom's $3.7 million purchase of a 12,000-square-foot home in Fair Oaks was the most expensive private residence sold in the Sacramento region since the year began.\nIn August 2021, Newsom sold the Marin County home for $5.9 million in an off-market transaction. He had originally put the property up for sale in early 2019 for $5.895 million, but removed the property from the market after a price reduction to $5.695 million.\nNewsom is the godfather of designer, model, and LGBTQ rights activist Nats Getty. According to James Reginato's Growing Up Getty, the Newsoms, Harrises, Pelosis, and Gettys are godparents to one another's children and make appearances at important family events.\n\n\n== Works ==\nGavin Newsom (2013; co-authored with Lisa Dickey).

        "title": "28 Years Later",
        "content": "28 Years Later is a 2025 post-apocalyptic coming-of-age horror film produced and directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. The third instalment  in the 28 Days Later film series, following 28 Days Later (2002) and 28 Weeks Later (2007), it stars Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Alfie Williams in his feature film debut, and Ralph Fiennes. \nPlans for a third film began shortly after the release of 28 Weeks Later. The project had numerous delays over the years regarding conflicts over the franchise film rights, stalling it into development hell. It gained traction in 2024, when series producer Andrew Macdonald bought the rights to the first film back from Searchlight Pictures, which he then sold to Sony Pictures on the provision the studio agreed to fund sequels. 28 Years Later marks the returns of Boyle, Garland and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle to the series, all of whom worked on the first film, with original star Cillian Murphy also serving as executive producer. It was shot back-to-back with its sequel 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, set to be released in January 2026.\n28 Years Later was released in the United Kingdom and the United States by Columbia Pictures through Sony Pictures Releasing on 20 June 2025. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $150.4 million worldwide against its budget of $60 million.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2002, during the initial outbreak of the Rage virus, a young boy named Jimmy Crystal flees his house in the Scottish Highlands as his family are attacked by the infected. He takes refuge in the local church with his father, a minister, but finds him praying in ecstasy, since he interprets the virus as a harbinger of the end times and the Day of Judgement. Jimmy's father bequeaths him a cross necklace and helps him to safety before submitting to the infected as they break in.\nTwenty-eight years after its second outbreak, the Rage virus has been eradicated from continental Europe, while the British Isles remain under indefinite quarantine with few survivors. A civilised community has subsisted on the holy island of Lindisfarne, defended naturally from Great Britain by a causeway that floods with the tide. Among them are Jamie, a scavenger, his wife, Isla, who has an unknown, mentally debilitating illness, and their 12-year-old son, Spike. Jamie and Spike cross to mainland Britain for a coming-of-age hunting ritual.\nOn the mainland, the pair find an infected tied up and branded with the name \"Jimmy\", and they encounter a large pack of infected led by an \"Alpha\", an evolved infected that is stronger and more intelligent. They are forced into taking shelter overnight in the attic of a run-down cottage, where Spike observes foreign boats on quarantine patrol and a fire further inland. When the attic suddenly collapses, the Alpha pursues Jamie and Spike across the partially inundated causeway until the village sentries kill it with a ballista.\nThe village throws a party for Spike to celebrate his first kill. Spike becomes upset at Jamie's embellishment of their trip and leaves, discovering Jamie's affair with Rosie, the village schoolteacher. Back at home, he discusses the fire with family friend Sam, who reveals the existence of Dr Ian Kelson, a former GP in exile. The next morning, Spike confronts Jamie over his unwillingness to seek medical care for Isla and his infidelity. Jamie insists that Kelson, whom he once witnessed burning corpses in an apparently ritualistic manner, is too mentally unstable to help. Unconvinced, Spike escapes the island with Isla. \nThe next day, Spike and Isla are rescued from a pack of infected by Swedish Navy seaman Erik Sundqvist, the sole survivor from a stranded NATO quarantine patrol boat, who joins their expedition. Isla discovers a pregnant infected and helps it deliver an uninfected baby girl. A paranoid Erik shoots the infected mother and threatens to kill Isla and Spike alongside the newborn if they do not let him kill it, believing it to be infected, but the Alpha father appears and decapitates him. \nDr Kelson appears and subdues the Alpha, whom he has named Samson, with a blowgun and morphine-xylazine dart. Kelson leads the group to a monument he has constructed out of human bones recovered from cremation. He explains the funerary concept of memento mori and incorporates Erik's skull into the monument.\nExamining Isla in the night, Kelson deduces that she has terminal cancer. As Spike struggles with the news, Kelson consoles him, advising him memento amoris – \"remember you must love\". Isla accepts her mortality and arranges her euthanasia, after which Kelson gives her skull to Spike to stand at the top of the monument.\nWhen Samson infiltrates the sanctuary, Spike fends him off, saving Kelson's life. Kelson encourages Spike to go home with the infant. Instead, Spike leaves her at the village gate and returns to the mainland, still disillusioned. Jamie reads a note from Spike that reveals he has named the girl after Isla and promises he will return when he is ready. Jamie tries to follow but is blocked by the rising tide.\nTwenty-eight days later, as Spike is pursued by a pack of infected, he is rescued by a cult styled after tracksuit-wearing Jimmy Savile, and greeted by their leader, an adult Jimmy, with his now-inverted cross necklace.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nAlfie Williams as Spike, Jamie and Isla's 12-year-old son\nJodie Comer as Isla, Jamie's wife who is battling a mysterious illness\nAaron Taylor-Johnson as Jamie, a scavenger and Isla's husband\nRalph Fiennes as Dr Ian Kelson, a former doctor and survivor of the outbreak\nEdvin Ryding as Erik Sundqvist, a Swedish soldier\nChi Lewis-Parry as \"Samson\", a physically imposing Alpha leader of the infected\nChristopher Fulford as Sam, a friend of Jamie's and a resident on the island\nStella Gonet as Jenny, a member of the island's leadership council\nJack O'Connell as Sir Jimmy Crystal, the leader of the Jimmy Savile-inspired \"Jimmy\" cult and a survivor of the original outbreak\nRocco Haynes as Young Jimmy Crystal\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn June 2007, Fox Atomic confirmed development on a third 28 Days Later film, dependent upon the financial performance of 28 Weeks Later following its home video release. In July of the same year, Danny Boyle said that the story for a third instalment had been mapped out. By October 2010, Alex Garland stated that due to differences involving the film rights, the project had been delayed. In January 2011, Boyle stated that he believed the project would be realised, confirming further developments for the story. By April 2013, however, the filmmaker expressed uncertainty as to whether the movie would be made. In January 2015, Garland addressed the project's status, confirming that while it had fallen into development hell there were serious discussions going on behind the scenes to produce the project. Reiterating that development was progressing, he stated that the script he was working on was tentatively titled 28 Months Later. In June 2019, Boyle confirmed that he and Garland had been working on the third instalment. In March 2020, Imogen Poots expressed interest in reprising her role from 28 Weeks Later, followed by Cillian Murphy in May 2021.\nIn November 2022, Boyle, Garland and Murphy all indicated their interest in making a sequel to 28 Days Later. In June 2023, Boyle and Garland expressed in collaboration their intentions to \"seriously\" and \"diligently\" see the project enter production; while announcing that the script was now titled 28 Years Later, acknowledging the years it had taken to be developed. Boyle stated that he would like to serve as director, unless Garland chooses to. By July of the same year, Murphy stated that he had recently discussed the possibility of a third film with Boyle; once again expressing interest in reprising his role if Boyle and Garland return to the franchise in their creative roles.\nIn January 2024, it was announced that a third film titled 28 Years Later was officially in development; with plans for the project to be the first of a new trilogy of sequels. Danny Boyle directed the first instalment, with a script written by Alex Garland; while the latter will also write the scripts for each of the planned sequels. Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, and Peter Rice will serve as producers. In February of the same year, Murphy discussed his potential involvement with the project; that same month, Macdonald had bought back the rights to the first film from Searchlight Pictures, promptly selling it to Sony Pictures for future distribution, as well as rights to future sequels. In March 2024, Garland confirmed that he is writing a trilogy of sequel films. The following month, Garland stated the film Kes was a major influence on his work for 28 Years Later. Murphy was revealed as an executive producer later that month.\nThe film was produced by Columbia Pictures, and DNA Films, with funding support from TSG Entertainment.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn April 2024, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes were cast to star, with Jack O'Connell joining the cast in May. It was initially reported that Cillian Murphy would reprise his role as Jim, but in January 2025 the film's producer Andrew Macdonald confirmed he would not appear, though he remains an executive producer. Erin Kellyman was added to the cast in June 2024.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began on 7 May 2024 in Northumberland, with Anthony Dod Mantle serving as the cinematographer. Filming wrapped on 29 July.\nThe film was primarily shot using an iPhone 15 Pro Max, in addition to action cameras, drones, and other digital and film cameras. The use of small digital cameras harks back to filming the original 28 Days Later using the Canon XL-1 digital camcorder, which was manoeuvrable enough to film the deserted locales within the time limits allowed by officials. The film was shot in a 2.76:1 aspect ratio, reminiscent of productions using Ultra Panavision 70, which was chosen to emphasise the unpredictability of the infected and to heighten tension by compelling viewers to \"keep scanning\" the wide frame. Scenes were shot at 4K resolution at up to 60 frames per-second, and in some scenes the actors performed their own camera work. Some shots employed a bullet time effect, created using a custom-built circular rig equipped with eight to twenty iPhone cameras. This setup also allowed scenes to be filmed from multiple angles simultaneously, giving Boyle greater flexibility during editing. Boyle explained that using iPhones allowed the crew to film with minimal equipment, providing easier access to the rural landscapes of Northumberland while minimising environmental impact and helping to preserve the area's natural appearance. The iPhone's default camera software posed some challenges for filming because its automatic focus tended to prioritise the brightest or most prominent object in the frame rather than the intended point of dramatic focus, requiring manual overrides to achieve the desired cinematic effect.\nFilming mainly took place in the north of England, in the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber regions. Locations include Lindisfarne off the Northumberland Coast, Hexham, Bellingham, Kielder Forest, Rothbury (Northumberland), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and Wear), Waskerley (County Durham), Melsonby, Ripon, Fountains Abbey, Aysgarth Falls, Redmire (North Yorkshire) and Bradford (West Yorkshire). Some scenes were filmed at Plankey Mill Farm, near Langley and Bardon Mill (Northumberland). In addition, some filming took place in Cheddar Gorge in Somerset in South West England.\nAlthough the real Sycamore Gap tree was felled by vandals in 2023, it was digitally reconstructed through visual effects for the film, as within the film's alternate timeline the vandalism is presumed to never have taken place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nIn May 2025, Young Fathers was confirmed in composing the film's soundtrack, succeeding previous composer John Murphy. The soundtrack was released on Milan Records on 20 June 2025.\n\n\n== Release ==\n28 Years Later premiered in a special day-ahead preview on 19 June 2025 at the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle upon Tyne, attended by director Boyle and local actor Williams, as well numerous crew, service providers and extras from across the surrounding Northumberland area who were involved in the location shooting of the film. It was released in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada by Sony Pictures Releasing on 20 June 2025.\n\nThe first trailer was released on 10 December 2024. It features the 1903 poem \"Boots\" by Rudyard Kipling, recited by American actor Taylor Holmes in 1915. The trailer became #1 trending on YouTube, and in 48 hours had over 10 million views. Stuart Heritage, the film critic for The Guardian, particularly noted the use of Holmes's spoken-word recording of \"Boots\" and commented: \"As of now, though, it's just about the most exciting film of 2025. And this is entirely down to its trailer.\" The trailer's viral success led to Sony's decision to re-release the original 28 Days Later film on digital platforms on 18 December 2024.\n28 Years Later was released on digital platforms by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on 29 July 2025 and will be released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on 23 September 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\n28 Years Later grossed $70.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $80 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $150.4 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, 28 Years Later was released alongside Elio, and was expected to gross around $30 million in its opening weekend from 3,444 theatres, with some estimates going as high as $45 million. The film made $14 million on its first day, including $5.8 million from Thursday previews. It ended up debuting to $30 million, finishing second behind holdover How to Train Your Dragon and becoming the highest opening weekend of the franchise.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 378 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"28 Years Later taps into contemporary anxieties with the ferocious urgency of someone infected with Rage Virus, delivering a haunting and visceral thrill ride that defies expectations.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 56 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while 52% of those surveyed PostTrak said they would definitely recommend it.\nRobbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film 5/5 stars, writing, \"Call it Disemb-owell and Pressburger: an unholy hybrid of A Canterbury Tale and Cannibal Holocaust which Boyle was perhaps uniquely placed to pull off, and which stands as his finest film since 2008's Slumdog Millionaire\". Ed Potton of The Times also gave it 5/5 stars, writing, \"The sense of hallucinogenic sweatiness won't be to everyone's taste but [Garland] and Boyle should be applauded for taking such big swings and having the flair and confidence to pull them off. It's an astonishing piece of work.\" Rolling Stone's David Fear wrote, \"Whether it all comes together as a satisfactory whole or is merely a sum-of-parts extension with little more to say is anyone's guess. Taken on its own, however, Boyle and Garland's trip back to this hellscape makes the most of casting a jaundiced, bloodshot eye at our current moment.\"\nThe Independent's Clarisse Loughrey gave it 3/5 stars, describing it as \"a post-Brexit, COVID-19-conscious take on this world, with ideas about nationalism, isolationism, and weaponised culture added to the mix. But it's punchy and simple once again.\"\nKyle Smith of The Wall Street Journal was more critical, writing, \"Mr. Boyle has made more than his share of memorable films, but he has also delivered some stinkers and unfortunately his new one carries the fragrance of a zombie underarm.\" Adam Graham of The Detroit News gave it a D grade, calling it \"an uneven mix of horror movie gnarliness and human melancholia that never finds even ground or a consistent tone, and may make viewers reel from genre whiplash.\"\nRotten Tomatoes lists the film on its 100 Best Zombie Movies, Ranked by Tomatometer.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Sequel ==\n\nIn April 2024, Nia DaCosta was reportedly in negotiations to direct a sequel to the film, the second part of a planned trilogy, with Boyle, Garland, Macdonald, Rice, and Bernie Bellew attached as producers. In June 2024, via a copyright filing, the title of the film was seemingly revealed to be 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple.\nOn 18 August 2024, during a talk at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, Macdonald confirmed DaCosta would be directing the sequel and said that principal photography was set to begin the following day. Macdonald also talked about potential plans for a third 28 Years Later film, saying \"we hope there is going to be a third part\" and \"there is a trilogy\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films produced back-to-back\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\n28 Years Later at IMDb",

        "title": "Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning",
        "content": "Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning is a 2025 American action spy film directed by Christopher McQuarrie from a screenplay he co-wrote with Erik Jendresen. It is the direct sequel to Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023) and the eighth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The film stars Tom Cruise in his final portrayal of Ethan Hunt, alongside an ensemble cast including Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Henry Czerny, and Angela Bassett. In the film, Hunt and his IMF team continue their mission to prevent the Entity, a rogue AI, from destroying all of humanity.\nIn January 2019, Cruise announced that the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films would be shot back to back with McQuarrie co-writing and directing both films. Plans for the eighth film changed in February 2021, with returning and new cast and crew members being announced soon after, including Lorne Balfe, who composed the score for two other films in the series: Balfe was later replaced by Max Aruj and Alfie Godfrey. Principal photography began in March 2022 but was suspended in July 2023 due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. Production resumed in March 2024 and concluded in November, with filming locations including England, Malta, South Africa and Norway. Originally subtitled Dead Reckoning Part Two, the film changed its subtitle in November 2024. With a $300–400 million budget, The Final Reckoning is one of the most expensive films ever made.\nThe Final Reckoning had its world premiere in Tokyo on May 5, 2025, was screened out of competition at the 78th Cannes Film Festival on May 14, and was theatrically released in the United States on May 23 by Paramount Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $598 million worldwide, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2025, while also having the largest opening weekend of the franchise. It was the last film co-produced by Paramount and Skydance as separate entities before they merged on August 7, 2025.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo months after retrieving the key to the source code for the malevolent artificial intelligence known as the Entity, rogue IMF agent Ethan Hunt receives a message from US President Erika Sloane. She informs Ethan that the Entity continues to seize control of global nuclear systems, aided by undercover doomsday cultists. Ethan is ordered to surrender the key, but he refuses and continues pursuing Gabriel, the Entity's former proxy. He and fellow IMF agent Benji Dunn first visit their ill IMF hacker Luther Stickell in his off-grid lab beneath London, where he has finished developing the \"Poison Pill\" malware that can target the Entity.\nThe team recruits Jasper Briggs's intelligence agent, Theo Degas, and Gabriel's former lieutenant, Paris, who tells them where Gabriel is. In London, Gabriel's men capture Ethan and IMF agent Grace. Gabriel forces Ethan to recover the \"Podkova\" module developed from the \"Rabbit's Foot\" in the sunken Russian submarine Sevastopol, which would give him control over the Entity. Ethan and Grace escape with the team's help. Contacting the Entity, Ethan is shown visions of a nuclear apocalypse. The Entity says Luther will die and demands access to a digital bunker in South Africa in order to survive.\nEthan tasks his team with getting the Sevastopol's coordinates and retrieving him after the dive. He races to save Luther; however, Gabriel steals the Poison Pill and traps Luther with a time bomb. Luther sacrifices himself to minimize the blast, and Ethan is brought to Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center. With three days until the Entity takes over the remaining nuclear weapons control facilities and launches nuclear armageddon, Ethan convinces Sloane to let him locate the Sevastopol, against CIA Director Eugene Kittridge's objections.\nGrace, Benji, Paris, and Degas travel to St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea, home to a Cold War era naval sonar array that detected the Sevastopol's sinking. They meet former CIA analyst William Donloe, who was exiled to the island after Ethan's 1996 break-in at CIA headquarters, who coincidentally memorized the Sevastopol's coordinates. Captured by Russian special forces seeking the coordinates, Grace and Donloe's wife Tapeesa escape by dog sled, and the others fight off the soldiers as Donloe transmits the coordinates to Ethan.\nEthan joins the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush in the North Pacific Ocean, and later boards the submarine USS Ohio. After receiving the coordinates and barely surviving a doomsday assassin that infiltrated the Ohio, Ethan uses an experimental diving suit to reach the Sevastopol and retrieve the Podkova, as the wreck slides down the continental shelf. Narrowly escaping without his diving suit, Ethan is revived from decompression sickness by Grace using a portable decompression chamber. Reunited with his team, Ethan plans to plug the Poison Pill into the Podkova, fooling the Entity into entering a physical drive instead of the bunker mainframe.\nAt the bunker, Gabriel ambushes the team with a timed nuclear device, demanding the Podkova. Kittridge interrupts, seeking control of the Entity. During the gunfight, the bomb activates and Benji is shot. Gabriel flees with the Poison Pill, pursued by Ethan with the Podkova. Donloe, Tapeesa, and Degas defuse the bomb; Paris, Grace, and Benji prepare the mainframe to trap the Entity.\nSloane avoids a preemptive nuclear strike, but the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is fatally wounded protecting her from a doomsday assassin, allowing the Entity time to take full control of the world's nuclear arsenal. Ethan chases Gabriel in a biplane, climbs onto his plane, breaks his arm, and retrieves the Poison Pill. Gabriel gets himself killed hitting the rudder while attempting to escape; Ethan finds another parachute, inserting the Poison Pill into the Podkova mid-air, allowing Grace to trap the Entity just before nuclear launch.\nEthan listens to a farewell message from Luther in the Poison Pill, which is destroyed afterwards. He gives the destroyed Podkova to Kittridge, and Briggs—revealed to be the son of Jim Phelps—makes peace with Ethan for exposing his father as a traitor. Reuniting in London, Grace gives Ethan the drive with the Entity, and the IMF team part ways.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nAdditionally, Jon Voight, Michelle Monaghan, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Hopkins, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Laurence Fishburne, Jeremy Renner, Paula Patton, Maggie Q, Jean Reno, Dougray Scott, Michael Nyqvist, Emmanuelle Béart, Lea Seydoux, Keri Russell, Kristen Scott Thomas, Henry Cavill, Vanessa Redgrave, and Alec Baldwin all appear in flashbacks as their respective characters Jim Phelps, Julia Meade-Hunt, Ilsa Faust, Alanna \"The White Widow\" Mitsopolis, Jack Harmon, Swanbeck, Owen Davian, Theodore Brassel, William Brandt, Jane Carter, Zhen Lei, Franz Krieger, Sean Ambrose, Dr. Kurt \"Cobalt\" Hendricks, Claire Phelps, Sabine Moreau, Lindsey Farris, Sarah Davies, August \"John Lark\" Walker, Max Mitsopolis, and Alan Hunley uncredited via archival footage from the first seven films (Hoffman and Nyqvist appearing posthumously). Director Christopher McQuarrie also makes a small cameo appearance at the end of the film.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nOn January 14, 2019, Tom Cruise announced that the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films would be shot back to back with Christopher McQuarrie writing and directing both films for July 23, 2021, and August 5, 2022, releases. However, in February 2021, Deadline Hollywood revealed that Paramount had decided to no longer move forward with that plan.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn September 2019, Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff joined the cast of the eighth installment. In December, Simon Pegg confirmed his return for the film, while Shea Whigham was also cast. Nicholas Hoult joined the cast by January 2020, along with Henry Czerny, who reprised his role as Eugene Kittridge from Dead Reckoning Part One and the first film. However, due to scheduling conflicts, Hoult was replaced by Esai Morales for both films. Vanessa Kirby, who first appeared in Fallout, announced she was returning for both films, but did not appear in Final Reckoning. In July 2022, it was reported that Holt McCallany had joined the cast. In August 2022, it was revealed Nick Offerman and Janet McTeer were also added to the cast. \nIn March 2023, McQuarrie announced Hannah Waddingham, Lucy Tulugarjuk and Rolf Saxon's addition to the cast, the latter of whom reprises his role from the first film. In March and April 2024, respectively, Katy O'Brian and Tramell Tillman joined the cast in then-undisclosed roles. In November 2024, it was revealed that Angela Bassett would reprise her role as CIA Director Erika Sloane.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nIn February 2021, Deadline Hollywood reported that the film would no longer be filmed back to back with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. By November, McQuarrie was in the process of rewriting the film's script. On March 23, 2022, The Hollywood Reporter reported the beginning of principal photography of the then untitled Mission: Impossible 8. Filming took place in the UK at Longcross Studios and the Lake District. Other locations included Malta, South Africa, and Norway. In December 2022, filming was finished in the UK. The crew then moved to Apulia in Italy to continue filming aboard the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush. During the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, production was thought to have been put on hold according to an interview with McQuarrie in the June 2023 issue of the Empire magazine. However, this was later revealed to have been a misinterpretation of McQuarrie's statement, and continued production was only waiting for the promotion of Part One to complete. Filming was officially suspended in July due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. \nThe film returned to production in March 2024, though in May, it encountered a delay due to a submarine malfunction. During filming in England, Cruise and Morales were observed performing stunts from an airborne biplane, with Cruise holding onto the wings of the open cockpit aircraft as it flew upside down, while the pilot wore a greenscreen suit so as to be digitally removed from the final shot. In July 2024, Simon Pegg revealed filming had concluded for his part, though the cast and crew were maintaining radio silence. By November 2024, production had concluded and the film was in post-production. The Hollywood Reporter reported that the budget had neared $400 million due to the production delays.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIndustrial Light & Magic returned from the seventh film to produce the visual effects, with Clear Angle Studios and Halon Entertainment as the additional vendors for lidar, cyber scanning, and previsualization. In October 2023, Dead Reckoning Part Two was removed as the film's subtitle, and the new subtitle was confirmed as The Final Reckoning in November 2024.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nLorne Balfe was originally announced in May 2020 to be composing the film's score, after previously doing so for Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018) and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023), but it was later announced in April 2025 that he would be replaced with Max Aruj and Alfie Godfrey. Aruj has previously provided additional music for Dead Reckoning and served as technical score assistant on Fallout. Both Aruj and Godfrey have contributed music to numerous projects scored by Balfe over the years. Cecile Tournesac was credited as the supervising music editor and score producer. The full album was released on May 23, 2025.\n\n\n== Release ==\nMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning had its world premiere in Tokyo on May 5, 2025. The film screened at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2025, prior to its scheduled theatrical release on May 23, by Paramount Pictures. It was previously set for release on August 5, 2022, but was delayed to November 4, 2022, July 7, 2023, June 28, 2024, and then to the current date in response to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, taking the original release date of The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants. Due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the budget for the film reportedly increased to at least $400 million, placing it among the most expensive films ever made. Based on typical industry expectations, the film may need to earn around $1 billion worldwide to recoup its production costs. However, in addition to its box office, its performance on Paramount+ is also expected to be a significant factor in evaluating its overall success.\nInternationally, it was released theatrically in Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, India and South Korea on May 17, 2025 before releasing in the United Kingdom on May 21. The film was released in Dolby Cinema, ScreenX, RPX, 4DX, IMAX and other premium formats.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning was released on digital download on August 19, 2025, and will be released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on October 14, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of August 28, 2025, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning has grossed $197.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $400.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $598.1 million.\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\nIn the United States and Canada, The Final Reckoning was released alongside Lilo & Stitch, and was initially projected to gross $80–110 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend. Final Reckoning earned $24.8 million on its opening day, which included $8.3 million from Thursday night previews, setting a new opening day record for the franchise. The film debuted to $64 million over its standard three-day weekend and reached $79 million across the four-day Memorial Day weekend, placing second behind Lilo & Stitch. Despite not topping the box office on its opening weekend, a first for the franchise, not counting Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol's limited release in IMAX and other large-format theaters in its first five days where it finished third, it contributed to the biggest Memorial Day weekend in domestic box office history, with all films combining for a record-breaking $334.5 million. In its second weekend the film made $27.3 million (a drop of 57%), remaining in second ahead of Karate Kid: Legends. In its third weekend the film made $14.8 million, and it finished in third place behind Lilo & Stitch and Ballerina.\n\n\n==== International ====\nThe Final Reckoning opened in 64 markets alongside the United States, earning $127 million on its opening weekend and with its biggest numbers coming from South Korea ($12.7 million), Japan ($11 million) and the United Kingdom ($10.7 million). The $31 million earned from IMAX screenings was the biggest of the franchise. It opened in China on June 2, topping the box office with a $25.6 million gross, with $4.9 million from IMAX screenings; it is also IMAX's biggest opening weekend for a Hollywood film in China in 2025.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nReviews of The Final Reckoning were generally positive but subdued compared to previous installments, with several critics praising the action scenes in the film, and expressing displeasure in the first hour, which they felt was dragged down by exposition. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of 417 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Gargantuan in action, runtime, and scope, The Final Reckoning is a sentimental sendoff for Ethan Hunt that accomplishes its mission with a characteristic flair for the impossible.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it an 89% overall positive score, with 79% saying they would definitely recommend the film.\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian rated the film five stars out of five, calling it a \"wildly silly, wildly entertaining adventure which periodically gives us a greatest-hits flashback montage of the other seven films\". In another positive review, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said the film was a \"satisfying capper to an eight-film franchise\" and praised the return of Rolf Saxon, \"He may not hang off a biplane, but the year's unlikeliest franchise MVP makes Final Reckoning something better than superhuman: human.\" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph said, \"Even by the series' own now well-established standards, this widely presumed last entry in Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible franchise is an awe-inspiringly bananas piece of work.\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying it \"stays true\" to the franchise's \"core tenets, even if it too often feels baggy and redundant\", and particularly praised \"a callback from the first film that strikes a particularly winning chord of humor and sentimentality\".\nBrian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com was more critical of the film, calling its first hour \"unwieldy and truly clunky\" and \"the worst segment in the entire franchise\", although he noted that the action sequences during the film's peaks were \"enough to ignore everything wrong with the movie up to that point\". Cary Darling of the Houston Chronicle described the film as a \"disappointing installment\" that felt \"bloated and tired, despite the dizzying, high-flying stunt work at the film's climax\". He also criticized its runtime, stating \"just shy of three hours (the longest in the series), it takes a heck of a long time to achieve lift-off\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nTom Cruise set a Guinness World Record for most burning parachute jumps by an individual while filming one of the film's final stunts, where Cruise burned his first parachute doused in flammable liquid before opening his second parachute a total of 16 times. An article about the stunt was published on the Guinness World Record website on June 5, 2025.\nAt the 5th Critics' Choice Super Awards, the film won Best Action Movie and Best Actor in an Action Movie (Cruise).\n\n\n== Future ==\nIn June 2023, McQuarrie told Fandango that both parts of Dead Reckoning would not necessarily end the series, and they were developing ideas for future installments. In July 2023, during promotion for Dead Reckoning, Cruise expressed interest in reprising his role as Hunt in future films, citing Harrison Ford's portrayal of Indiana Jones over 40 years from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023). On November 12, 2024, Jeff Sneider reported Cruise sought to cast Glen Powell, one of his co-stars in Top Gun: Maverick (2022), to replace him as the new lead for potential future Mission Impossible films. Powell denied this during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show. In May 2025, during the New York premiere for The Final Reckoning, Cruise confirmed that the film would be his final film (playing Ethan Hunt) in the series, stating, \"The film is the final! It's not called 'final' for nothing.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning at IMDb",

At first, she refused any medical help but complained of a severe headache about two hours after the accident. Richardson was flown to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, where she died two days later from an epidural hematoma. Her family issued a statement on the day of her death: \"Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love, and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time.\" Neeson donated Richardson's organs following her death. Later that night, theatre lights were dimmed on Broadway in Manhattan and in the West End of London as a mark of respect for Richardson. The following day, a private viewing was held at the American Irish Historical Society in Manhattan. \nOn 22 March, a private funeral was held at St. Peter's Episcopal Church near Millbrook, New York, close to the family's upstate home.

        "content": "Thunderbolts*  is a 2025 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the team Thunderbolts. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 36th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jake Schreier from a screenplay by Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, and stars an ensemble cast featuring Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. In the film, a group of antiheroes are caught in a deadly trap and forced to work together on a dangerous mission.\nMarvel Studios first teased the formation of an MCU Thunderbolts team in 2021. The film was revealed to be in development in June 2022, when Schreier and Pearson were attached. The main cast was revealed in September, with additional casting through early 2023. Lee Sung Jin joined to rewrite the script by March 2023, one of several creatives who returned to work with Schreier from the Netflix series Beef (2023–present). Production was delayed by the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, causing some cast changes in early 2024. Calo joined by then for further rewrites. Filming took place from February to June 2024 at Trilith Studios and Atlanta Metro Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and on location in Utah and Kuala Lumpur.\nThunderbolts* premiered on April 22, 2025, at the Cineworld Leicester Square in London, England, and was released in the United States on May 2 as the final film of Phase Five of the MCU. The asterisk in the title was the subject of commentary during the film's marketing campaign, and was explained by the reveal at the end of the film that the Thunderbolts team is rebranded as the \"New Avengers\"; the title is changed to The New Avengers during the film's end credits and in some post-release marketing. The film received positive reviews from critics, but underperformed at the box office, grossing $382 million.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Malaysia, Yelena Belova destroys a laboratory on behalf of CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, who is attempting to destroy any evidence of her involvement with the O.X.E. Group's \"Sentry\" superhuman project. As de Fontaine faces imminent impeachment for her work with O.X.E. Group, she dispatches Yelena, John Walker, Ava Starr, and Antonia Dreykov—all operatives who have worked for her—to a covert O.X.E. facility with orders to kill each other. In the ensuing fight, Ava kills Antonia while an amnesiac man named Bob is released from a suspended animation pod in the room. After realizing that they were sent by de Fontaine to be incinerated along with any evidence of her misconduct, they work together to escape from the trap. Upon coming into physical contact with Bob, Yelena and Walker briefly experience visions of some of their worst memories.\nDe Fontaine learns that the group has survived and that Bob was a presumed-dead volunteer in the Sentry trials. When she arrives at the site, Bob creates a diversion by drawing enemy fire, allowing Yelena, Walker, and Ava to escape. Bob sustains no injuries upon being shot, uncontrollably ascends into the air, crash-lands back at the compound, and is captured and transported to the former Avengers Tower in Manhattan, now renamed the \"Watchtower\". De Fontaine intends to introduce Bob to the press as a super-powered protector akin to the Avengers, hoping the PR stunt will avert her impeachment. Meanwhile, Yelena's father-figure Alexei Shostakov, who overheard details of de Fontaine's plot while working as a freelance chauffeur, rescues Yelena, Walker, and Ava. Alexei refers to the group as the \"Thunderbolts\", inspired by Yelena's childhood soccer team.\nCongressman Bucky Barnes is tipped off about what has happened by de Fontaine's assistant Mel. He captures the Thunderbolts and intends to have them testify in the impeachment proceedings. When Mel expresses concern about Bob, Barnes takes the group to New York City to infiltrate the Watchtower. The Thunderbolts discover that de Fontaine has convinced Bob to join her and become the superhero \"Sentry\". Bob easily overpowers the Thunderbolts, but he ignores de Fontaine's order to kill them and allows them to retreat, believing that they are not a threat to him. Developing a god-like delusion of superiority, Bob turns on de Fontaine and is stopped by Mel using a failsafe kill switch. This triggers the emergence of the Void, Bob's destructive alter ego and the embodiment of his depression and insecurities which have been amplified by the Sentry procedure. The Void begins to engulf New York City in supernatural darkness, trapping its citizens in visions of their own traumatic memories.\nRealizing that the only way to stop the Void is from within, Yelena enters the darkness to reach Bob's consciousness. She faces her haunted past as a Black Widow, and finds Bob hiding in a recreation of his childhood bedroom where he hid from his abusive father. The other Thunderbolts join them, and together they face off with Bob's various traumas and drug addiction until they reach his memory of the Sentry procedure in the Malaysia laboratory. They find the Void and are swiftly overpowered. Bob's attempts to fight back threaten to consume him completely, until the Thunderbolts hug Bob and affirm their belief in him which empowers Bob to regain control and overcome the Void. Light returns to the city and the victims are freed. With the threat of the Void neutralized, the Thunderbolts prepare to apprehend de Fontaine. She manipulates public perception by staging a press conference in which she introduces the team as the New Avengers and takes credit for their actions. The group goes along with the announcement, but Yelena quietly tells de Fontaine, \"We own you now.\"\nIn a post-credits scene set fourteen months later, the New Avengers and Bob discuss a growing feud with Sam Wilson, who has his own Avengers team and is suing the New Avengers for trademark infringement. There is also an ongoing problem in outer space, and the group are interrupted when the Watchtower detects the arrival of an extra-dimensional spacecraft that has a large \"4\" emblem on the side.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nFlorence Pugh as Yelena Belova:A member of the Thunderbolts who was trained in the Red Room as a Black Widow assassin. Pugh said the character has been affected by the traumatic events of recent Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) projects, including the death of her adoptive sister Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow in the film Avengers: Endgame (2019). Co-writer Eric Pearson explained that while the loss of Romanoff was addressed, there was not more looking to the past to \"push forward\" to give Yelena a \"big leadership role moving forward\". Pugh was shocked by the reveal that the Thunderbolts would be known as the New Avengers, and believed Yelena being a part of that team was \"probably keeping her alive\", giving her purpose with a family unit that relied on her and \"allowed her to feel loved again\". Violet McGraw reprises her role as a young Yelena from the film Black Widow (2021).\nSebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier:An enhanced super soldier with a cybernetic arm who is the de facto leader of the Thunderbolts. Presumed killed in action during World War II, he reemerged in the present day as a brainwashed assassin before his programming was removed, and has since been elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives. Pearson said Barnes was originally written to be \"kind of a [political] lobbyist\" who helped politicians \"propagandize\", making it seem as though the character had fallen from grace until it is revealed that he was doing that to investigate de Fontaine. After Pearson finished his work on the film, Feige suggested that Barnes should be a congressman instead. Stan compared Barnes to Jack Nicholson's character Randle McMurphy in the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), saying they were both coming into a chaotic and degenerate group whose members need to be united.\nWyatt Russell as John Walker / U.S. Agent:An enhanced super soldier and member of the Thunderbolts. He is a former decorated Captain of the U.S. Army Rangers who was chosen by the U.S. government to become Steve Rogers's successor as Captain America before receiving an other than honorable discharge in the Disney+ miniseries The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021).\nOlga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster:An assassin with photographic reflexes that allow her to mimic opponents' fighting styles. She was formerly controlled by her father, Dreykov, to complete missions for the Red Room before being freed by Romanoff in Black Widow.\nLewis Pullman as Robert \"Bob\" Reynolds / Sentry / Void:A superpowered individual suffering from amnesia who is believed to be stronger than all of the Avengers combined. As the Void, a version of Sentry completely shrouded in shadows, he is invincible, spreads darkness, and can turn people into shadows, sending them to a dimension of his own creation where they experience their worst fears and memories. Bob's mental health character arc was based on the experiences of a friend of director Jake Schreier. Having recently played Lt. Robert \"Bob\" Floyd in the film Top Gun: Maverick (2022), Pullman asked Schreier if the character could be addressed \"Robert\" instead of \"Bob\" to avoid repetition, but the filmmaker explained its importance in the source material; Pullman grew to like the name.\nGeraldine Viswanathan as Mel: Valentina Allegra de Fontaine's assistant. Mel was in high school when the Avengers first assembled in the film The Avengers (2012). Viswanathan related to Mel's inner struggle with her moral compass, specifically \"her optimism in entering the workforce, how your idealism can get challenged, and how it can be more difficult than you think to be a force of good in the world.\"\nChris Bauer as Holt: A security officer for O.X.E. Group\nWendell Pierce as Gary: A Congressman who is resolute on impeaching de Fontaine.\nDavid Harbour as Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian:A member of the Thunderbolts who is the Russian super soldier counterpart to Captain America and a father-figure to Yelena. Harbour said the film further explores the complex relationship between Shostakov and Yelena that was introduced in Black Widow. He noted that Yelena cannot stand Shostakov, but she needs someone to help her feel complete, and Shostakov fills that role.\nHannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr / Ghost:A member of the Thunderbolts who can phase through objects. John-Kamen said the film shows a different side of the character following her introduction in the film Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), with Ghost no longer in a constant state of molecular disequilibrium and able to control her powers with calmness and decisiveness.\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine:A contessa and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who brings together the members of the Thunderbolts. The film establishes de Fontaine as the one who bought Avengers Tower, now referred to as the \"Watchtower\", from Tony Stark in the film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). Louis-Dreyfus described de Fontaine as someone who is \"after power, control, and just generally she wants to kick ass in the Marvel Universe\". She added that the loss of power was her greatest weakness, saying, \"She doesn't realize, number one, she doesn't have it, and number two, she doesn't necessarily need it. But for her, the loss of power is a devastating notion and unacceptable.\" Louis-Dreyfus felt it was a \"very happy surprise\" exploring de Fontaine's backstory in the film, during an encounter with the Void, where she relives witnessing her father's death, hence giving an understanding to where she came from. She felt de Fontaine was an \"open wound\" during that moment and had no control over it. Chiara Stella portrays a young Valentina during a flashback sequence.\nAdditionally, Gabrielle Byndloss reprises her role as Walker's wife Olivia from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nDuring the production of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), director James Gunn expressed interest in making a film based on the Marvel Comics team Thunderbolts, a group of \"anti-heroes and super-criminals\". Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said this was a possibility based on the success of Guardians of the Galaxy. By May 2021, Gunn was no longer interested in the idea after directing the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film The Suicide Squad (2021), because that team from DC Comics is based on a similar concept to the Thunderbolts. In June 2018, Hannah John-Kamen expressed enthusiasm for reprising her role as Ava Starr / Ghost from the MCU film Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) in a potential Thunderbolts film, considering the comics version of Ghost is a member of the team.\nSpeculation that a Thunderbolts team would be introduced to the MCU began in mid-2019 following the announcement that Daniel Brühl would appear as Helmut Zemo in the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), reprising his role from the MCU film Captain America: Civil War (2016). That series introduced Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine and shows her recruiting Wyatt Russell's John Walker / U.S. Agent. De Fontaine is also shown to be working with Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova in the post-credits scene of the MCU film Black Widow (2021). Commentators speculated that she is recruiting a team of villains or antiheroes like the Thunderbolts, and some felt that team could appear in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Executive producer Nate Moore said the Thunderbolts were never considered for the project because they would \"cloud the story\" and take away from other aspects of the series. Head writer Malcolm Spellman said there was \"a lot of chatter\" around the team's potential introduction to the MCU and added, \"I don't know if fans are crazy or not\".\n\nFollowing his work on Black Widow, writer Eric Pearson brought the idea of a Thunderbolts film to Marvel Studios, realizing that Pugh had the potential to headline the film, given that Yelena was \"a natural leader\". He was drawn to the story potential of Yelena leading the Thunderbolts to go up against de Fontaine. By centering the story on Yelena, Pearson decided to include her father Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian on the team, with Pearson also including Ghost because he had wanted to write the character. Bucky Barnes was also added to the team after a few drafts. The roster for the team eventually became Yelena, Shostakov, Ghost, Barnes, Walker, and Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster, with the character Bob Reynolds / Sentry added shortly after; this roster stayed consistent through subsequent drafts. To choose the team members, the creatives had looked through the roster of MCU characters to find \"not just bad guys who could be good but characters that exist more on that morally grey plane or who were potentially destined for something else but then something went awry\". Pearson likened Yelena to Michael Corleone and Barnes to Tom Hagen, characters from Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather (1969). In some of the initial drafts, Pearson had included Bill Foster / Goliath to continue his relationship with Ghost from Ant-Man and the Wasp, before joining the team by the end of the film. He was ultimately removed from the film, in part because Foster \"didn't have the same background trauma that these other characters had, which was the unifying theme\".\nBy June 2022, Jake Schreier was attached to direct Thunderbolts, from a screenplay by Pearson, with Feige producing. Schreier was hired after a presentation that \"blew away\" Marvel Studios executives. At that time, the studio had been in contact with actors to discuss their availability to reprise their roles for the film. Schreier had considered including Man-Thing as a member of the team while pitching for the film, who Pearson called \"an unpredictable creature\" explaining that they could not find a way to have his inclusion make sense for the story in part because the character was drawing visual and narrative attention away from Bob. Another core concept that stayed consistent from the early drafts was the members being sent to kill each other, which Schreier believed provided a \"neat twist\" for audiences expecting Marvel Studios' version of the Suicide Squad; Pearson also believed it was important for Thunderbolts not to \"rehash\" the story beats of that team – an authority figure forcing criminals to work together – since audiences would have been familiar with that from both Suicide Squad (2016) and The Suicide Squad. Thus it did not make sense for the film to include Zemo or Thaddeus Ross, the leaders who had formed the team in the comics, despite Schreier wanting to try to incorporate Zemo. Pearson said the two characters' inclusion was discussed if it made sense narratively, as it would have honored the comics, but would not have featured them if it was for fan service. Zemo was included in an early post-credits scene idea where he would have been seen in prison \"pulling the strings\" similar to Keyser Söze, the antagonist in the film The Usual Suspects (1995), but this was quickly moved on from. The film was officially announced in July at San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC), with a release date of July 26, 2024. It was set to be the last film in Phase Five of the MCU.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn September 2022, Justin Kroll of Deadline Hollywood described the film as a spin-off for Yelena because she was expected to lead the antihero team, with Pugh and Russell believed to be reprising their roles, along with the inclusion of Brühl. At the D23 Expo later that month, Pugh, Russell, John-Kamen, and Louis-Dreyfus were confirmed to star, alongside Sebastian Stan as Barnes, David Harbour as Red Guardian, and Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster, all reprising their roles from previous MCU projects. Pugh was set to be paid eight figures for Thunderbolts and another MCU film. Prior to the cast announcement for the team, commentators had also suggested it could have included characters such as Abomination or Clint Barton. Schreier compared the character dynamics to those in the films Reservoir Dogs (1992), Ronin (1998), and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011), which are all about a \"mis-matched team forced to work together\". He also pointed to a less-likely inspiration in the film Toy Story 3 (2010), saying the Thunderbolts members are all facing obsolescence like the Toy Story characters are in that film. Harbour said the film would be unique in the MCU, describing the main cast as \"a bunch of misfits and outcasts and losers and people who don't really live up to the super in superhero\". Pugh said the joy of uniting these characters was that they \"don't play well together\", while Russell expressed confidence that the film would be interesting, fun, and not a \"straightforward\" Marvel film. Journalist Jeff Sneider reported that Pearson's script focused too much on the characters returning from Black Widow, which he also wrote, and Marvel Studios was looking for the other characters to have a more equitable role so it would feel like an ensemble film. Schreier did not believe the film was a Black Widow sequel but rather \"a sampling of people from different parts\" of the MCU, acknowledging the writers pulled from all of their histories, including Yelena and Shostakov's relationship that was established in Black Widow. One of Pearson's drafts started the film with a scene of Yelena confronting de Fontaine about sending her to kill Barton, furthering the storyline that was established in the post-credits scene of Black Widow and continued in the Disney+ series Hawkeye (2021); Pearson said their confrontation helped emphasize de Fontaine's manipulation but ultimately was not relevant to the larger story being told.\n\nAyo Edebiri joined the cast in January 2023 as de Fontaine's assistant Mel, when Louis-Dreyfus said filming would begin that June. In February, Steven Yeun was cast as Sentry with the potential to continue in future MCU films. Yeun worked with Schreier on the Netflix series Beef (2023–present), and the director had the actor in mind when adding the character. The next month, Beef creator Lee Sung Jin revealed that he was rewriting the script at Schreier's request and said there were \"a lot of themes and exciting things\" that drew him to the project. He worked closely with Schreier on the script and noted that, unlike Beef, Thunderbolts was Schreier's project and had different writing needs than the series, given the film's large scope and scale. With the team largely consistent, Schreier worked in subsequent drafts to \"go deeper\" with the characters \"on the margins\" such as Mel and Congressman Gary and \"[tying] their arcs together into something that would feel resonant\".\nAt the start of May 2023, filming was delayed due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike and was planned to resume after the strike concluded. In June, the release date was pushed back to December 20, 2024, and the Utah Film Commission announced that Thunderbolts would film in Emery County and Grand County, Utah, spending over $4.5 million in the state. Chapek said the \"grounded, globe-trotting film\" would use several practical filming locations and the Utah locations were chosen because they felt \"untouched by the larger world\". Sanja Milkovic Hays was the costume designer after working on the MCU films Captain Marvel (2019) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). When the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike ended in November, the release date was pushed back again, this time to July 25, 2025. Upon returning from the strike, Schreier and the creatives were able to reexamine the script. They determined that there was no sense of \"tension and unpredictability\", and the film felt \"bloodless\" when there should be the tension of not knowing who would survive, given who these characters are. To solve this, they decided to rework Taskmaster's involvement in the film, killing the character \"early and dry\" in the film to have her death \"resonate\" and inform the fates of the other characters throughout the rest of the film. Having the death occur later in the film was also discussed, but Schreier said the sadness from it would \"hang over\" the rest of the film and distract from the intended storyline of forming a strong bond between Yelena and Bob. In Pearson's original draft, Taskmaster survived until the end and had a sub-plot where she bonded with Ghost, as well as a recurring joke where she kept forgetting she had made friends with the other characters and was still trying to assassinate Walker because of her memory loss. Pearson understood why the decision was made to kill Taskmaster, also believing the memory loss assassination joke drifted too close to Bob's arc as he also was dealing with memory loss. Additionally, his post-credit scene featuring Kang the Conqueror was abandoned because Marvel Studios had decided to move away from that storyline.\nFollowing the strike-caused production delays, filming was slated to begin around March or April 2024. Yeun exited in January 2024 due to a scheduling issue caused by the delayed production, but expressed interest in working on a future MCU film. It was unclear if Marvel would recast or rethink Yeun's role, but at the end of the month Lewis Pullman was revealed to be the studios' top choice to replace Yeun as Sentry, and his casting was soon confirmed. Geraldine Viswanathan was cast to replace Edebiri as Mel after she exited due to the delays. In February, the release date was moved forward to May 2, 2025, swapping places with the MCU film The Fantastic Four: First Steps. By the end of the month, Joanna Calo had joined to serve as the writer during production and was rewriting the script. For the film's final writing credits, Pearson was credited for the story and received a screenplay credit alongside Calo, while additional off-screen literary material was attributed to Lee.\nThe script explores mental health, specifically loneliness and depression, particularly with Bob / Sentry. Pearson always envisioned ending the film with the emotional moment of giving someone a hug rather than fighting them. Before Sentry was added to the film, Walker was intended to be the main antagonist, with de Fontaine manipulating him into believing his super soldier serum was wearing off and giving him pills as a solution, making him into a \"time bomb\" that made him more unlikable and \"the monster\". Pearson said this version \"didn't ever totally work\", and Walker's actions felt too similar to the plot line of Thaddeus Ross becoming the Red Hulk in the MCU film Captain America: Brave New World (2025); Pearson had considered Red Hulk for the film's villain early in the process, which Marvel Studios declined because of their intended plans for Brave New World. Looking for a new antagonist that would not easily be beatable in a fight, Pearson remembered reading the Sentry miniseries years prior and felt Sentry and his alter ego the Void would work for \"heroic ambition and self-esteem versus depression and self-loathing and loneliness and isolation\"; he called Sentry \"the entire journey for our heroes rolled into one entity\" and his inclusion helped make the story cohesive. Pearson was glad he was able to incorporate many elements of the character's comics backstory to fit into the MCU. Said backstory, consisting of Sentry erasing himself from the world's memories to stop the Void, was avoided because it was similar to the plot of No Way Home, in which Peter Parker / Spider-Man also has himself erased from memory. Paul Jenkins, co-creator of Sentry, discussed the character with the creatives, with Schreier calling Sentry and the work Jenkins did with the character \"a parable for mental health\". Schreier explained that Lee felt mental health discussion was \"not niche anymore\" and it allowed them to \"tell a story about that internality and still have a lot of comedy and action for something that feels big and universal\".\nThe Thunderbolts* team believed the film was a good opportunity to further explore ideas they had started to explore in Beef on a larger scale. Executive producer Brian Chapek came up with the idea that, to defeat Sentry, the Thunderbolts would have to enter the Void, which manifested memories of their greatest shame, dubbed \"shame rooms\". Lee worked closely with production designer Grace Yun, who also served that role on Beef, to create the initial specifics of each room. Pearson had originally envisioned them as \"ethereal and dreamy\" but believed making them mazes akin to those seen in the film Being John Malkovich (1999) helped with visualizing the concept and made them feel \"more unsettling\". Calo further enhanced the shame rooms, suggesting that when Yelena enters to Void to help Bob that she return to her initial room seen earlier in the film. Schreier explained that this made a \"callback of the idea that the greatest shame of all was thinking that you could be something bigger than yourself, that [Bob's] aspirations towards heroism are actually what brings everything down and that you need to learn to be ok with who you are without that\". Shame rooms for Yelena, Walker, and de Fontaine are visible, with rooms for the other characters conceived for the film's finale, allowing the team to escape through them. However, Calo felt strongly that to journey to the heart of the Void, there needed to be a \"Big Bad moment\" beforehand, and the team should journey through Bob's shame rooms. The other shame rooms included: Shostakov being thrown in the gulag; Ghost growing up in an orphanage with no one wanting to be around her; and multiple different ones for Bucky that were \"a little less than the expected idea\", including a \"shameful moment\" in the Boy Scouts.\nSchreier had suggested during his pitch meeting that one of the film's posters or trailers should use an asterisk in the title to imply they needed to \"come up with something better\"; Feige, Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, and the marketing team loved this idea and decided to fully embrace it for the title and marketing campaign; with the film formally retitled to Thunderbolts* by March 2024. This allowed the creatives to realize that having the asterisk could lead to the reveal of a new title for the film once it was released, which was subsequently done, changing the title to The New Avengers after the ending reveals the Thunderbolts to be the New Avengers. Schreier said the ending was always going to have the Thunderbolts revealed as the New Avengers team, and the rest of the film became about \"building the right story that lived up to that\". Pearson explained that Feige suggesting de Fontaine should introduce the Thunderbolts to the public as the Avengers; additional discussions were had on what this meant, such as if the \"n\" in \"new\" should be upper or lowercase, and what the implications of each decision would mean. Thunderbolts* included \"little hints\" throughout so the ending did not come as a total surprise – such as the Battle of New York gala, Avengers Tower becoming the Watchtower, and Mel explaining how she was in high school when the Avengers first formed. Additionally, the credits and the post-credit sequences acknowledge that the New Avengers is \"not necessarily the most comfortable or perfect fit\" for these characters. The original Thunderbolts name was derived from Yelena's youth soccer team.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nFilming was originally scheduled to begin in mid-June 2023 and last for six months. It was initially not expected to be impacted by the writers' strike, with Marvel Studios reportedly planning to shoot what they could during principal photography and make any necessary writing adjustments during already scheduled reshoots. Filming was ultimately delayed by the writers' strike and subsequent SAG-AFTRA strike. The original filming schedule overlapped with Stan's work on the film The Apprentice (2024), for which he gained weight to portray Donald Trump. He had begun the physical transformation needed to portray Barnes when the strikes began and he had to reverse course. Harbour planned to shoot the film concurrently with his scenes as Jim Hopper for the fifth season of Stranger Things (2025), also in Atlanta; that production was also delayed by the strikes.\nPrincipal photography began by February 26, 2024, at Trilith Studios and Atlanta Metro Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, under the working title Oops All Berries, which is a reference to a variation of the cereal Cap'n Crunch that only has berry-flavored pieces. Andrew Droz Palermo was the cinematographer, having previously worked on the Marvel Studios series Moon Knight (2022). He replaced Steve Yedlin who was originally intended to work on the film. The film was shot for IMAX. Filming occurred in Emery County and Grand County, Utah, from May 29 to June 12, 2024. Louis-Dreyfus completed her scenes by early June, and said Marvel Studios was trying to \"go back to their roots\" with a focus on the characters' humanity, practical stunt sequences, and avoiding visual effects where possible. Filming also took place at the Medan Pasar square and Merdeka 118 skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Pugh was insistent on filming the scene where Yelena jumps off the top of Merdeka 118 without the use of stunt doubles. Marvel Studios was initially reluctant to allow Pugh to perform the stunt for insurance reasons, but after continually pushing the matter, including to Feige, she was allowed to perform the jump. For Yelena's trip through the shame rooms to save Bob, Palermo using a \"handheld, hand-made aesthetic\" similar to indie films such as Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), and those produced by A24 such as Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022). Feige championed doing as many of the effects practically and in camera as possible and Schreier noted the creatives liked the idea of doing a \"practical rendition of what getting stuck in a thought loop or a shame room would be\". Filming concluded the week of June 19.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn September 2024, Chris Bauer and Wendell Pierce were revealed to have been cast in the film, with Bauer playing Holt and Pierce playing Congressman Gary. The film's teaser trailer released that month revealed that Scarlett Johansson, who portrayed Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow in the MCU from 2010 to 2021, was credited as an executive producer. However, Johansson asked for her credit to be removed from the film because she had no involvement with it. In early December, additional photography took place in Atlanta, including to shoot the \"Meth Chicken\" shame room sequence from Bob's memories. Harry Yoon and Angela Catanzaro edited the film; Yoon previously worked on the MCU film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) and with Schreier on Beef. Jake Morrison is the visual effects supervisor, with visual effects provided by Industrial Light & Magic, Framestore, Digital Domain, Rising Sun Pictures, Raynault VFX, Base FX, Crafty Apes, and Mammal Studios.\nThunderbolts* includes a post-credits scene set 14 months after the end of the film where the New Avengers, discussing a problem in outer space, are notified of an extradimensional spacecraft entering Earth-616, which is revealed to be the Fantastic Four's. Schreier said this scene was filmed approximately a month before the film's release, on the Avengers: Doomsday (2026) set by that film's directors, the Russo brothers, and was intended for that film; Schreier was on set when the post-credits scene was filmed. Schreier helped conceive the scene while noting the characters were being given over to a \"whole new world and new scope\" to function in, and enjoyed seeing them \"directed in another context and on a different level of scope\" than had been done for this film. Pearson believed Calo had written the post-credits scene. It originally included a sequence that was cut where Barnes and Walker had a \"Who's on First?\"–style exchange about the ship having the number four on it. Stan called the bit \"genius\" and was sad it had been cut, with Russell saying the exchange became \"a Leslie Nielsen sketch\".\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe band Son Lux began recording the score for Thunderbolts* at Abbey Road Studios in London in the first week of February 2025, after member Ryan Lott previously scored Schreier's film Paper Towns (2015). A soundtrack album featuring their music was released by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on April 30, 2025.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nAfter filming had begun in March 2024, Pugh and Marvel Studios released a set video in which she showcased her new Black Widow costume and an updated logo for the film with Schreier. The new logo styled the title as \"Thunderbolts* \". Kristen Lopez at TheWrap felt viewers would \"start deconstructing the brief images she's shown immediately\", while Sabina Graves of Gizmodo felt the video was delightful and a fun tease for a scene featuring Yelena. She highlighted Pugh's short hair and her joking with Schreier that they \"really shouldn't be showing any of this\". Collider's Chris McPherson also discussed Pugh's costume, calling it \"very military [and] quite tactical\", and noted her teal eyeliner. Several commentators questioned why there was an asterisk in the updated logo. The next month, Feige confirmed that Thunderbolts* was the official title and said the use of the asterisk would be explained following the film's release, which led to continued speculation as to its meaning. One theory suggested the team would not be called the Thunderbolts in the film, but rather a variation of the Avengers name such as the Dark Avengers or New Avengers. Another suggestion stated there was another Thunderbolts team in the MCU with characters more closely aligned to the rosters from the comics.\n\nA behind-the-scenes look was shown at CineEurope in June 2024, while the first footage from the film was shown at SDCC the next month, presented by Schreier and the cast. Harbour dressed as Red Guardian for the panel. Following online leaks of the SDCC footage, Marvel released an official look at the Thunderbolts team within their video celebrating the company's 85th anniversary in August. A teaser trailer for the film was released in a month later, featuring the song \"Where Is My Mind?\" by the Pixies. Tom Power at TechRadar said the teaser was a longer and higher quality version of the previously leaked footage, and felt the film was \"looking very good\". He highlighted the characters' struggles with identity as well as the action and tone of the teaser. Writing for The A.V. Club, Mary Kate Carr noted the various mysteries surrounding the film—including the asterisk in its title—and said the teaser \"valiantly\" refused to give up any secrets or plot details. A second trailer was shown during Super Bowl LIX in February 2025. Commentators stated that the trailer appeared to confirm speculation that the titular team would be fighting the Void, the malevolent alter-ego of Bob / Sentry. In the trailer, Red Guardian expresses hope that the team's achievements would get them featured on the cover of Wheaties, a cereal known for putting sports figures on its boxes and the slogan \"The Breakfast of Champions\". Alongside the trailer, Marvel Studios released a poster for the film that mimicked a Wheaties box featuring the team. Their social media posts for the poster were captioned \"The Breakfast of Champions Thunderbolts*\". An asterisk-themed international poster was also released, which included a footnote for the title asterisk which says \"The Avengers Are Not Available\". Kieran Fisher at /Film questioned whether this was a joke, or if it was the true meaning behind the asterisk in the film's title. James Whitbrook of Gizmodo and Scott Collura from IGN both believed the footnote fit with the film's marketing approach of presenting the team as a ragtag humorous group of heroes, rather than the asterisk being an \"actual serious mystery\".\nIn March 2025, Letterboxd debuted a trailer for the film that is edited in the style of those for independent films produced by A24. It features techno music, an \"A24-esque makeover\" for the Marvel Studios logo, and title cards that highlight past A24 projects that the film's cast and crew members worked on. Schreier helped conceive the trailer, which was released around the same time Pugh described the film as an \"indie, A24-feeling assassin movie with Marvel superheroes\". Zosha Millman from Polygon said Marvel had \"film buffs in mind\" when releasing the trailer through Letterboxd. Despite the creative pedigree touted by the trailer, she thought Thunderbolts* would still be \"largely what you expect\" of a Marvel film. A24 was not aware of the trailer before its release and responded on social media with a meme from its HBO drama series Euphoria (2019–present). Later in March, Marvel Studios announced that many MCU cast members would be reprising their roles for the crossover film Avengers: Doomsday, including Stan, Russell, Pugh, Pullman, Harbour, and John-Kamen. Commentators discussed whether this announcement, which seemingly revealed characters who survive the film's events and aligned with speculation that Taskmaster would die early in the story due to limited presence in trailers, was a spoiler. Michael Walsh at Nerdist criticized the announcement, feeling it had undermined one of the key reasons some people were interested in Thunderbolts*, which was the feeling that any of the main cast could die. He compared this to spoiling who survives the events of The Dirty Dozen (1967), and said Marvel should have excluded the Thunderbolts* cast members from the Doomsday announcement. Amelia Emberwing of IGN said \"knowing who makes it out alive [does not matter] much in a comic book franchise\" and also felt the announcement was not necessarily a spoiler because the returning actors could be playing versions of their characters from other universes within the multiverse.\nVarious fan screenings occurred on April 22, 2025, in 10 major cities across the U.S. At the end of April, Marvel announced a collaboration with Wheaties to create a limited edition box of the cereal, mimicking the Wheaties-inspired poster for the film. The film's marketing campaign was valued between $75–100 million, and featured partnerships with Harley-Davidson, Tide, Wheaties, Mike and Ike, Cupra Kiro with Formula E racing, LinkedIn, Perfect Sports, and Arizona Beverage Company.\n\nFollowing the film's opening weekend, Marvel Studios rebranded the film as The New Avengers. The studio released a video of the cast tearing away the Thunderbolts* logo from the poster to reveal The New Avengers, billboards and theater marquees were also updated to The New Avengers, and new posters were released. Schreier explained that revealing and embracing the updated title felt like it was part of the studio's plan and had been built up to since the asterisk was first included in the film's title. Disney clarified that the film was not formally retitled, just that the asterisk was \"spelled out\", and ticketing services still listed the film as Thunderbolts*, despite featuring the updated posters with the New Avengers name. Sydney Bucksbaum of Entertainment Weekly felt this was the first instance a film \"planned in advance to change its title a few days after its release for narrative purposes\".\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nThunderbolts* had its European premiere on April 22, 2025, at the Cineworld Leicester Square, London, and its Los Angeles premiere on April 28, 2025. The film was released in the United States on May 2, in IMAX, Dolby Cinema, RealD 3D, ScreenX, and 4DX. It was previously scheduled for July 26, 2024, December 20, 2024, and July 25, 2025. It is the final film of Phase Five of the MCU.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was released for digital download on July 1, 2025, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on July 29. The home media releases, all bearing the title Thunderbolts* (The New Avengers), include two deleted scenes, a gag reel, director's commentary, and featurettes. Thunderbolts* was released on Disney+ on August 27.\nIn the United Kingdom, Thunderbolts debuted at No. 2 on the UK Official Film Chart for the week ending July 9, based on digital home entertainment sales. Three weeks later, for the week ending July 30, the film ranked No. 8. It then climbed to No. 6 for the week ending August 6, up from No. 8 the previous week. Thunderbolts reached No. 1 for the week ending August 13, rising from No. 6, and retained the top spot for the following week ending August 20.\nIn the United States, Thunderbolts debuted at No. 1 on the Circana VideoScan combined DVD and Blu-ray sales chart, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD charts for the week ended August 2. High-definition formats accounted for 74% of first-week sales, with 35% from regular Blu-ray and 39% from 4K Ultra HD editions. The film remained at No. 1 on the Circana VideoScan combined DVD and Blu-ray sales chart, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray chart, for the week ended August 9. In its second week, high-definition formats accounted for 62% of total unit sales, with 43% from regular Blu-ray (up 8 points from its first week) and 19% from 4K Ultra HD editions (down 20 points), causing it to move to No. 2 on the 4K Ultra HD disc sales chart. Thunderbolts moved to No. 3 on the Circana VideoScan combined DVD and Blu-ray sales chart for the week ended August 16, after two weeks at No. 1. It remained No. 2 on both the dedicated Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD disc sales charts. High-definition formats accounted for 74% of total unit sales during the week, with 35% from regular Blu-ray and 39% from 4K Ultra HD editions.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of July 31, 2025, Thunderbolts* has grossed $190.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $192.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $382.4 million. It is one of the lowest grossing MCU films, with Variety reporting that it needed to earn an \"unachievable\" $425 million worldwide to break-even.\nIn mid-April 2025, Thunderbolts* was projected to have a $63–77 million opening weekend in the United States, with the \"target number\" expected to be $70 million. By the end of the month, the film was projected to earn $70–75 million domestically and $160–175 million globally on its opening weekend, with some domestic projections going as high as $80–90 million. The film earned $31.5 million domestically in its opening day, including $11.5 million from Thursday night previews. The film would gross $74.3 million in its domestic opening weekend, while also earning $86.1 million internationally for a total of $160.1 million, including $20 million from IMAX screenings. In its second weekend the film made $33.1 million, remaining atop the box office. The 55% drop was noted as good for an MCU film, compared to the 68% second weekend decrease by Captain America: Brave New World earlier that year. It made $17 million on its third weekend, a drop of 52%, and it dropped to second behind the new release of Final Destination Bloodlines.\nFeige attributed the film's low box office performance to audiences believing they needed to watch the MCU's Disney+ series to see the film, adding that he felt the studio should have better explained that this was not necessary.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 376 critics gave the film a positive review. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Assembling a ragtag band of underdogs with Florence Pugh as their magnetic standout, Thunderbolts* refreshingly goes back to the tried-and-true blueprint of the MCU's best adventures.\" Metacritic summarized the critical response as \"generally favorable\", based on a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 from 53 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave the film an average of 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend the film.\nWriting for NPR, critic Bob Mondello gave Thunderbolts* a generally positive review, calling the film \"a decently effective blend of misfit mercenaries and pop psychology\". Jake Coyle of the Associated Press gave it 3/4 stars, writing, \"All the assembled parts here, including an especially high-quality cast (even Wendell Pierce!) work together seamlessly in a way that Marvel hasn't in some time. Most of all, Pugh commands every bit of the movie.\" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film 2/5 stars, writing, \"It's just dollop upon dollop of dourness, all the way to an end-credits scene that has the nerve to tease brighter, less narratively convoluted times ahead. Talk about creating a market.\" Nicholas Barber of BBC Culture gave Thunderbolts* a generally positive review, praising its character-driven approach and Pugh's performance. He noted that the film offers a more grounded and emotionally resonant narrative compared to recent Marvel releases, while still delivering the expected action and humor.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website  at Marvel.com\nThunderbolts* at IMDb \nMotion poster revealing The New Avengers title",

        "title": "XXX (film series)",
        "content": "XXX (stylized as xXx and pronounced Triple X) is an American action spy film series created by Rich Wilkes. It consists of three full-length feature films: XXX (2002), XXX: State of the Union (2005) and XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017), and a short film: The Final Chapter: The Death of Xander Cage. The series has grossed $694 million worldwide.\n\n\n== Films ==\n\n\n=== XXX (2002) ===\n\nThe film was released on August 9, 2002, which stars Vin Diesel as Xander Cage, a thrill seeking extreme sports enthusiast, stuntman and rebellious athlete-turned-reluctant spy for the National Security Agency who is sent on a dangerous mission to infiltrate a group of potential Russian terrorists in Central Europe. The film also stars Asia Argento, Marton Csokas and Samuel L. Jackson. It was directed by Rob Cohen, who previously directed The Fast and the Furious (2001), in which Diesel also starred.\n\n\n=== XXX: State of the Union (2005) ===\n\nThe film was released on April 29, 2005, which stars Ice Cube as Darius Stone, a new agent in the Triple X program, who is sent to Washington, D.C. to defuse a power struggle amongst national leaders.\n\n\n=== XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017) ===\n\nThe film was released on January 20, 2017, and sees the return of Diesel as Xander Cage, who comes out of self-imposed exile, thought to be long dead, and is set on a collision course with a deadly alpha warrior and his team in a race to recover a sinister and seemingly unstoppable weapon known as Pandora's Box. Recruiting an all-new group of thrill-seeking cohorts, Xander finds himself enmeshed in a deadly conspiracy that points to collusion at the highest levels of world governments.\n\n\n=== Untitled fourth XXX film (TBA) ===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that a fourth film is in development. The project will be a joint-venture production, with The H Collective and iQiyi after the former acquired franchise rights from Revolution Studios. D. J. Caruso was believed to return as director, while Vin Diesel would reprise his role as Xander Cage. Production was scheduled to begin in early-2019. In November 2018, Jay Chou and Zoe Zhang joined the cast. Japanese rock star and musician Yoshiki was set to serve as the film's composer. In September 2023, it was reiterated that a fourth film was still in development, though production would not be able to start until Diesel completed his work on the upcoming eleventh Fast & Furious film. In 2024, an article by Deadline has stated that the film has been stalled due to The H Collective's financial problems and litigation with the xXx franchise film rights.\n\n\n== Short film ==\n\n\n=== The Final Chapter: The Death of Xander Cage (2005) ===\nIncluded with the 2005 Director's Cut DVD of the first film is a four-minute short titled The Final Chapter: The Death of Xander Cage, that serves as a prequel to XXX: State of the Union by detailing the alleged death of Xander Cage before the events of that film.\nIn the short film, Xander is played by Vin Diesel's stunt double Khristian Lupo (who never shows his face or speaks) while reusing some archival lines spoken by Diesel. It also features Leila Arcieri as Jordan King from the first film and John G. Connolly as Lt. Colonel Alabama \"Bama\" Cobb, one of the villains from xXx: State of the Union who is Deckert's right-hand man, as the man behind the attack on Xander.\nThe sequence opens with Xander driving in a car with Jordan King. He stops next to his apartment building. King makes sexual overtures to him and they get intimate. Suddenly they hear a noise and Xander goes to check it out. Cobb's men show up and abduct King. They plant a bomb in the building and drop her coat on the steps to trick Xander to his death. After confronting a homeless man, Xander returns to the building. He takes the bait left by Cobb and his henchmen and is apparently blown apart by a huge explosion. His trademark coat survives the blast. Cobb shows up and picks up a piece of burnt skin from Xander's neck which has the Triple X tattoo on it. He remarks \"Poor Xander, you never had very much between the ears.\" His men pick him up and drive off in their car. Cobb's motives for killing Xander are obvious; he doesn't want him to interfere in Deckert's plans. \"Feuer Frei\" by Rammstein plays in the background during the sequence.\n\n\n== Cast and crew ==\n\n\n=== Cast ===\n\n\n=== Crew ===\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office performance ===\n\n\n=== Critical and public response ===\n\nThe first film received mixed reviews from critics. Roger Ebert called it \"as good as a James Bond movie\". Adam Smith of Empire magazine called the movie, \"Sporadically entertaining, but seriously hampered by a very choppy screenplay\", and rating it three out of five stars. The film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Most Flatulent Teen-Targeted Movie, but lost to Jackass: The Movie.\nThe second film in the series was panned by critics, Boo Allen of the Denton Record Chronicle called it \"a chubby, surly, incomprehensible action hero\".\nBrian Orndorf of FilmJerk.com compared watching the film to running \"headfirst at top speed into a brick wall\". \nDavid Hiltbrand of the Philadelphia Inquirer said \"the plot swings between pathetically implausible and aggressively stupid\".\nSome critics liked the film. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called it \"that rare B movie that's rooted in gut-level stirrings of power and retaliation\". Paul Arendt of the BBC said, \"Viewed on its own trashy terms, it succeeds brilliantly\".\nThe third film received mixed reviews from critics. Dan Jolin of Empire magazine said, \"We've seen all these stunts pulled before, and seen them done better, but there's some pleasure to be had here — even if it's of the extremely guilty kind.\", rating it three out of five stars. Andrew Lapin of Uproxx gave the film a negative review, saying: \"There is an intellectual argument to be made in favor of the Fast & Furious franchise, which features diverse casts, operatic plotlines, and cartoon setpieces that often look like a child assembled them out of Hot Wheels sets. xXx is aiming for a much lower bar, striving only to be marketable, not inventive. The series is no longer interested in aping James Bond, lacking as it does a decent gadget or supervillain and often highlighting the sidekicks at the expense of Xander himself.\"\n\n\n== Video games ==\n\nA video game featuring Xander Cage was produced for Game Boy Advance, released in North America and Europe in 2002. The GameBoy Advance game received a rating of E in North America and 3+ rating in Europe unlike the film's PG-13 rating. In 2004, a XXX game was in development for the Xbox by Warthog Games, but it was cancelled; a prototype was leaked onto the Hidden Palace website in February 2022.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "title": "Sinners (2025 film)",
        "content": "Sinners is a 2025 American horror film produced, written, and directed by Ryan Coogler. Set in 1932 in the Mississippi Delta, the film stars Michael B. Jordan in dual roles as criminal twin brothers who return to their hometown where they are confronted by a supernatural evil. It co-stars Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton (in his film debut), Jack O'Connell, Wunmi Mosaku, Jayme Lawson, Omar Miller, and Delroy Lindo.\nCoogler began developing the film through his production company Proximity Media, with Jordan cast in the lead role. The project was announced in January 2024, and after a bidding war, Warner Bros. Pictures acquired distribution rights the following month. Additional roles were cast in April. Principal photography took place from April to July 2024. Longtime Coogler collaborator Ludwig Göransson composed the film's score and served as an executive producer.\nSinners premiered on April 3, 2025, at AMC Lincoln Square in New York City, and was theatrically released in United States on April 18, 2025, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received critical acclaim and grossed $366 million worldwide.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1932, identical twins and World War I veterans Elijah \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\" Moore return to Clarksdale, Mississippi, after working for the Chicago Outfit for seven years. Using money stolen from gangsters, they purchase a sawmill from landowner Hogwood to start a juke joint for the local Black community. Their cousin Sammie, an aspiring guitarist, joins them despite his pastor father Jedidiah's warnings about the sins of blues music.\nThe twins recruit pianist Delta Slim as a performer, local Chinese shopkeeper couple Grace and Bo Chow as suppliers, field worker Cornbread as a bouncer, and Smoke's wife Annie as a cook. Annie believes her Hoodoo practices kept the twins safe, but Smoke doubts them for not preventing their infant daughter's death. Stack runs into his white-passing ex-girlfriend Mary, who resents him for abandoning her out of protection. Elsewhere, Irish-immigrant vampire Remmick shelters from Choctaw vampire hunters with a married Klansmen couple, whom he turns into vampires.\nOn the joint's opening night, Sammie, Delta Slim, and Pearline – a singer with whom Sammie becomes enamored – perform on stage. Sammie's music is transcendent, unknowingly summoning spirits of both past and future to join the crowd. However, the performance also attracts Remmick and his vampires, who offer money and music in exchange for entry. A suspicious Smoke refuses. The twins realize that their patrons' reliance on company scrip makes it impossible for the joint to be profitable. Reasoning with Stack that outside income is necessary, Mary meets Remmick outside, where she is turned. Returning inside, she seduces and fatally bites Stack. Sammie and Smoke discover them; Smoke shoots Mary, but she is unaffected and escapes. Outside, Remmick turns Cornbread.\nSmoke closes the joint early; as the patrons and Bo leave, the vampires turn them. Stack revives as a vampire, but flees after Annie repels him with pickled garlic juice. Annie realizes their assailants are vampires and tells the survivors how to deter and defeat them and that killing Remmick will not revert the other vampires back to humans. Although Remmick and his vampires share a hive mind, their personalities remain intact.\nStill unable to enter the joint, Remmick tries to negotiate by inviting the survivors to join him, saying that vampirism offers immortality and freedom from persecution. He promises to leave in exchange for Sammie, whose musical skills he wants to use to summon the spirits of his lost community, also revealing that Hogwood heads the local Klan and plans to attack the joint at dawn. They refuse, and Remmick threatens to attack the Chows' daughter Lisa at their home.\nEnraged by the threat, Grace invites the vampires into the joint, and a fight ensues. Grace, Bo, Annie, and Delta Slim are killed as a result, while Mary escapes and Remmick turns Pearline. Smoke fights and defeats Stack and then assists Sammie in defeating the vampires, who are all incinerated by the light of the sunrise. Smoke sends Sammie home before he kills Hogwood and his men, but is fatally shot. He reunites with Annie and their daughter after dying. Meanwhile, Sammie disregards his father's pleas to seek salvation and travels to Chicago.\nSixty years later, an elderly Sammie, now a successful blues musician, is visited by an ageless Stack and Mary after performing at his blues club. Stack reveals that Smoke spared him at the joint on the condition that Sammie live in peace. After declining the couple's offer of immortality, Sammie performs for them. As they leave, Sammie admits that despite being haunted by that night, until the violence, it was the greatest day of his life. Stack wistfully agrees, since it was the last time he saw Smoke or the sun, and the only time they were all truly free.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn January 2024, an untitled period film (rumored to take place in the Jim Crow-era South and involve the undead) from writer, director and producer Ryan Coogler was reported to be in development through his production company Proximity Media, with longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan cast in the lead role. Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Universal Pictures were in a bidding war to acquire the distribution rights to the film, which carried a budget of around $90 million. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. greenlit the film with a production budget of $80 million, but the final budget climbed to $100 million. In exchange for the distribution rights to the film, Coogler was asking studios for first-dollar gross, final cut privilege, and ownership of the film twenty-five years after its release. The following month, Warner Bros. won the distribution rights to the film by acceding to Coogler's terms. Coogler cited the films of Quentin Tarantino, Jordan Peele, Christopher Nolan (who is given an on-screen special thanks credit), Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, Spike Lee and the Metallica song \"One\" as sources of inspiration.\nIn April 2024, Jack O'Connell was cast as the film's villain. Delroy Lindo, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller, Hailee Steinfeld, Li Jun Li and Lola Kirke were cast in undisclosed roles. Wunmi Mosaku was cast as Smoke's love interest. Yao, Miles Caton, Peter Dreimanis, and Christian Robinson were added the next month. Halsey would audition for the role that went to Steinfeld. Machine Gun Kelly was offered the opportunity to audition for the role that went to Peter Dreimanis but he declined because he was not comfortable saying the n-word.\nPrincipal photography began in New Orleans on April 14, 2024, under the working title Grilled Cheese, and wrapped on July 17. It was shot by cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw on 65 mm film using a combination of IMAX 15-perf and Ultra Panavision 70 cameras and scenes thus alternate between the 1.43:1 and 2.76:1 aspect ratios. Kodak created a 65mm version of their Ektachrome 100D 5294 film stock specifically for the production, where it was used for a flashback sequence. The production spent $67.6 million on-location in Louisiana. The film's allocated budget was reported to have ultimately risen to around $100 million. The film's production designer Hannah Beachler has acknowledged that the way the church in the film was designed included crossed beams that made the \"Wakanda Forever\" gesture and paid homage to the late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Storm Studios, Rising Sun Pictures, Base FX, Baraboom Studios, Light VFX and Outpost VFX provided the film's visual effects. Some of the film's costumes were originally designed by Ruth E. Carter for the planned Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Blade, but when production on it stalled Carter was approached by Coogler to work on the film. Given both films' shared time period and similar settings within the Prohibition era, Carter was able to reuse her research for Sinners and was allowed by Marvel Studios to buy costumes she made originally for Blade to be used on Sinners.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nCoogler's frequent collaborator Ludwig Göransson worked on the soundtrack of Sinners. Göransson described Sinners as a personal and ambitious score, reflecting his own musical journey. He drew inspiration from blues music and performed the score on a 1932 Dobro Cyclops resonator guitar, the same one Sammie carries throughout the film. During the pre-production, Coogler sent Göransson several recordings from the 1930s and 1940s, particularly those of Robert Johnson and Tommy Johnson. Göransson and Coogler insisted that Ludwig's wife Serena produce the songs. Serena Göransson, a classically trained violinist, said the southern Black music had to be handled with care and expert consultation and that she felt \"like a steward with this project [...] especially with the music. I just feel that it has a life of its own...\"\nThe couple worked with Lawrence \"Boo\" Mitchell, a blues producer who owns Royal Studios, and visited the B.B. King Museum and local juke joints in Clarksdale and Indianola with him for inspiration. The Göranssons and Mitchell recorded the songs at Royal Studios over five days with musicians such as Alvin Youngblood Hart and Cedric Burnside. Mitchell also brought in other blues musicians such as Brittany Howard, Raphael Saadiq, Bobby Rush, Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram and Buddy Guy (who also appears in the film). The Göranssons rented a studio converted from a church in New Orleans, and worked with the supporting cast of Jack O'Connell, Lola Kirke, Peter Dreimanis and Jayme Lawson, rehearsing their songs multiple times. Much of the film was recorded live on set, with the cast members performing alongside other blues musicians. Hailee Steinfeld wrote and recorded the original song \"Dangerous\" for the film.\nUnlike most Warner Bros. films, which have soundtracks released through the company's in-house label WaterTower Music, the soundtrack and score to Sinners were released through Sony Music labels. The soundtrack was released on Sony Masterworks on April 18, 2025, the same day as the film, featuring 22 tracks performed by an array of blues musicians, alongside the cast members. The lead single \"Sinners,\" performed by Rod Wave, was released two weeks prior.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nSinners was released in the United States and Canada on April 18, 2025. It was previously scheduled for release on March 7, 2025, but was delayed to April (swapping dates with Mickey 17) to allow for more time needed in post-production due to the scarcity of film stock labs for the project, which heavily utilized film cameras. In addition to a standard digital release, the film also received 10 IMAX 70 mm prints, and 5 standard 70 mm prints.\nIn late May, the film was screened in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where it is set. Clarksdale does not have a working movie theater, but the civic auditorium hosted six showings, introduced by Coogler, Göransson, and other filmmakers. The town also hosted panels and Q&As related to the film over the three-day weekend festival.\nAMC Theaters nationwide scheduled screenings of the film on Juneteenth at discounted prices.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nSinners was released on digital streaming on June 3, 2025, and on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on July 8, 2025. It premiered on HBO Max on July 4, 2025. Warner Bros. announced that Sinners would also be available to stream on HBO Max with interpretation in Black American Sign Language (BASL); the company stated that it was the first film to ever be offered by a streaming service with BASL.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of August 29, 2025, Sinners has grossed $278.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $88.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $366.7 million. Some publications said the film needed to gross $170–185 million to break-even when factoring in its production budget, Coogler's first-dollar gross, premium video-on-demand, and streaming deals with Prime and Netflix. Other industry sources placed the break-even point at $200–225 million, with Puck going as high as $300 million, because of the film's budget, estimated $50–60 million marketing spend, and the presumption that theaters keep half of ticket sales. Many fans of the film and industry figures like Ben Stiller criticized media coverage, specifically pieces from Variety, The New York Times, and Business Insider, that seemed to downplay the film's success by focusing on its box office performance, Coogler's salary, and speculation about its profitability.\nIn the United States and Canada, Sinners was projected to gross $30–40 million from 3,308 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $19.2 million on its first day, including an estimated $4.7 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $48 million, topping projections to finish first at the box office, upsetting Warner Bros.' own holdover A Minecraft Movie, which grossed $40.5 million in its third weekend. The opening marked the best start for an original film since Jordan Peele's Us ($71 million in 2019), and the first time a studio had two films make more than $40 million each over a single weekend since 2009. Walk-up business, particularly on Saturday, and word-of-mouth contributed substantially to the opening, with 61% of attendees buying their ticket the same day. Premium large format and IMAX screenings made up 45% of the opening. Exit polling indicated that 47% of moviegoers bought tickets because of Jordan, 40% for Coogler, and 45% because of positive word-of-mouth, and that 64% of attendees were 35 or younger, with 46% being 25–34 and 2% under 18. The audience was 49% Black, 27% Caucasian, 14% Latino and Hispanic, 6% Asian, and 4% Native American/other, \"a strong turnout among different demographics\". Sinners also made $15.4 million from 71 international markets, for a global opening weekend of $61 million.\nWord-of-mouth momentum helped Sinners earn the second-best Monday haul for an R-rated horror film at $7.8 million, behind It ($8.6 million in 2017). It ended its first week ahead of the seven-day totals of The Conjuring ($61.7 million in 2013) and Get Out ($49.8 million in 2017) with $77.5 million. Sinners exceeded second weekend projections ($19.2–24 million) to outgross new releases and top the box office again with $45.7 million. Its 4.9% drop is the third-best second-weekend performance for a film that debuted to more than $40 million after Shrek (+0.3% in 2001) and Avatar (−1.8% in 2009); the second-best second weekend for an R-rated horror film after It ($60.1 million); and the third-best second weekend for Coogler after Black Panther ($111.6 million in 2018) and its sequel Wakanda Forever ($66.4 million in 2022). Deadline noted that the film's audience had broadened, with women making up 56% of patrons (up from 43% in the first weekend) and those under 25 comprising 34% (up from 20%). The film also made $13.5 million over that frame from 71 foreign markets, a total attributed to word-of-mouth and strong holds in several countries.\nAfter ceding its premium-large format and IMAX screens to newcomer Thunderbolts*, Sinners achieved the best third weekend for a horror film with $33 million (a 28% drop), topping It ($29.7 million). Helped by \"exceptional holds\" in Latin America and Europe, it also made $10.4 million internationally over the weekend. Sinners crossed $200 million domestically in its fourth weekend, becoming the first original film to do so since Coco in 2017.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 411 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"A rip-roaring fusion of masterful visual storytelling and toe-tapping music, writer-director Ryan Coogler's first original blockbuster reveals the full scope of his singular imagination.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale (the highest grade for a horror film in 35 years), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 92% overall positive score, with 84% saying they would definitely recommend the film.\nReviewers praised Coogler's vision and the film's cinematography; Rolling Stone critic A.A. Dowd commented that the director was \"swinging wide and far beyond the boundaries of franchise fare\", while Wendy Ide of The Observer wrote that \"Coogler's assurance and vision holds everything together.\" Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post cited Coogler's \"impressive self-awareness\", as well as Jordan, Mosaku, and Caton's performances. A number of critics suggested that the film's more grounded first half was superior to the supernaturally driven later acts. Peter Travers of ABC News declared Sinners the best movie yet released in 2025, writing that it was Coogler and Jordan's \"best and most daring work yet\". In a more negative review, The Wall Street Journal's Zachary Barnes praised Jordan's performance, but wrote that Sinners did not pull together thematically, arguing that \"Mr. Coogler's imagination remains limited by the conventions of Marveldom.\"\nSho Baraka of Christianity Today notes, \"Just be aware that ... the bawdy themes will tutor you in practices that would make your marriage counselor blush. ... Sinners does speak frankly about the bloodsucking perversion of religion in the United States. But the same plantation folks who suffered hypocrisy knew of a healer who gave joy [that] spawned spirituals, which gave birth to blues.\" Several critics drew comparisons between the film and Robert Rodriguez's 1996 action-horror film From Dusk till Dawn. Coogler cited From Dusk Till Dawn as an inspiration for the film, but compared it more to The Faculty, another film by Rodriguez.\nThe music of Sinners was widely praised by critics, who noted its centrality to the film's story. David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote \"This isn't the first time that a Ludwig Göransson score has been inextricable from the texture of a Ryan Coogler movie, but Sinners opens with someone talking about a kind of music 'so pure it can pierce the veil between life and death, past and future'...and then proceeds to show us exactly what that sounds like.\" Mae Abdulbaki of Screen Rant stated \"The music alone, from the songs played by the characters to the score by Ludwig Göransson, takes the film to another level.\" Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times described the score as \"phenomenal\", adding it is music \"you've never heard and yet it seems to come from deep inside our pop-cultural soul.\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"flavorful [...] with the score and the blues performances fusing together to intoxicating effect.\" Barnes, of The Wall Street Journal, called Göransson's score \"a twangy marvel of genre-crossing interpolation\".\nIn June 2025, IndieWire ranked the film at number 65 on its list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far).\" In July 2025, The Hollywood Reporter ranked it number 16 on its list of the \"25 Best Horror Movies of the 21st Century.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSinners at IMDb",

        "content": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) centers on a series of American superhero films produced by Marvel Studios based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics.

Other individuals have also produced select MCU films, including Gale Anne Hurd for The Incredible Hulk; Amy Pascal for the Spider-Man films; Lauren Shuler Donner, Ryan Reynolds, and Shawn Levy for Deadpool & Wolverine; and Anthony and Joe Russo for Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars.\nMarvel Studios releases its films in groups called \"Phases\". Its first film is Iron Man (2008), which was distributed by Paramount Pictures. Paramount also distributed Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), while Universal Pictures distributed The Incredible Hulk (2008), which was co-produced by Hurd's production company Valhalla Motion Pictures. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures began distributing the series with the crossover film The Avengers (2012), which concluded Phase One. Phase Two comprises Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Ant-Man (2015).\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016) is the first film of Phase Three, and is followed by Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), Captain Marvel (2019), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). The first three Phases are collectively known as \"The Infinity Saga\". The Spider-Man films are owned, financed, and distributed by Sony Pictures and co-produced by Sony's Columbia Pictures and Pascal Pictures.\nPhase Four's group of films began with Black Widow (2021), and was followed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), Eternals (2021), Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). The Phase featured these films, as well as eight television series and two specials for the streaming service Disney+.\nPhase Five began with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), followed by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), The Marvels (2023), Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), Captain America: Brave New World (2025), and Thunderbolts* (2025). This Phase also includes a total of nine seasons of television series for Disney+. Phase Six began with The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025) and will include Spider-Man: Brand New Day (2026), Avengers: Doomsday (2026), and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). The fourth, fifth, and sixth Phases are collectively known as \"The Multiverse Saga\". Deadpool & Wolverine was co-produced by Reynolds's and Levy's respective companies Maximum Effort and 21 Laps Entertainment, while the Russo brothers's company AGBO co-produces Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars.\n\n\n== Development ==\nBy 2005, Marvel Entertainment had begun planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them through Paramount Pictures. In June 2007, Marvel Studios secured funding from a $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. Marvel planned to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover film.\n\nMarvel Studios president Kevin Feige said in November 2013 that releases each year would ideally include one film based on an existing character and one featuring a new character, feeling that would be \"a nice rhythm\", although, this was not always the case as shown by the sequels Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World being released in 2013. Feige elaborated in July 2014 that this model was being followed for 2014 and 2015, and he felt it would be fun to continue. After the reveal that month of multiple release dates for films through 2019, in which some years had three films scheduled, Feige said there was no \"number cruncher\" telling the studio to increase their film output and the change was based on them \"managing [existing] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going.\" After the titles for these films were revealed in October 2014, Feige said the studio was \"firing on all cylinders right now\" and this made them comfortable with increasing to three films a year in 2017 and 2018 without changing their production approach. On the potential for so-called \"superhero fatigue\", Feige stated that, although each film is based on Marvel Comics and feature the \"Marvel Studios\" logo, he believed each film had unique qualities that differentiated them from the others and from non-Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) superhero films. For example, he noted how the studio's 2016 releases, Captain America: Civil War and Doctor Strange, were \"completely different movies\". The studio hoped to continue to surprise audiences and \"not [fall] into things becoming too similar\".\nIn February 2014, Feige said Marvel Studios wanted to mimic the \"rhythm\" of comic book releases by having characters appear in their own films and then come together for crossover events, with Avengers films acting as \"big, giant linchpins\" within the shared universe. On expanding the number of characters in the universe and letting individual films breathe and work on their own, as opposed to having Avenger team-ups outside of Avengers films, Feige said they planned to teach general audiences \"about the notion of the characters existing separately, coming together for specific events and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again. Just like comic readers have been doing for decades... people sort of are accepting that there's just a time when they should be together and there's a time when they're not.\" Discussing how much story is developed for future MCU films, Feige said in September 2015 that \"broad strokes\" and occasionally \"super-specific things\" are determined far in advance. He said there was enough leeway to \"have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up\" and that each film would feel satisfying on its own, but still interconnected to the larger universe and as if it had been planned years ahead of time. The studio has contingency plans for times when they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, and are able to respond to surprises such as the film rights to use Spider-Man becoming available in February 2015.\nFeige discussed moving the MCU to Phase Four in April 2016, reflecting on the first three phases of films and saying, \"I think there will be a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a very different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three Phases.\" Frequent MCU director Joe Russo added that Phase Three was the \"deconstruction Phase\" of the MCU, beginning with Civil War and leading into \"the culmination films\" of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by Phases, saying, \"it might be a new thing\". Feige mentioned that Avengers: Endgame would provide \"a definitive end\" to the films and storylines preceding it, with the franchise having \"two distinct periods. Everything before [Endgame] and everything after\". Many of the films that were planned to follow Endgame were intentionally different from the films in \"The Infinity Saga\", which includes Phase One, Phase Two, and Phase Three.\nIn July 2019, Feige announced the Phase Four slate at San Diego Comic-Con, consisting of films and television event series for the streaming service Disney+. In December 2020, at Disney's Investor Day, Marvel provided updates to previously announced films for the Phase. In late June 2022, Feige said audiences would begin to see where the next saga of the MCU would be heading as Phase Four neared its conclusion, adding that there had been many clues throughout the Phase to what that would be. He said Marvel Studios would be a \"little more direct\" on their future plans in the following months to provide audiences with \"the bigger picture\". In July 2022, Feige unveiled the Phase Five and Six slates at San Diego Comic-Con, similarly consisting of films and Disney+ series, and revealed that these three Phases would make up \"The Multiverse Saga\".\nIn May 2024, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company planned to release two, or at most three, Marvel films a year moving forward, down from four films being released in some recent years, as part of Disney's larger strategy to reduce its content output and focus on quality. At that time, four films were still expected to be released in both 2025 and 2026. Iger said Marvel content would continue to balance sequels with new franchises. Later in 2024, Disney removed the long-in-development film Blade from its 2025 release date and also removed an unspecified Marvel film that was scheduled for July 2026, which was replaced by Sony Pictures's Spider-Man: Brand New Day. Feige said the three films that were still scheduled for 2025 had been in development for a long time and were ready for release. He expected Marvel Studios to start releasing two films a year from 2026, but said there was potential for anywhere between one and three films in some years. In May 2025, Iger called Thunderbolts* the \"first and best example\" of Marvel Studios' refocusing efforts.\nFurther changes to Marvel Studios' release slate resulted in over a year gap between The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025) and Brand New Day; this would be the longest gap between MCU film releases since the gap between Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) and Black Widow (2021), which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2025, Feige said the studio was working to reduce its film budgets, which had increased since Endgame in part due to the pandemic. He said the budgets for their 2024 and 2025 films were a third lower than those for 2022 and 2023. Marvel Studios executives met with the creative team behind the film The Creator (2023) to understand how that film was made with a relatively low $80 million budget. Additionally, Feige stated that Marvel Studios had made a deal to film many of their then-upcoming films at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom, where several of their other films had been previously been shot. He said Marvel Studios anticipated utilizing studio space in Georgia and New York as well, rather than California, because of those states' production tax credits. However, The Wall Street Journal reported that Marvel would largely forego shooting in Georgia because of its rising costs, instead choosing to shoot in the United Kingdom because it had become cheaper to do so. \n\n\n== Films ==\nMarvel Studios releases its films in groups called \"Phases\".\n\n\n=== The Infinity Saga ===\nThe films from Phase One, Phase Two, and Phase Three are collectively known as \"The Infinity Saga\".\n\n\n==== Phase One ====\n\n\n==== Phase Two ====\n\n\n==== Phase Three ====\n\n\n=== The Multiverse Saga ===\nThe films from Phase Four, Phase Five, and Phase Six are collectively known as \"The Multiverse Saga\". The Phases also include multiple series and three specials streaming on Disney+.\n\n\n==== Phase Four ====\n\n\n==== Phase Five ====\n\n\n==== Phase Six ====\n\nDisney has scheduled an additional release date for an unannounced Marvel Studios film on July 23, 2027.\n\n\n=== Future ===\n\nAt any given time, Marvel Studios has future films planned around five to six years out from what they have announced. In July 2025, Feige said they had a seven-year plan through 2032 with potential films on magnets which could be moved around. Marvel Studios was looking to release one to three films a year at that point. After the Multiverse Saga, the next MCU saga is expected to center on characters that Marvel Studios inherited during the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, including the X-Men. Feige reportedly had a 10-year plan for the X-Men in the MCU by then.\nDisney has scheduled release dates for potential Marvel Studios films on February 18, May 5, November 10, and December 15, 2028. In February 2025, producer Nate Moore said work on some projects, such as Armor Wars, had slowed down since the studio began reducing content output and focusing on quality. By that May, Marvel Studios was set to gauge the interest of frequent writer Eric Pearson in projects that were planned for after Avengers: Secret Wars.\n\n\n==== Armor Wars ====\nJames Rhodes must confront one of Tony Stark's greatest fears when Stark's tech falls into the wrong hands.\nIn December 2020, Marvel Studios announced Armor Wars as a Disney+ series based on the comic book storyline of the same name, with Don Cheadle reprising his role as James Rhodes / War Machine. In August 2021, Yassir Lester was hired as the series' head writer. In September 2022, Marvel Studios decided to rework the series into a feature film, with Cheadle and Lester remaining with the project. Development had slowed down by February 2025.\nArmor Wars is set after the events of Secret Invasion (2023). Walton Goggins is set to reprise his role as Sonny Burch from Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018).\n\n\n==== Black Panther 3 ====\n\nBy November 2022, Ryan Coogler and Kevin Feige had discussed a potential third Black Panther film. Two years later, Coogler had had discussions with Denzel Washington about casting him for a role in a third film. Nate Moore, who left Marvel Studios in March 2025, will return to produce the film. In February 2025, Moore confirmed that Coogler would direct the film and said active work would begin later that year, once Coogler completed work on his film Sinners (2025). Coogler confirmed Washington's casting that June.\n\n\n==== Blade ====\n\nFollowing New Line Cinema's Blade film trilogy (1998–2004), Marvel Studios regained the film rights to the character Blade by July 2011 and was developing a new version by May 2013. Mahershala Ali, who played Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes in Marvel Television's Luke Cage (2016–18), approached Marvel Studios in February 2019 about starring in a new Blade film, which Feige announced at San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) that July with Ali as Blade; he first had an uncredited voice cameo in Eternals (2021). Multiple filmmakers were attached in the following years, including directors Bassam Tariq and Yann Demange, while the production experienced several delays. Eric Pearson was rewriting the script by June 2024, when Marvel was searching for a new director, and Blade was removed from the release schedule in October 2024.\n\n\n==== Untitled Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings sequel ====\n\nIn December 2021, a sequel to Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) was announced to be in development, with Destin Daniel Cretton returning to write and direct. Simu Liu was expected to return as Shang-Chi by the following month. In September 2024, Cretton was chosen to direct Spider-Man: Brand New Day (2026), which was a higher priority for Marvel Studios than the Shang-Chi sequel.\n\n\n==== Untitled X-Men film ====\n\nAt SDCC in July 2019, Kevin Feige stated that mutants would eventually be introduced to the MCU, which include the X-Men, and said those terms are interchangeable and that the MCU depiction would differ from 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series. By September 2023, Marvel Studios was preparing to meet with writers for an X-Men film later that year, and Michael Lesslie entered negotiations to write the film in May 2024; he was confirmed to be writing the film a year later. Shortly after, Jake Schreier was announced to direct following positive responses to Thunderbolts* (2025). After bringing back actors from Fox's X-Men films for the Multiverse Saga, Feige said this film would feature a recast X-Men team following the \"reset\" of the MCU in Secret Wars. He said it would be \"a very youth-oriented, focused and cast movie\".\n\n\n==== Other ====\nMarvel Studios is working on an unknown project with Scarlett Johansson, who will serve as a producer. The project was still being developed by mid-June 2023, when work was paused due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. By May 2025, Ryan Reynolds had begun working on various script treatments for an ensemble film centered on \"three or four\" X-Men characters alongside Deadpool. The Hollywood Reporter reported that using Deadpool in a supporting role would allow the X-Men characters \"to be used in unexpected ways\" and that Reynolds was working independently of Marvel Studios for the time being to figure out the film's concept. In June, a sequel to The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025) was reported to be in development.\n\n\n== Recurring cast and characters ==\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical distribution ===\nOver time, the distribution rights to Marvel Studios' films have changed hands on multiple occasions. In November 2006, Universal Pictures announced that it would distribute The Incredible Hulk (2008), in an arrangement separate from Marvel's 2005 deal with Paramount, which was distributing Marvel's other films. In September 2008, after the international success of Iron Man (2008), Paramount signed a deal to have worldwide distribution rights for Iron Man 2 (2010), Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and The Avengers (2012).\nIn late December 2009, the Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. Additionally, in October 2010, Walt Disney Studios bought the distribution rights for The Avengers and Iron Man 3 from Paramount Pictures, with Paramount's logo remaining on the films, as well as for promotional material and merchandise, although Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures is the only studio credited at the end of these films. Disney has distributed all subsequent Marvel Studios films. In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger from Paramount. The Incredible Hulk was not part of the deal at the time, due to an agreement between Marvel and Universal, where Marvel owns the film rights and Universal owns the distribution rights, for this film as well as the right of first refusal to distribute future Hulk films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not bought the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Disney wants for its own theme parks. In June 2023, the distribution rights to The Incredible Hulk reverted from Universal back to Marvel Studios and Disney.\n\n\n==== Spider-Man films ====\nIn February 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Marvel Studios announced a licensing deal that would allow Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character first appearing in Captain America: Civil War. Spider-Man films produced by Marvel Studios would continue to be financed, distributed, and controlled by Sony Pictures. In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal does not apply to the MCU television series, as it was \"very specific ... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed\". Both studios have the ability to terminate the agreement at any point, and no money was exchanged with the deal. However, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal formed between the two studios (where Marvel gained full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for making a one-time payment of $175 million to Sony and paying up to $35 million for each future Spider-Man film, and forgoing receiving their previous 5% of any Spider-Man film's revenue), with Marvel getting to reduce their $35 million payment to Sony if Spider-Man: Homecoming grossed more than $750 million. Marvel Studios still received 5% of first dollar gross for the film. Sony also paid Marvel Studios an undisclosed producer fee for Homecoming.\nIn August 2019, it was reported that Disney and Sony could not reach a new agreement regarding Spider-Man films, with Marvel Studios and Feige said to no longer have any involvement in future films. Deadline Hollywood noted that Disney had hoped future films would be a \"50/50 co-financing arrangement between the studios\", with the possibility to extend the deal to other Spider-Man-related films, an offer Sony rejected and did not counter. Instead, Sony hoped to keep the terms of the previous agreement (Marvel receiving 5% of the film's first dollar gross), with Disney refusing. The Hollywood Reporter added that the lack of a new agreement would see the end of Holland's Spider-Man in the MCU. Variety cited unnamed sources claiming negotiations had \"hit an impasse\" and that a new deal could still be reached. In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) as the third film co-produced by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures and a future Marvel Studios film. Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.\nIn November 2021, producer Amy Pascal revealed that Sony and Marvel Studios were planning to make at least three more Spider-Man films starring Holland, with work on the first of those films getting ready to begin. However, The Hollywood Reporter noted that there were no official plans for a new trilogy, despite the strong working relationship between the studios. The following month, Feige said that he, Pascal, Disney, and Sony were \"actively beginning to develop\" the next Spider-Man story, assuring that there would not be any \"separation trauma\" that occurred between Far From Home and No Way Home. Sony's agreement specifies that production has to start on a film within three years and nine months of the previous one, and release within five years and nine months, otherwise the rights revert to Marvel.\nMarvel Studios explored opportunities to integrate other characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into their Spider-Man films, with Robert Downey Jr. reprising his role as Tony Stark / Iron Man in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Samuel L. Jackson reprising his role as Nick Fury in Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange in No Way Home. Jon Bernthal and Mark Ruffalo are expected to appear as their respective MCU characters Frank Castle and Bruce Banner / Hulk in Spider-Man: Brand New Day (2026). Aaron Couch and Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter compared this to the Marvel Team-Up comic books which feature Spider-Man teaming-up with different heroes.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\n\n\n==== Physical ====\nIn June 2012, Marvel announced a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\", for release on September 25, 2012. The box set includes all six of the Phase One films—Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, and The Avengers—on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D, in a replica of Nick Fury's briefcase from The Avengers. In August 2012, luggage company Rimowa GmbH, who developed the briefcase for The Avengers, filed suit against Marvel Studios and Buena Vista Home Entertainment in U.S. federal court, complaining that \"Marvel did not obtain any license or authorization from Rimowa to make replica copies of the cases for any purpose.\" The set was delayed to early 2013 for the packaging to be redesigned. The box set, with a redesigned case, was released on April 2, 2013. In addition, the box set included a featurette on the then-upcoming Phase Two films, showing footage and concept art, as well as previously unreleased deleted scenes from all of the Phase One films.\nIn July 2015, Marvel announced a 13-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\", for release on December 8, 2015, exclusive to Amazon.com. The box set includes all six of the Phase Two films—Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Ant-Man—on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and a digital copy, in a replica of the Orb from Guardians of the Galaxy, plus a bonus disc and exclusive memorabilia. Material on the bonus disc includes all of the Marvel One-Shots with commentary, deleted scenes and pre-production creative features for each of the films, featurettes on the making of the post-credit scenes for the films, and first looks at Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\nIn September 2019, Feige indicated a box set with all 23 films of \"The Infinity Saga\" would be released, with the set including previously unreleased deleted scenes and other footage, such as an alternate take of the Nick Fury post-credits scene from Iron Man which references Spider-Man, the Hulk, and the X-Men. The box set, featuring all 23 films on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray, a bonus disc, a letter from Feige, and a lithograph art piece by Matt Ferguson, was released on November 15, 2019, exclusively at Best Buy.\n\n\n==== Streaming and cable ====\nIn March 2008, Marvel Studios presold the US cable broadcast rights to FX for five of their films, including Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, for four years. FX also acquired the rights to Iron Man 3 in May 2013. In September 2014, TNT acquired the US cable broadcast rights to five Marvel Studios films, beginning with Avengers: Age of Ultron, for broadcast two years after their theatrical release.\nEvery Marvel Studios release from January 2016 to December 2018 was available on Netflix. Captain Marvel was the first Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures-distributed film not to stream on Netflix, after Disney let their licensing deal with them expire. It became the first theatrical Disney release to stream exclusively on Disney+, which launched on November 12, 2019. Bloomberg News reported that the films part of Disney's agreement with Netflix would return to Netflix starting in 2026, while being removed from Disney+.\nIn April 2021, Sony signed a deal with Disney for its theatrical releases from 2022 to 2026 to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks for their \"pay 2 window\". As well, Sony's legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU), would be able to be streamed on Disney+ and Hulu. Disney's access to Sony's titles would come following their availability on Netflix for their \"pay 1 window\". Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) had previously been available on Starz and FX. Homecoming became available on Disney+ in the United States on May 12, 2023, while Far From Home became available on November 3, 2023. The Incredible Hulk became available on Disney+ in the United States on June 16, 2023, following the film's distribution rights reverting to Marvel Studios.\n\n\n=== IMAX 10th anniversary festival ===\nFrom August 30 to September 6, 2018, in conjunction with Marvel Studios' 10-year anniversary celebrations, all 20 films released at the time (Iron Man through Ant-Man and the Wasp) were screened in IMAX. The films were shown in release order, with four films per day. The final days of the festival were theme-related, with one showing \"origin\" films (Iron Man, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Black Panther, and Doctor Strange), one showing \"team-ups\" (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Captain America: Civil War, The Avengers, and Avengers: Infinity War), and the final day showing Iron Man and The Avengers as chosen by the fans via a Twitter poll. The festival also saw Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Captain America: The First Avenger released in IMAX for the first time.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office performance ===\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time worldwide, both unadjusted and adjusted-for-inflation, having grossed over $32.4 billion at the global box office. Several of its sub-series such as the Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Spider-Man film series are among the most successful film series of all time. From July 2019 to March 2021, Avengers: Endgame was the highest-grossing film of all time. With the release of Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), the MCU became the first film franchise to cross $30 billion.\n\n\n=== Critical and public response ===\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nThe films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have been nominated for numerous awards, including 27 Academy Awards (winning four).\n\n\n== Repurposed projects ==\n\nThese projects were in development as films from Marvel Studios before becoming television series under Marvel Television:\n\nRunaways: A film based on the Runaways went through a number of iterations. Brian K. Vaughan was originally hired to write a screenplay based on the property in May 2008. Feige and Marvel Studios producer Jodi Hildebrand envisioned the film as a coming-of-age story in the style of director John Hughes. In April 2010, Marvel hired Peter Sollett to direct the film, and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May. The film was developed under the working title Small Faces, referencing the 1960s rock band Small Faces. In October 2010, development on the film was put on hold, with Vaughan later noting Marvel Studios had decided to focus their efforts on a Guardians of the Galaxy film instead. Pearce revealed in September 2013 that the Runaways film had been shelved in favor of The Avengers, with the earliest it could release being Phase Three. Speaking in the book MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios (2023), producer Craig Kyle noted that the film had been shelved because the New York-based Creative Committee did not believe the film's character make up fit their ideal demographic of what would help sell toys. In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without Runaways, Feige stated the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault\", adding, \"We'd love to do something with Runaways some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all.\" In August 2016, Marvel Television announced Marvel's Runaways from the streaming service Hulu, with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017. It premiered in November 2017. Hulu announced in November 2019 that the third season of Runaways would be its last.\nInhumans: In April 2013, Feige mentioned the Inhumans as a property out of which he was \"confident\" a film would be made. Inhumans as a concept would first be introduced to the MCU in 2014 through the second season of the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. By August 2014, the studio was ready to move forward in development with the film, with a screenplay written by Joe Robert Cole. In October 2014, the film was announced for Phase Three and scheduled for release in July 2019. By October 2015, Cole was no longer involved with the film and any potential drafts that he may have written would not be used. In April 2016, Inhumans was removed from the release schedule, and would no longer be a part of Phase Three. In July 2016, Feige said Inhumans would \"certainly\" be a part of the discussion regarding the film ideas for 2020 and 2021, adding the following November that he was still optimistic the film could be released in Phase Four. In November 2016, Marvel Television announced the series Marvel's Inhumans, which premiered on ABC in September 2017, after the first two episodes were screened in IMAX. The series was not intended to be a reworking of the film. ABC canceled Inhumans after one season in May 2018.\n\n\n== Connections with other Spider-Man franchises ==\n\nFollowing Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures' September 2019 agreement, Feige noted that as Sony continued to separately build their own shared universe, Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU), it was possible the MCU version of Spider-Man could appear in that universe. This interaction was said to be \"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what ... would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\". In May 2021, Adam B. Vary of Variety called the connections between the two universes perplexing, specifically because if Holland were to appear in an SSU film it would retroactively make any previous SSU films part of the MCU, and because a teaser trailer for the SSU film Morbius (2022) had featured Michael Keaton, who previously played Adrian Toomes / Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Sony Pictures Group President Sanford Panitch acknowledged this confusion and said there was a plan to clarify the relationship between the two universes. He believed it was already \"getting a little more clear for people [as to] where we're headed\" at that time and added that the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home in December 2021 would reveal more of this plan. Vary commented that the apparent introduction of multiverse elements in No Way Home could be what would allow Holland to appear in both the MCU and the SSU. The following month, Feige said he would not \"rule anything out completely\" in terms of additional Sony-controlled characters appearing in Marvel Studios films.\nIn No Way Home, Stephen Strange casts two spells: one that brings characters from other universes into the MCU and one that sends them back to their own universes. These characters, as depicted in the film, are Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield returning as their versions of Spider-Man from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films, respectively, alongside Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman from the Raimi films, as well as Rhys Ifans as Curt Connors / Lizard and Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon / Electro from the Webb films. The mid-credits scene of the SSU film Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) shows Eddie Brock and Venom (Tom Hardy) being transported into the MCU from their universe by the first spell and the mid-credits scene of No Way Home shows them being transported back to their own universe by the second spell. A small part of the Venom symbiote is left in the MCU. Feige said there was a lot of coordination between the Let There Be Carnage and No Way Home teams to create the two scenes, with No Way Home director Jon Watts directing both scenes during production of that film. The mid-credits scenes of Morbius revealed that Toomes was accidentally transported from the MCU to the SSU following Strange's second spell. The events of No Way Home are referenced in the animated film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023), which refers to the MCU as \"Earth-199999\". In July 2025, Feige said Sony had told Marvel Studios to \"stay away\" from Miles Morales, the main character of the animated Spider-Verse film series, until Sony had finished making those films.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series\nList of films based on Marvel Comics publications\nList of highest-grossing media franchises\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "title": "Ghislaine Maxwell",
        "content": "Ghislaine Noelle Marion Maxwell ( ghee-LAYN, ghee-LEN; born 25 December 1961) is a British former socialite and a convicted sex offender. In 2021, she was found guilty of child sex trafficking and other offences in connection with the deceased financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The following year, she was sentenced in federal court in New York City to 20 years of imprisonment.\nBorn in France and raised in Oxford, England, she attended Balliol College, Oxford, in the 1980s and became a prominent member of London's social scene. She is a naturalised American citizen and retains both French and British citizenship. Maxwell worked for her father, Robert Maxwell, until his death in 1991; she then moved to New York City, where she continued living as a socialite and had a relationship with Epstein. Maxwell founded the non-profit TerraMar Project for the protection of oceans in 2012. In July 2019, after prosecutors brought sex trafficking allegations against Epstein, the organisation ceased operations.\nMaxwell was arrested and charged by the federal government of the United States in July 2020 with the crimes of enticement of minors and sex trafficking of underage girls, related to her association with Epstein as his recruiter. She was denied bail as a flight risk, with the judge expressing concerns regarding her \"completely opaque\" finances, her skill at living in hiding, and the fact that France does not extradite its citizens. She was convicted on five out of six counts, including one of sex trafficking of a minor, in December 2021. She faces a second criminal trial for two charges of lying under oath about Epstein's abuse of underage girls.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGhislaine Maxwell was born on 25 December 1961, in Maisons-Laffitte, Île-de-France, France, the ninth and youngest child of Elisabeth (née Meynard), a French-born scholar, and Robert Maxwell (né Ján Ludvík Hyman Binyamin Hoch), a Czechoslovak-born British media proprietor. Her father was from a Jewish family, and her mother was of Huguenot (French Protestant) descent. Maxwell was born two days before a car accident that left her fifteen-year-old brother Michael in a prolonged coma until he died in 1967. Her mother later reflected that the accident had an effect on the entire family, and surmised that Ghislaine had shown signs of anorexia while only a toddler.\n\nThroughout childhood, Maxwell lived with her family in Oxford at Headington Hill Hall, a 53-room mansion, where the offices of Pergamon Press, a publishing company run by her father, were also located. Her mother said that all her children were raised as Anglicans. Maxwell first attended Oxford High School for Girls in North Oxford and then, at age nine, was enrolled at Edgarley Hall preparatory school in Somerset, followed by Headington School at age 13. She attended Marlborough College to study for A-Levels, before going on to earn a degree in Modern History with Languages from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1985. While at Balliol she fraternised with Boris Johnson and Anna Pasternak.\nMaxwell had a close relationship with her father and was reportedly his favourite. According to Tatler, Maxwell recalled that her father installed computers at Headington in 1973 and her first job was training to use a Wang 2200 and later programming code. The Times reported that he did not permit her to bring her boyfriends home or to be seen with them publicly, after she started attending Oxford University.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nMaxwell was a prominent figure in the London social scene of the 1980s. She founded a women's club named after the original Kit-Cat Club and was a director of Oxford United Football Club during her father's ownership. She also worked at The European, a publication her father had established. According to Tom Bower, writing for The Sunday Times, in 1986, Robert invited her to the naming in her honour of his new yacht the Lady Ghislaine, at a shipyard in the Netherlands. She spent a large amount of time in the late 1980s aboard the yacht, which was equipped with a jacuzzi, sauna, gym, and disco. The Scotsman said Robert had also \"tailor-made a New York company for her\". The company, which was engaged in corporate gifts, was not profitable.\nThe Sunday Times reported that Maxwell flew to New York City on 5 November 1990 to deliver an envelope on her father's behalf that, unbeknownst to her, was part of \"a plot initiated by her father to steal $200m\" from Berlitz shareholders.\nAfter Robert Maxwell purchased the New York Daily News in January 1991, he sent Ghislaine to New York City to act as his emissary. This furnished her entry to the Manhattan social scene. In May 1991, Maxwell and her father took the Concorde on business to New York, from where he soon departed for Moscow and left her to represent his interests at an event honouring Simon Wiesenthal.\nIn November 1991, Robert Maxwell's body was found floating in the sea near the Canary Islands and Lady Ghislaine. Soon afterwards, Ghislaine flew to Tenerife, where the yacht was berthed, to attend to his business paperwork. She attended her father's funeral in Jerusalem alongside Israeli intelligence figures, president Chaim Herzog, and prime minister Yitzhak Shamir, who delivered the eulogy. Although a verdict of death by accidental drowning was recorded, Maxwell has since said she believes her father was murdered, commenting in 1997: \"He did not commit suicide. That was just not consistent with his character. I think he was murdered.\"\nAfter his death, Robert Maxwell was found to have fraudulently appropriated the pension assets of Mirror Group Newspapers, a company that he ran and in which he held a large share of ownership, to support its share price. Pension funds over £400m were said to be missing, and 32,000 people were affected. Two of Maxwell's brothers, Ian and Kevin, who were the most involved with their father in daily business dealings, were arrested on 19 June 1992 and charged with fraud related to the Mirror Group pension scandal. The brothers were acquitted three and a half years later in January 1996.\nMaxwell moved to the United States in 1991, shortly after her father's death. It is reported that, owing to social discomfort she experienced in the wake of the pension fraud perpetrated by her father, she purchased a one-way Concorde ticket to New York in November 1992. Maxwell was provided with an annual income of £80,000 (equivalent to £216,935 in 2023) from a trust fund established in Liechtenstein by her father. By 1992, she had moved to an apartment of an Iranian friend overlooking Central Park. At the time, Maxwell worked at a real estate office on Madison Avenue and was reported to be socialising with celebrities. She quickly rose to wider prominence as a New York City socialite. In 1996, Maxwell made headlines when she was arrested for drunk driving; the media reported her occupation as \"internet operative\".\n\n\n== Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein ==\n\nAccounts differ on when Maxwell first met American financier Jeffrey Epstein. According to Epstein's former business partner, Steven Hoffenberg, Robert Maxwell introduced his daughter to Epstein in the late 1980s. The Times reported that Maxwell met Epstein in the early 1990s at a New York party following \"a difficult break-up with Count Gianfranco Cicogna\" (1962–2012) of the CIGA Hotels clan.\nMaxwell and Epstein were associated with each other by February 1993. In 1995, Maxwell and Epstein were guests of honour on a cruise organised by Lindsay Fox who had invited Rodney Adler and wife Lindi as well as James Packer and then-girlfriend Deni Hines.\nMaxwell had a romantic relationship with Epstein for several years in the early 1990s and remained closely associated with him for more than 25 years until his death in 2019. The nature of their relationship remains unclear, although at trial, prosecutors said that from 1994 to 1997 they were engaged in an intimate relationship. A 22 January 2001 article by Nigel Rosser of the Evening Standard reported that friends of Epstein said Maxwell \"remains desperate to marry Epstein\", further elaborating: \"You could say she was pretty much entirely dependent on him. She loves him. He sometimes treats her well, sometimes off-handedly. You could say she sees something of a father in him.\" In a 2009 deposition, several of Epstein's household employees testified that Epstein referred to her as his \"main girlfriend\" who also hired, fired, and supervised his staff, starting around 1992. She has also been referred to as the \"Lady of the House\" by Epstein's staff and as his \"aggressive assistant\". In a 2003 Vanity Fair profile on Epstein, author Vicky Ward said Epstein referred to Maxwell as \"my best friend\". Ward also observed that Maxwell seemed \"to organize much of his life\".\nPolitico reported that Maxwell and Epstein had friendships with several prominent individuals in elite circles of politics, academia, business, and law, including President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, attorney Alan Dershowitz, and Prince Andrew, Duke of York.\nMaxwell is known for her longstanding friendship with Prince Andrew, and for having escorted him to a \"hookers and pimps\" social function in New York. In a November 2019 interview with the BBC, Andrew said that the two had known each other since Maxwell was an undergraduate at Oxford. She introduced Epstein to Prince Andrew, and the three often socialised together. In 2000, Maxwell and Epstein attended a party thrown by Prince Andrew at the Queen's Sandringham House estate in Norfolk, reportedly for Maxwell's 39th birthday. In his November 2019 interview with the BBC, Prince Andrew confirmed that Maxwell and Epstein had attended an event at his invitation, but he denied that it was anything more than a \"straightforward shooting weekend\".\nIn 1995, Epstein renamed one of his companies the Ghislaine Corporation; based in Palm Beach, Florida, the company was dissolved in 1998. As a trained helicopter pilot, Maxwell also transported Epstein to his private Caribbean island.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution and served 13 months of an 18-month prison sentence. Following Epstein's release, although Maxwell continued to attend prominent social functions, she and Epstein were no longer seen together publicly.\nAlthough in 2013 Maxwell was an honoured guest at the Clinton Global Initiative conference, by late 2015 she had largely retreated from attending social functions.\n\n\n== Civil cases and accusations ==\n\n\n=== Civil suits ===\n\n\n==== Virginia Giuffre v Maxwell (2015) ====\nDetails of a civil lawsuit, made public in January 2015, contained a deposition from \"Jane Doe 3\" that accused Maxwell of recruiting her in 1999, when she was a minor, and grooming her to provide sexual services for Epstein:\n\n In court documents, Epstein's accusers allege that Maxwell acted as a recruiter, an instructor, and in some cases a participant in the abuse he practiced. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims that Maxwell recruited her on behalf of Epstein when Giuffre was a 16-year-old spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, where Epstein has a home, said much of her grooming came from Maxwell herself. \"The training started immediately\", she said in a video interview with the Miami Herald. \"It was everything down to how to give a blowjob, how to be quiet, be subservient, give Jeffrey what he wants. A lot of this training came from Ghislaine herself. Being a woman, it kind of surprises you that a woman could let stuff like that happen. Not only let it happen but to groom you into doing it.\"\nA 2018 exposé by Julie K. Brown in the Miami Herald revealed Jane Doe 3 to be Virginia Giuffre, who was previously known as Virginia Roberts. Giuffre met Maxwell at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, when Giuffre was a 16-year-old spa attendant. She asserted that Maxwell had introduced her to Epstein, after which she was \"groomed by the two [of them] for his pleasure, including lessons in Epstein's preferences during oral sex\".\nMaxwell repeatedly denied any involvement in Epstein's crimes. In a 2015 statement, Maxwell rejected allegations that she had acted as a procurer for Epstein and denied that she had \"facilitated Prince Andrew's [alleged] acts of sexual abuse\". Her spokesperson said \"the allegations made against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue\" and she \"strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British press and elsewhere, and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims\".\nGiuffre asserted that Maxwell and Epstein had trafficked her and other underage girls, often at sex parties hosted by Epstein at his homes in New York, New Mexico, Palm Beach, and the United States Virgin Islands. Maxwell called her a liar. Giuffre sued Maxwell for defamation in federal court in the Southern District of New York in 2015. While details of the settlement have not been made public, in May 2017 the case was settled in Giuffre's favour, with Maxwell paying Giuffre \"millions\".\nGiuffre's family reported that she committed suicide on 25 April 2025, at her farm in Australia. She was 41, and had three children.\n\n\n==== Sarah Ransome v Epstein and Maxwell (2017) ====\nIn 2017, Sarah Ransome filed a suit, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, against Epstein and Maxwell, alleging that Maxwell hired her to give massages to Epstein and later threatened to physically harm her or destroy her career prospects if she did not comply with their sexual demands at his mansion in New York and on his private Caribbean island of Little Saint James, in the United States Virgin Islands. The suit was settled in 2018 under undisclosed terms.\n\n\n==== Affidavit filed by Maria Farmer (2019) ====\nOn 16 April 2019, Maria Farmer went public and filed a sworn affidavit in federal court in New York, alleging that she and her 15-year-old sister, Annie, had been sexually assaulted by Epstein and Maxwell in separate locations in 1996. Farmer's affidavit was filed in support of a defamation suit by Virginia Giuffre against Alan Dershowitz. According to the affidavit, Farmer had met Maxwell and Epstein at a New York art gallery reception in 1995. The affidavit says that in the summer of the following year, they hired her to work on an art project in billionaire businessman Leslie Wexner's Ohio mansion, where she was then sexually assaulted by both Maxwell and Epstein. Farmer reported the incident to the New York Police Department and the FBI. Her affidavit also stated that during the same summer, Epstein flew Annie to his New Mexico property where he and Maxwell molested her on a massage table.\nFarmer was interviewed for CBS This Morning in November 2019 where she detailed the 1996 assault and said that Maxwell had repeatedly threatened both her career and her life after the assault. In 2025, Farmer sued the federal government in the US District Court for the District of Columbia for failing to protect her and other victims.\n\n\n==== Jennifer Araoz v Epstein's estate, Maxwell, and Jane Does 1–3 (2019) ====\nOn 14 August 2019, Jennifer Araoz filed a lawsuit in the New York County Supreme Court against Epstein's estate, Maxwell, and three unnamed members of his staff; the lawsuit was made possible under New York State's new Child Victims Act, which took effect on the same date. Araoz later amended her complaint on 8 October 2019 with the names of the previously unidentified women enablers to include Lesley Groff, Cimberly Espinosa, and the late Rosalyn Fontanilla.\n\n\n==== Priscilla Doe v Epstein's estate (2019) ====\nGhislaine Maxwell was named in one of three lawsuits filed in New York on 20 August 2019 against the estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The woman filing the suit, identified as \"Priscilla Doe\", claimed that she was recruited in 2006 and trained by Maxwell with step-by-step instructions on how to provide sexual services for Epstein.\n\n\n==== Annie Farmer v Maxwell and Epstein's Estate (2019) ====\nAnnie Farmer, represented by David Boies, sued Maxwell and Epstein's estate in Federal District Court in Manhattan in November 2019, accusing them of rape, battery, and false imprisonment and seeking unspecified damages.\n\n\n==== Jane Doe v Maxwell and Epstein's Estate (2020) ====\nIn January 2020, a lawsuit was filed against Maxwell and Epstein alleging that they recruited a 13-year-old music student at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in the summer of 1994 and subjected her to sexual abuse. The suit states that Jane Doe was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Epstein over a four-year period and that Maxwell played a key role both in her recruitment and by participating in the assaults. According to the lawsuit, Jane Doe was targeted by Epstein and Maxwell for being fatherless and from a struggling family, in much the same manner as many of the other alleged victims.\n\n\n==== Maxwell v Epstein's Estate, Darren K. Indyke, Richard D. Kahn, and NES LLC (2020) ====\nOn 12 March 2020, Maxwell filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands seeking compensation from Epstein's estate for her legal costs. Maxwell claimed she had been a longtime employee of Epstein (from 1998 to 2006) who had served to manage his property holdings in the US Virgin Islands, New York, New Mexico, Florida and Paris while continuing to deny any knowledge or involvement in his criminal activities. According to the lawsuit, Maxwell was seeking damages for the legal fees associated with defending herself against her accusers, expenses that she claims Epstein had promised to cover for her.\n\n\n==== Jane Doe v Epstein's estate (2021) ====\nMaxwell was named in a civil suit filed against Epstein's estate in March 2021 by a Broward County woman who accused Epstein and Maxwell of trafficking her after repeatedly raping her in Florida in 2008.\n\n\n=== Dispute over release of court documents ===\nOn 2 July 2019, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the unsealing of documents from the earlier civil suit against Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre. Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on 6 July 2019 at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Maxwell requested a rehearing in a federal appeals court on 17 July 2019, in an effort to keep documents sealed that were part of a suit by Giuffre. On 9 August 2019, the first batch of documents was unsealed and released from the earlier defamation suit by Giuffre against Maxwell. Epstein was found dead on 10 August 2019, after reportedly hanging himself in his Manhattan prison cell.\nMaxwell and her lawyers continued to argue against the further release of court documents in December 2019. Reuters confirmed on 27 December 2019 that Maxwell was under investigation by the FBI for facilitating Epstein's criminal activities. Additional documents from the Giuffre v Maxwell defamation suit were released on 30 July 2020. The documents included a deposition given by Giuffre and more recent email exchanges between Maxwell and Epstein, with some of the correspondence from 2015.\nOn 3 January 2024, over 900 pages of previously sealed documents relating to Giuffre's civil case against Maxwell were made public following litigation by the Miami Herald; further documents were released on 4 January.\n\n\n=== Attempts to locate Maxwell to serve court documents ===\nOn 27 December 2019, Reuters reported that Maxwell was among those under FBI investigation for facilitating Epstein. After his arrest, Maxwell was in hiding, communicating with the courts only through her lawyers who, as of 30 January 2020, had refused to accept on her behalf service of three lawsuits against her. The New York Times reported that by 2016, Maxwell was no longer being photographed at events. By 2017, her lawyers claimed before a judge that they did not know her address; they further stated that she was in London but they did not believe she had a permanent residence.\nMaxwell has a history of being unreachable during legal proceedings. During the lawsuit filed in 2017 from Ransome against Maxwell, District Judge John G. Koeltl granted a motion for \"alternative service\" on the grounds that the plaintiff's efforts to reach Maxwell were persistently thwarted; these included hiring a private investigation firm that attempted service at three physical addresses, sending information to several email addresses, and reaching out to the lawyers actively representing Maxwell in another lawsuit who refused to become a \"general agent of process\" to relay the information to her.\nAccording to court documents from a lawsuit filed by Epstein against Bradley Edwards (a representative for several of his accusers), in 2010 Maxwell had agreed to provide a deposition in the case but reportedly left the country one day before Edwards was scheduled to fly to New York to take her deposition, \"claiming she needed to return to the United Kingdom to be with her deathly ill mother\" with no intention of returning to the United States. However, Maxwell returned within a month to attend Chelsea Clinton's wedding.\nIn January 2020, it was reported that Maxwell had refused to allow her lawyers to be served with several lawsuits in which she has been directly named in 2019 and 2020, including one by Farmer and from Araoz. While Maxwell's lawyers continued to argue on her behalf against the release of additional court documents from the Giuffre v Maxwell lawsuit, they claimed to not know where she was or to have permission to accept the lawsuits filed against her.\nAuthorities in the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) were unsuccessful in locating Maxwell during the three and a half months they were seeking to serve her with a subpoena. USVI prosecutors consider Maxwell to be a \"critical fact witness\" in their lawsuit against Epstein's estate. A court filing from the USVI Department of Justice, released on 10 July 2020, stated that Maxwell was also under investigation for her alleged participation in Epstein's sex trafficking operation in the US Virgin Islands.\n\n\n== Criminal charges and aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Arrest and indictment ===\nMaxwell faced persistent allegations of procuring and sexually trafficking underage girls for Epstein and others, charges she denied. Maxwell was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire by the FBI on 2 July 2020, through the use of an IMSI-catcher (\"stingray\") mobile phone tracking device on a phone used by her to call her husband Scott Borgerson, her sister Isabel, and one of her lawyers.\nProsecutors, led by United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Audrey Strauss, charged Maxwell with six federal crimes, including enticement of minors, sex trafficking of children, and perjury. The indictment charged that between 1994 and 1997, she \"assisted, facilitated, and contributed\" to the abuse of minor girls despite knowing that one of three unnamed victims was 14 years old.\nAmong her supporters was then US President Donald Trump, who said in July 2020: \"I just wish her well.\" In an interview two weeks later with Axios he returned to the subject telling Jonathan Swan that \"Yeah, I wish her well. I’d wish you well. I’d wish a lot of people well. Good luck. Let them prove somebody was guilty.\"\nAs of 28 April 2021, Maxwell was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, New York. Lawyers requested that Judge Nathan release her on $5 million bond with monitored home confinement while awaiting trial. Maxwell appeared by video link before a court in Manhattan on 14 July 2020 and pleaded not guilty to the charges. A naturalised US citizen since 2002 who also holds passports from France and the United Kingdom, Maxwell was denied bail as a flight risk amid concerns regarding her \"completely opaque\" finances, her skill at living in hiding, and the fact that France does not extradite its citizens. The judge set a trial date of 12 July 2021.\nMaxwell's attorney reiterated her request for bail on 18 December 2020, and proposed that Maxwell reside with a friend in New York City while under 24-hour surveillance as she awaited trial. Her husband, Scott Borgerson, made a secured offer of US$22 million to guarantee her presence at future appearances. On 28 December 2020, a further request for bail was again rejected by the judge. Maxwell's bail request was opposed by alleged victim Annie Farmer.\nOn 19 January 2021, a court hearing was disrupted by believers in QAnon – who believe Maxwell to be working in cohort with a cabal of child-sacrificing Satanist liberal elites who traffic children for sex – as the proceedings were illegally livestreamed to YouTube.\nOn 26 January 2021, a motion by Maxwell's attorneys challenged her grand jury indictment, claiming that it did not reflect the ethnic diversity of the jurisdiction in which the violations of the law were alleged to have occurred.\nOn 29 March 2021, US prosecutors added new charges of sex trafficking a minor and sex trafficking conspiracy, alleging that Maxwell was involved in grooming a fourth girl, aged 14, to engage in sexual acts with Epstein between 2001 and 2004 at his residence in Palm Beach. Maxwell pleaded not guilty to the additional charges; she faced six counts that included sex trafficking of a minor and sex trafficking conspiracy, in addition to two counts of perjury.\nMaxwell's attorneys regularly protested about the conditions of her confinement, which included being kept awake by a light shone in her eyes every fifteen minutes to deter the chances of her committing suicide, and being denied a sleep mask. One, David Markus, protested, \"There's no evidence she's suicidal. They're doing it because Jeffrey Epstein died on their watch\", and \"She's not Jeffrey Epstein, this isn't right\". She had as of November 2021 spent more than 500 days in solitary confinement.\n\n\n=== Sex-trafficking trial ===\nIn April 2021, US District Judge Alison Nathan ruled that Maxwell would face two separate trials, one for the sex trafficking charges and another for perjury. Nathan delayed the first trial to 29 November 2021 after Maxwell's defence lawyers successfully argued that the new charges added in March 2021 did not give them enough time to prepare for trial. Maxwell appeared in court on 15 November 2021. The trial commenced on 29 November with opening statements. Twelve jurors had been picked, plus six alternates, from a pool of forty to sixty people.\nProsecutor Lara Pomerantz and Audrey Strauss chose to focus on four out of more than 100 victims. One girl, who was presented to the courtroom as \"Jane\", testified that Maxwell and Epstein had preyed upon her as she attended summer arts camp in 1994. The two predators set up a pyramid scheme in which they would reward with additional money vulnerable girls who brought to them another vulnerable girl. The girls were essentially turned into prostitutes for hire by a \"grooming playbook\". Of the four witnesses only one, Annie Farmer, chose to identify herself. Juan Alessi, Epstein's concierge in Manhattan, provided some of the most damning testimony. The prosecutors said she was hired by Epstein and used these \"means to support her lifestyle\".\nMaxwell chose not to testify, telling the judge \"Your honour, the government has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. So there is no need for me to testify.\" She was represented by Jeff Pagliuca. A spokesperson for Maxwell's family had previously said she was \"too fragile\" to testify. Psychology professor Elizabeth Loftus was called as an expert witness for the defence and provided testimony on false memory syndrome.\nIn early December 2021, Twitter suspended the account \"@TrackerTrial\", an account monitoring Maxwell's trial. The account was two weeks old and had 525,000 followers before its suspension.\nOn 28 December, as infections from COVID-19 rose in the city, judge Nathan extended the jury's sitting times, as she was concerned that juror infections would raise the possibility of a mistrial.\n\n\n==== Conviction and appeals ====\n\nOn 29 December 2021, Maxwell was convicted by a jury in US federal court on five sex trafficking-related counts carrying a potential custodial sentence of up to 65 years' imprisonment: one of sex trafficking of a minor (maximum: 40 years), one of transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity (10 years) and three of conspiracy to commit choate felonies (15 years total).\nMaxwell was acquitted on the charge of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts. Maxwell's family said the appeal process had begun.\nThe only witness to use her real name during her testimony, Annie Farmer, spoke out after the trial saying, \"I hope that this verdict brings solace to all who need it ... Even those with great power and privilege will be held accountable when they sexually abuse and exploit the young.\"\nMaxwell sought a retrial on the grounds that a juror did not disclose during jury selection that he had been sexually abused as a child. He had shared a narrative of that abuse with other jurors during the proceedings. On 1 April 2022, the judge found that the juror's failure to disclose his abuse as a child did not warrant a new trial and dismissed Maxwell's request to set aside the verdict.\nOn 28 June 2022, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison; prosecutors were seeking a sentence of at least 30 years. In her concluding verdict, the judge said: \"The evidence at trial established that Ms Maxwell directly and repeatedly and over the course of many years participated in a horrific scheme to entice, transport and traffic underage girls, some as young as 14, for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein. I will pause on those words for a moment, 'by and with Epstein.' It is important at the outset to emphasize that although Epstein was, of course, central to this criminal scheme, Ms Maxwell is not being punished in place of Epstein or as a proxy for Epstein. Like every other participant in a multi-defendant case, Ms Maxwell is being punished for the role that she played in the criminal conduct. As to that role, the trial evidence established that Ms. Maxwell was instrumental in the abuse of several underage girls and that she herself participated in some of the abuse.\"\nMaxwell had complained of threats coming from prison staff in the days prior to sentencing, but gave no details about the nature of the threats. Although she had been placed on suicide watch on 24 June, she told the psychiatric team that she was not suicidal. A related request by her lawyers for a sentencing delay was denied.\nMaxwell appealed the conviction on 7 July. On 25 July 2022, Maxwell was transferred from Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn to a low-security federal prison for female inmates at FCI Tallahassee. She is scheduled to be released on 17 July 2037. In August 2022, her former lawyers sued Maxwell, alleging that she failed to pay $878,000 in legal fees.\nOn 17 September 2024, three judges at the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Maxwell's five convictions and sentence. In response, her lawyer said she would appeal to the US Supreme Court. Its decision, in docket number 24-1073, which was renewed by her lawyer David Oscar Markus on 28 July the next business day after her prison interview with deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, is expected after 29 September 2025. The petition tests whether an agreement by one federal prosecutor (to wit, Acosta) binds his colleagues across the country.\n\n\n==== Incarceration and 2025 congressional testimony ====\nOn 23 July 2025 chairman James Comer of the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell to testify under oath about her involvement with Epstein. She answered on 29 July through her lawyer and demanded immunity from further prosecution. Interest in her case, says journalist Michael Wolff, had lately peaked with the 17 July publication in Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal of a 50th birthday letter of congratulations to Epstein from Donald Trump, who immediately filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the newspaper. The scrapbook had been compiled in 2003 by Maxwell.\nAfter US Attorney Todd Blanche, who in 2024 had defended Trump and in 2025 was appointed by Trump in his inaugural cleansing of the DOJ, interviewed Maxwell on 24 and 25 July 2025. During the interview Maxwell said that Donald Trump had not done anything in her presence that would have caused concern to the convicted sex offender.\nOn 1 August the Bureau of Prisons confirmed that Maxwell had been transferred from FCI Tallahassee to Federal Prison Camp, Bryan in Bryan, Texas, a minimum security facility, \"among the facilities with the lowest level of security in the federal system, with limited or no perimeter fencing, dormitory-style housing and a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio\", regarded as one of the best federal prisons to serve time in. The White House told reporters that she had received no \"preferential treatment\" and suggested that her move was routine.\nOn 5 August, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi proposed to the House Judiciary committee, House Resolution 119-635, which \"affirms that Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction and sentencing were more than warranted by the facts, and any receipt of a pardon, commutation, or other form of clemency by Ghislaine Maxwell would deny survivors the justice they deserve; and formally opposes the granting of a pardon, commutation, or other form of clemency to Ghislaine Maxwell.\"\n\n\n=== 2022 perjury trial ===\nIn December 2021 Maxwell faced a second criminal trial for perjury on two charges that she lied under oath during a civil suit in 2015 about Epstein's abuse of underage girls. Each count carried a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Prosecutors have said that perjury charges would be dropped if she were sentenced on schedule. Following a petition for a new trial, submitted under seal, prosecutors told the judge on 4 February 2022 that Maxwell's arguments for a retrial must be \"publicly docketed\"; the judge said that the reasons for making the submission under seal must be made public.\n\n\n=== 2025 release of transcripts ===\nOn 22 August 2025 the US Department of Justice released transcripts and recordings of interviews with Maxwell.\n\n\n== TerraMar Project ==\nIn 2012, Maxwell founded the TerraMar Project, a nonprofit organisation that advocated the protection of oceans. She gave a lecture for TerraMar at the University of Texas at Dallas and a TED talk, at TEDx Charlottesville in 2014. Maxwell accompanied Stuart Beck, a 2013 TerraMar board member, to two United Nations meetings to discuss the project.\nThe TerraMar Project announced its closure on 12 July 2019, less than a week after the charges of sex trafficking brought by New York federal prosecutors against Epstein became public. An associated, UK-based company, Terramar (UK), listed Maxwell as a director. An application for the United Kingdom organisation to be closed was made on 4 September 2019, with the first notice in The London Gazette made on 17 September 2019. The company Terramar (UK) was listed as officially dissolved on 3 December 2019.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSince at least 1997, Maxwell has maintained a residence in Belgravia, London. In 2000, Maxwell moved into a 7,000-square-foot (650 m2) townhouse on East 65th Street, New York City, six blocks from Epstein's mansion. Maxwell's townhouse was purchased for US$4.95 million by an anonymous limited liability company, with an address that matches the office of J. Epstein & Co. Representing the buyer was Darren Indyke, Epstein's longtime lawyer. In April 2016, the property was sold for US$15 million.\nFor a time during her London years, Maxwell dated Count Gianfranco Cicogna. Andrew Lownie maintains that Maxwell was romantically linked to Prince Andrew for a few years around year 2000. Following her personal and professional involvement with Epstein, Maxwell was romantically linked for several years to Ted Waitt, founder of Gateway Computers. She attended the wedding of Chelsea Clinton in 2010 as Waitt's guest. Maxwell helped Waitt obtain and renovate a luxury yacht, the Plan B, and used it for travel to France and Croatia before their relationship ended, in late 2010 or early 2011.\nOn 15 August 2019, reports surfaced that Maxwell had been living since 2007 in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, in the home of Scott G. Borgerson, a Council on Foreign Relations fellow in residence. In October 2020, due to the publicity surrounding Maxwell, Borgerson stepped down as CEO of CargoMetrics, a hedge fund he had founded. Maxwell and Borgerson were described as having been in a romantic relationship for several years. Locals in the town of Manchester-by-the-Sea said Maxwell had kept a low profile, went by \"G\" instead of her full first name, and had been seen on several occasions walking a Vizsla dog along the beach.\nBorgerson and Maxwell filed documents in Massachusetts Land Court about Borgerson's residence, known as Phippin House, during a civil dispute with neighbours regarding rescinded access rights to the larger Sharksmouth Estate in 2019. A neighbouring property manager attested that Maxwell and Borgerson were living together at the property in question. Others have said they had been seen repeatedly running together in the mornings.\nBorgerson stated in August 2019 that Maxwell was not currently living at the home and that he did not know where she was. On 15 August 2019, the New York Post published photographs of Maxwell dining at a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles, claiming that \"The Post found the socialite hiding in plain sight in the least likely place imaginable—a fast-food joint in Los Angeles\". The photos were later proven to have been taken at a meeting with Maxwell's friend and attorney Leah Saffian, who also gave other pictures to the Daily Mail.\nMaxwell moved to a remote 156-acre (63 ha) property in Bradford, New Hampshire, in late 2019, where she used former British military personnel as personal security until her arrest in July 2020. At the time of her arraignment, federal prosecutors stated that Maxwell was married; she did not disclose the identity of her spouse, or their respective finances. In December 2020, it emerged that she had married Borgerson in 2016.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJean-Luc Brunel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nLucia Osborne-Crowley (2024): The Lasting Harm – Witnessing The Trial of Ghislaine Maxwell\nJohn Sweeney (2021): Hunting Ghislaine\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBureau of Prisons Inmate Locator — GHISLAINE NOELLE MAXWELL Register Number: 02879-509\nRight Hand Woman 27:21 video, 60 Minutes, Australia, 2020\nExposing Jeffrey Epstein's international sex trafficking ring, 45:16 video, 60 Minutes, Australia, 2019\nUnsealed Court Documents from Giuffre vs. Maxwell released 2019 (74 pages)\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from Brown v.

        "title": "Ed Gein",
        "content": "Edward Theodore Gein ( GEEN; August 27, 1906 – July 26, 1984), also known as \"the Butcher of Plainfield\" or \"the Plainfield Ghoul\", was an American murderer, suspected serial killer and body snatcher. Gein's crimes, committed around his hometown of Plainfield, Wisconsin, gathered widespread notoriety in 1957 after authorities discovered that he had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned keepsakes from their bones and skin. He also confessed to killing two women: tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954, and hardware store owner Bernice Worden in 1957.\nGein was initially found unfit to stand trial and confined to a mental health facility. By 1968 he was judged competent to stand trial; he was found guilty of the murder of Worden, but was found legally insane and thus was remanded to a psychiatric institution. Gein died at Mendota Mental Health Institute from respiratory failure resulting from lung cancer on July 26, 1984, aged 77. He is buried next to his family in the Plainfield Cemetery, in a now-unmarked grave.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood ===\nEdward Theodore Gein was born in La Crosse, Wisconsin, on August 27, 1906, the second of two sons to George Philip Gein (1873–1940) and Augusta Wilhelmine Gein (née Lehrke; 1878–1945). Gein had an older brother named Henry. Augusta, who was fervently religious and nominally Lutheran, frequently preached to her sons about the innate immorality of the world, the evil of drinking and her belief that all women were naturally promiscuous and instruments of the devil. She reserved time every afternoon to read to them from the Bible, usually selecting verses from the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation concerning death, murder and divine retribution. Gein idolized and became obsessed with his mother.\nGeorge Gein worked as a carpenter, tanner and in the city fire department. He also owned a local grocery shop but soon sold the business and left the city with his family to live on a 155-acre (63-hectare) farm in the town of Plainfield, Wisconsin, which became their permanent residence. Augusta took advantage of the farm's isolation by turning away outsiders who could have influenced her sons. \n\nGein left the farm only to attend school. Outside of school, he spent most of his time doing chores on the farm. Gein was shy; classmates and teachers remembered him as having strange mannerisms, such as seemingly random laughter, as if he were laughing at his own personal jokes. Augusta punished Gein whenever he tried to make friends, according to family acquaintances. Despite his poor social development, Gein did fairly well in school, particularly in reading.\n\n\n=== Deaths in immediate family ===\nOn April 1, 1940, Gein's father died of heart failure at age 66. Gein and his brother Henry began doing odd jobs around town to help cover living expenses. The brothers were generally considered reliable and honest by the rest of the community. While both worked as handymen, Gein also frequently babysat for neighbors. He enjoyed babysitting, seeming to relate more easily to children than adults. Henry began dating a divorced mother of two and planned to move in with her. He worried about his brother's attachment to their mother and often spoke ill of her around Gein, who responded with shock and hurt.\nOn May 16, 1944, Gein was burning away marsh vegetation on the property; the fire got out of control, drawing the attention of the local fire department. By the end of the day—the fire having been extinguished and the firefighters gone—Gein reported Henry missing. With lanterns and flashlights, a search party searched for 43-year-old Henry, whose dead body was found lying face down. Apparently, Henry had been dead for some time, and it appeared that the cause of death was heart failure since he had not been burned or injured otherwise. \nIt was later reported by biographer Harold Schechter that Henry had bruises on his head. Police dismissed the possibility of foul play and the county coroner later officially listed asphyxiation as the cause of death. The authorities accepted the accident theory, but no official investigation was conducted and an autopsy was not performed. Questioning Gein about the death of Bernice Worden in 1957, state investigator Joe Wilimovsky brought up questions about Henry's death. George Arndt, who studied the case, wrote that, in retrospect, it was \"possible and likely\" that Henry's death was \"the 'Cain and Abel' aspect of this case.\"\nWith Henry deceased, Ed and Augusta were now alone. Augusta had a paralyzing stroke shortly after Henry's death, and Ed devoted himself to taking care of her. Sometime in 1945, he later recounted, he and his mother visited a man named Smith, who lived nearby, to purchase straw. According to Ed, Augusta witnessed Smith beating a dog. A woman inside the Smith residence came outside and yelled for him to stop, but Smith beat the dog to death. Augusta was extremely upset by this scene; however, what bothered her did not appear to be the brutality toward the dog but, rather, the presence of the woman. Augusta told Ed that the woman was not married to Smith and so had no business being there, and angrily called her \"Smith's harlot\". She had a second stroke soon after, and her health deteriorated rapidly. Augusta died on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67. Ed was devastated by her death; in the words of Schechter, he had \"lost his only friend and one true love. And he was absolutely alone in the world.\"\n\n\n== Work ==\nGein held on to the farm and earned money from odd jobs. He boarded up rooms used by his mother, including the upstairs, downstairs parlor and living room, leaving them untouched. While the rest of the house became increasingly squalid, these rooms remained pristine. Gein lived thereafter in a small room next to the kitchen. Around this time, he became interested in reading pulp magazines and adventure stories, particularly those involving cannibals or Nazi atrocities, specifically concerning Ilse Koch, who had been accused of selecting tattooed prisoners for death in order to fashion lampshades and other items from their skins. Gein received a farm subsidy from the federal government starting in 1951. He occasionally worked for the local municipal road crew and crop-threshing crews in the Plainfield area. Sometime between 1946 and 1956, he also sold an 80-acre (32 ha) parcel of land that Henry had owned.\n\n\n== Crimes ==\n\n\n=== Confirmed ===\nOn the morning of November 16, 1957, 58-year-old Plainfield hardware store owner Bernice Worden disappeared. The hardware store's truck was seen driving out from the rear of the building at around 9:30 a.m. The hardware store saw few customers the entire day; some area residents believed that this was because of deer hunting season. Worden's son, Deputy Sheriff Frank Worden, entered the store around 5:00 p.m. to find the cash register open and blood stains on the floor.\nFrank Worden told investigators that on the evening before his mother's disappearance, Gein had been in the store and was expected to return the next morning for a gallon of antifreeze. A sales slip for the antifreeze was the last receipt written by Worden on the morning that she disappeared. That evening, Gein was arrested at a West Plainfield grocery store, and the Waushara County Sheriff's Department searched the Gein farm.\nA sheriff's deputy discovered Worden's decapitated body in a shed on Gein's property, hung upside down by her legs with a crossbar at her ankles and ropes at her wrists. The torso was \"dressed out like a deer\". She had been shot with a .22-caliber rifle, and the mutilations were made after her death. Searching the house, authorities found:\n\nWhole human bones and fragments\nA wastebasket made of human skin\nHuman skin covering several chairs\nSkulls on his bedposts\nFemale skulls, some with the tops sawn off\nBowls made from human skulls\nA corset made from a female torso skinned from shoulders to waist\nLeggings made from human leg skin\nMasks made from the skin of female heads\nMary Hogan's face mask in a paper bag\nMary Hogan's skull in a box\nBernice Worden's entire head in a burlap sack\nBernice Worden's heart \"in a plastic bag in front of Gein's potbelly stove\"\nNine vulvas in a shoe box\nA young girl's dress and \"the vulvas of two females judged to have been about fifteen years old\"\nA belt made from female human nipples\nFour noses\nA pair of lips on a window shade drawstring\nA lampshade made from the skin of a human face\nFingernails from female fingers\nThese artifacts were photographed at the state crime laboratory and then \"decently disposed of\". When questioned, Gein told investigators that between 1947 and 1952, he had made as many as forty nocturnal visits to three local graveyards to exhume recently buried bodies while he was in a \"daze-like\" state. On about thirty of those visits, he said that he came out of the daze while in the cemetery, left the grave in good order and returned home emptyhanded. On the other occasions, he dug up the graves of recently buried middle-aged women he thought resembled his mother and took the bodies home, where he tanned their skins to make his paraphernalia.\nGein admitted to stealing from nine graves and led investigators to their locations. Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by Gein. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops of the boxes were about two feet (61 centimeters) below the surface in sandy soil. Gein had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. The test graves were exhumed because authorities were uncertain as to whether the slight Gein was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening. They were found as Gein described: one casket was empty; another casket was empty but contained a few bones and Gein's crowbar; and the final casket saw most of the body missing, yet Gein had returned rings and some body parts. Thus, Gein's confession was largely corroborated.\nSoon after his mother's death, Gein began to create a \"woman suit\" so that \"he could become his mother—to literally crawl into her skin.\" He denied having sex with the bodies he exhumed, explaining: \"They smelled too bad.\" During state crime laboratory interrogation, Gein also admitted to shooting 51-year-old Mary Hogan, a tavern owner missing since December 8, 1954, whose head was found in his house, but he later denied memory of details of her death.\nA 16-year-old youth, whose parents were friends of Gein and who attended baseball games and movies with him, reported that Gein kept shrunken heads in his house, which he had described as relics sent by a cousin who had served in the Philippines during World War II. Upon investigation by the police, these were determined to be human facial skins, carefully peeled from corpses and used by Gein as masks.\nDuring questioning, Sheriff Art Schley reportedly assaulted Gein by banging his head and face into a brick wall. As a result, Gein's initial confession was ruled inadmissible. Schley died of heart failure in 1968 at age 43, before Gein's trial. Many who knew Schley said he was traumatized by the horror of Gein's crimes and this, along with the fear of having to testify (especially about assaulting Gein), caused his death.\n\n\n=== Suspected ===\nIn addition to the murders of Hogan and Worden, Gein was also considered regarding several other unsolved cases in Wisconsin. In November 1957, authorities confronted Gein with a list of missing persons cases that had occurred between the death of his mother and Worden. Their suspicions were further aroused after the discovery of Hogan's remains. However, lie detector tests exonerated Gein of any other murders, and his psychiatrists concluded that his violence was only directed to women who physically resembled his mother.\n\nGeorgia Jean Weckler, 8, disappeared near her farm home in Fort Atkinson at approximately 3:30 p.m. on May 1, 1947. She was given a lift home from grade school in Jefferson by a neighbor who dropped Weckler off at the lane that led from U.S. Highway 12 to the Weckler farm. Weckler was last seen pausing to open the family mailbox and removing a stack of mail. Witnesses reported seeing a dark-colored, possibly black, 1936 Ford sedan with a gray plastic spotlight in the vicinity that afternoon; Gein owned a black 1937 Ford.\nEvelyn Grace Hartley, 14, went missing while babysitting a 20-month-old girl at the home of La Crosse State College professor Viggo Rasmussen on the evening of October 24, 1953, in La Crosse. That evening, her father Richard called the Rasmussen house several times after she failed to check in as planned at 8:30 p.m.; he received no answer. Concerned, he drove to the Rasmussen house to find the doors were locked, the lights and radio on and items scattered all over the house. The living room furniture had been moved around to different places, as were Evelyn's school books. Richard found her shoes in different rooms, one shoe upstairs and one downstairs. He also found his daughter's broken glasses upstairs. Richard did not find Evelyn in the house. After his arrest, Gein was questioned regarding Evelyn's disappearance, however, he denied involvement in the disappearance and passed two lie detector tests; police found no trace of Evelyn's remains during a search of Gein's property.\nVictor Harold Travis, 42, a resident of Adams County, went off to hunt deer in the company of acquaintance Raymond Burgess on November 1, 1952. In the late afternoon, the pair stopped for refreshments at Mac's Bar in Plainfield for several hours. At around 7 p.m., they both left the bar, got into Burgess’ car and drove away. The hunters, along with the car Burgess was driving, were never seen again and no trace of them was ever found. Travis and Burgess had been hunting on the farm next to Gein's farm, despite his objections to them hunting on the day of their disappearance.\nIn addition, Gein has also been tentatively linked to the June 1954 disappearance of neighbor James Walsh, 32; Walsh and his wife lived near Gein, who performed chores for her after her husband went missing.\nGein was also investigated for potential involvement in the August 1956 disappearance of Irene Keating, 30, who was last seen in Plainfield,\nand in the attempted abduction of Judy Rodencal, 16, from Auroraville.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Trial ===\nOn November 21, 1957, Gein was arraigned on one count of first degree murder in Waushara County Court, where he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and found mentally incompetent, thus unfit for trial. He was sent to the Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane (now the Dodge Correctional Institution), a maximum-security facility in Waupun, and later transferred to the Mendota State Hospital in Madison.\nIn 1968, doctors determined Gein was \"mentally able to confer with counsel and participate in his defense\". The trial began on November 7, 1968, and lasted one week. A psychiatrist testified that Gein had told him that he did not know whether the killing of Worden was intentional or accidental. Gein had told him that while he examined a gun in Worden's store, the weapon discharged and killed Worden. He said he had not aimed the rifle at Worden, and did not remember anything else that happened that morning.\nAt the request of the defense, Gein's trial was held without a jury, with Judge Robert H. Gollmar presiding. Gein was found guilty by Gollmar on November 14. A second trial dealt with Gein's sanity; after testimony by doctors for the prosecution and defense, Gollmar ruled Gein \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" and ordered him committed to Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Gein spent the rest of his life in a mental hospital. Judge Gollmar wrote, \"Due to prohibitive costs, Gein was tried for only one murder—that of Mrs. Worden. He also admitted to killing Mary Hogan.\"\n\n\n=== Fate of Gein's property ===\nGein's house, the outbuildings and his 195-acre (79 ha) property were appraised at $4,700 (equivalent to $51,000 in 2024). His possessions were scheduled to be auctioned on March 30, 1958, amidst rumors that the house and the land it stood on might become a tourist attraction. Early on the morning of March 20, the house was destroyed by fire. A deputy fire marshal reported that a garbage fire had been set 75 feet (23 m) from the house by a cleaning crew who was given the task of disposing refuse; that hot coals were recovered from the spot of the bonfire, but that the fire did not spread along the ground from that location to the house.\nArson was suspected, but the cause of the fire was never officially determined. It is possible that the fire was not considered a matter of urgency to Fire Chief Frank Worden, son of Gein's victim, Bernice Worden. When Gein learned of the incident while in detention, he shrugged and said, \"Just as well.\" Gein's Ford sedan, which he used to haul the bodies of his victims, was sold at public auction for $760 (equivalent to $8,300 in 2024) to carnival sideshow operator, Bunny Gibbons. Gibbons charged carnival-goers 25¢ admission to see it.\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\nGein died at the Mendota Mental Health Institute due to respiratory failure, secondary to lung cancer, on July 26, 1984, at the age of 77. Over the years, souvenir seekers chipped away pieces from his gravestone, until the stone itself was stolen in 2000. It was recovered in June 2001, near Seattle, Washington, and was placed in storage at the Waushara County Sheriff's Department. Gein is interred between his parents and brother in Plainfield Cemetery; his gravesite now unmarked, but not unknown.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nGein's story has had a lasting effect on American popular culture as evidenced by its numerous appearances in film, music and literature. The tale first came to widespread public attention in the fictionalized version presented by Robert Bloch in his 1959 suspense novel, Psycho. In addition to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film of Bloch's novel, Psycho, Gein's story was loosely adapted into numerous films, including Deranged (1974), In the Light of the Moon (2000) (released in the United States and Australia as Ed Gein (2001)), Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield (2007), Ed Gein, the Musical (2010), and the Rob Zombie film, House of 1000 Corpses, and its sequel, The Devil's Rejects. Gein served as the inspiration for myriad fictional serial killers, most notably Norman Bates (Psycho), Leatherface (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre), Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs), Garland Greene (Con Air), and the character of Dr. Oliver Thredson in the TV series American Horror Story: Asylum.\nAmerican filmmaker Errol Morris and German filmmaker Werner Herzog attempted unsuccessfully to collaborate on a film project about Gein from 1975 to 1976. Morris claimed to have interviewed Gein several times and ended up spending almost a year in Plainfield interviewing dozens of locals. The pair planned secretly to exhume Gein's mother from her grave to test a theory, but never followed through on the scheme, and eventually ended their collaboration. The aborted project was described in a 1989 New Yorker profile of Morris.\nGein's story inspired American grunge band Tad to write the song \"Nipple Belt\" for their 1989 album, God's Balls. Gein also inspired American thrash metal band Slayer to write the song \"Dead Skin Mask\" for their 1990 album, Seasons in the Abyss. Also, Blind Melon singer Shannon Hoon stated in interviews that the song \"Skinned\" off their 1995 album, Soup, was directly about Gein, and explained many of the crimes he committed. Additionally, Gein was the inspiration and namesake for the song \"Nothing to Gein,\" by American heavy metal band Mudvayne; released in 2000 on their album, L.D. 50.\nThe character Patrick Bateman, in the 1991 novel American Psycho and its 2000 film adaptation, mistakenly attributes a quote by Edmund Kemper to Gein saying, \"You know what Ed Gein said about women? ... He said, 'When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right ... [the other part wonders] what her head would look like on a stick'.\"\nIn 2012, German director Jörg Buttgereit wrote and directed a stage play about Gein's case titled Kannibale und Liebe, at Theater Dortmund in Germany. The part of Gein was played by actor Uwe Rohbeck. According to George W. Arndt, news reports at the time of Gein's crimes spawned a subgenre of black humor called \"Geiners.\"\nIn 2022, Gein, portrayed by Shane Kerwin, appears in the first season of Netflix's anthology series Monster as a possible inspiration for serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes. However, a direct connection between the two is seen as speculation. In 2024, it was announced that Charlie Hunnam will portray Gein in The Ed Gein Story, the third season of Monster, where Gein will be the primary focus of the season. In 2023, a multi-part docuseries aired about Gein's life and upbringing titled Psycho: The Lost Tapes of Ed Gein. \n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGrave robbery\nBody snatching\nAnatoly Moskvin\nCarl Tanzler\nGeneral:\n\nList of homicides in Wisconsin\nList of serial killers in the United States\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nEd Gein at IMDb\nSchechter, Harold (November 21, 1957). \"Obsessive Love for His Mother Drove Gein to Slay, Rob Graves\".

        "title": "Malin Akerman",
        "content": "Malin Maria Åkerman (born 12 May 1978), often anglicised to Malin Akerman, is a Swedish actress. She first appeared in smaller parts in both Canadian and American productions, including The Utopian Society (2003) and Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (2004). Following a main role on the HBO mockumentary series The Comeback (2005), Akerman co-starred in the commercially successful romantic comedies The Heartbreak Kid (2007) and 27 Dresses (2008). She gained wider recognition for her role as Silk Spectre II in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, for which she received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\nShe had supporting and starring roles in the box office hits The Proposal (2009), Couples Retreat (2009), and Rampage (2018). Her performance in the comedy horror film The Final Girls (2015) garnered a Fangoria Chainsaw Award nomination. Akerman's other works include the critically acclaimed dramas I'll See You in My Dreams (2015) and To the Stars (2019). On television, she earned critical praise for her lead role on the ABC sitcom Trophy Wife (2013–2014). She was part of the main cast on the Adult Swim comedy series Childrens Hospital from 2010 to 2016, and the Showtime drama series Billions from 2016 to 2019.\nApart from acting and modelling, Akerman had a brief music career in the early 2000s as the lead vocalist for alternative rock band the Petalstones, which released its debut studio album in 2005. She subsequently left the project to focus on her acting career. She has been married twice, first from 2007 to 2014 to Petalstones drummer Roberto Zincone, with whom she has a son, and, since 2018, to English actor Jack Donnelly. Akerman hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Malmö alongside Petra Mede.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAkerman was born in Stockholm on 12 May 1978, the daughter of aerobics teacher and part-time model Pia (née Sundström) and insurance broker Magnus Åkerman. When she was two, the family moved to Canada when her father was offered a job there. Four years later her parents divorced and her father moved back to Sweden. Both parents remarried, giving Akerman one half-brother and two half-sisters, including Jennifer Åkerman. After her mother remarried, they moved to Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. Her mother divorced again in Akerman's teenage years. She attended many different schools, including Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario. She visited her father in Falsterbo during school breaks and talked to him regularly on the phone. She cites her parents as \"supportive, positive influences\" in her life. She was raised as a Buddhist.\nIn her youth Akerman competed professionally in figure skating for ten years. Her mother introduced her to modelling while she was still in primary school. At age 16, she was discovered by Ford Models at the Pen Centre shopping mall in St. Catharines. She was signed to the agency and later won a contract with skincare company Noxzema. She soon moved to Toronto while attending North Toronto Collegiate Institute and later Dante Alighieri Academy. At the age of 18, inspired by the \"helplessness\" she sometimes felt during her childhood, she decided to become a child psychologist. She supported her education by modelling for television commercials and catalogue layouts. While studying for a year at York University in Toronto, she was simultaneously offered guest roles on television as a result of her exposure in commercials. She saw the acting roles as further opportunities to pay for her education but found herself enjoying acting, and later dropped out of school to become an actress. She moved to Los Angeles in 2001 to pursue acting full-time.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early roles (1997–2008) ===\nAkerman made her acting debut on the Canadian science fiction series Earth: Final Conflict in 1997 in a smaller role as a robot. She originally landed a role on an MTV pilot with Rachel McAdams but the project was never picked up by the network. In 2000 she guest starred on Relic Hunter and had a smaller role in the American film The Skulls. The following year she made appearances on the series Doc, Twice in a Lifetime and Witchblade. In 2001 she moved to Los Angeles, California, in hopes of pursuing a broader acting career. At first, she worked as a waitress and stayed at a friend's house. In 2002 she received a role in the film The Utopian Society. The film was edited by Francesco Sondelli, guitarist for alternative rock band Ozono. Sondelli asked Akerman to help the band with song lyrics and later asked her to sing. Akerman subsequently became the band's singer, and they changed their name to the Petalstones. The band's debut album Stung was released in August 2005, but she eventually left to focus on her acting career. She described her singing as \"sort of a self-made, self-taught, if-you-can't-hit-the-note-scream-it kind of thing\".\n\nIn 2004, she got a small role in the film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, but considered moving back to Canada as most of her auditions failed. She was then cast in a main role as Juna on the HBO television series The Comeback (2005), with Lisa Kudrow in the lead role. Kudrow played a former sitcom star who tried to restart her career. Akerman's appearance on the show garnered media attention and resulted in her being offered more roles. A year later, she guest starred on an episode of Love Monkey and two episodes of Entourage. Before the Entourage episodes aired, she landed a role in the 2007 comedy film The Brothers Solomon. The film was a box office bomb and received largely critical reviews. The same year, she also appeared in the films The Invasion, for which she was uncredited, and Heavy Petting.\nAkerman signed up for a role alongside Ben Stiller in the comedy film The Heartbreak Kid, directed by the Farrelly Brothers, in 2006. She played Lila, the newly wedded wife of Stiller's character. The film follows the couple's honeymoon in Mexico, where Stiller's character falls in love with another woman and realizes that the marriage was a mistake. A remake of the 1972 film of the same title, it was released in October 2007 to generally poor reviews, as critics deemed it \"neither as daring nor as funny\" as the directors' earlier films. Akerman's performance garnered more positive reviews; Desson Thomson of The Washington Post called her a \"fabulous comic partner\" to Stiller, while Roger Moore of Times Herald-Record asserted that she had outperformed him. The film grossed US$14 million in its opening weekend in the United States, and went on to gross US$127 million globally.\nIn 2007, Akerman joined the cast of 27 Dresses, a romantic comedy film directed by Anne Fletcher with Katherine Heigl in the lead role. The film follows Heigl's character Jane, who has always been the bridesmaid and dreams of her own wedding. Akerman played Jane's sister Tess. The film was shot during the summer of 2007, and was released in January 2008 to weak critical reception as it was considered \"clichéd and mostly forgettable\". The film was more successful commercially, with a gross of US$160 million. Akerman played the title role in Bye Bye Sally, a short film directed by Paul Leyden and based on Lisa Mannetti's short story Everybody Wins. The film premiered at the 2009 Newport Beach Film Festival.\n\n\n=== Breakthrough with Watchmen (2009–2011) ===\n\nIn 2009, Akerman starred as Silk Spectre II in the superhero film Watchmen, an adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel of the same name. Directed by Zack Snyder, the feature film is set in an alternate reality in 1985 where a group of retired vigilantes investigate an apparent conspiracy against them. Snyder favoured Akerman over other more well-known actresses as he felt that they could not play such a serious part. Akerman rehearsed with \"months of hardcore training\" and went on a very strict diet. She wore a brunette wig, high heels and an uncomfortable latex costume, which provided little protection when performing stunts, and she often bruised herself during filming. Akerman stated that her character carries the emotion of the film as she is the only woman among several men. Premiering in February 2009, the film received generally favourable reviews, and was a commercial success, grossing US$185 million worldwide. Although Akerman was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film, critics were generally negative towards her acting. She also received nominations for a Teen Choice Award and two Scream Awards. In retrospect, she has stated that she struggled with her confidence while shooting the film and \"felt way out of [her] league\". Watchmen was the largest headlining project of her career at the time which she did not feel prepared for. She said, \"I had no training and I was working with these fabulous theater actors who had all the training in the world. I definitely didn't feel worthy of being there.\"\nAkerman appeared in the 2009 romantic comedy film The Proposal, starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds in the lead roles. Akerman played a supporting role as Gertrude, the ex-girlfriend of Reynolds' character. Although the film received mixed reviews, it went on to gross US$317 million worldwide. Also in 2009, Akerman starred in the comedy film Couples Retreat, opposite Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn. The film follows four couples as they travel to a tropical island resort for couples therapy. Akerman played Ronnie, the wife of Vaughn's character. She enjoyed playing a mother for the first time and tried to make her character as truthful as possible. The film premiered in theatres in October 2009 and grossed US$34 million in its opening weekend in the United States, entering number one at the box office, and totalled US$171 million worldwide. Reception for the film was mainly negative, although Akerman's performance was met with more positive reactions.\nIn 2010, Akerman co-starred as Annie in the Josh Radnor-directed comedy-drama film Happythankyoumoreplease As her character has alopecia, Akerman shaved off her eyebrows and wore a bald cap to cover her hair. She was originally offered a different part, but felt that she wanted to play Annie as it was different from her previous roles. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2010 and received an audience award for Favorite U.S. Drama. Reviews from critics were polarized, but Akerman received praise. Later in 2010, she guest starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"The Wedding Bride\", and joined the cast of the Adult Swim comedy series Childrens Hospital. Playing the part of the promiscuous Dr. Valerie Flame, Akerman joined during the series' second season along with Henry Winkler. The series was originally a web series and Akerman accepted the role after viewing several webisodes. \"It was totally up my alley, my kind of humor\", she said of the series. The same year, she played a supporting role in the romantic comedy film The Romantics with Katie Holmes, Josh Duhamel and Anna Paquin. The film premiered in September 2010 on limited release to generally negative reviews.\n\nIn 2010, she starred in Sebastian Gutierrez's comedy film Elektra Luxx opposite Carla Gugino and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The film is a sequel to 2009's Women in Trouble. Akerman played Trixie, an awkward drug store clerk who falls for Gordon-Levitt's character, who in turn is obsessed with Gugino's character, a retired porn star. Akerman was offered the role during a screening of Women in Trouble. The film premiered in March 2011 on limited release and received generally unfavourable reviews; critics dismissed it as a \"bizarre sex comedy\". Next, Akerman starred in the lead female role in the film The Bang Bang Club, which follows a group of young photojournalists in South Africa during the final stages of the apartheid. She played Robin Comley, a newspaper photo editor. The film premiered during the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival to mixed reviews from the press. In 2010, Akerman signed up for a part in newcomer Aaron Harvey's Catch .44, a drama-thriller film with Forest Whitaker and Bruce Willis in the male lead roles. The film was generally ignored by critics and movie goers alike.\n\n\n=== Further film and television work (2012–2014) ===\nAkerman had a supporting role in the 2012 comedy film Wanderlust, with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. The film focuses on an overworked couple who end up at a commune when they try to slow things down. Akerman played Eva, a woman at the commune. The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who were divided regarding its humour, but ultimately praised the cast. Wanderlust underperformed at the box office, earning just over US$20 million worldwide during its theatrical run. Akerman appeared in the comedy film The Giant Mechanical Man, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2012 to average reviews. She had a supporting role in the 2012 rock musical film Rock of Ages, based on the stage production of the same name. She played Constance Sack, a journalist who interviews Tom Cruise's character Stacee Jaxx. She hired a vocal coach as her role required her to sing; she and Cruise recorded a duet of Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" (1984). The duet appears on the soundtrack, which peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and sold 320,000 copies in the US. Although the film grossed lower than expected, its opening weekend gross in the United States became the third-highest ever for an adaption of a stage production.\n\nAkerman played opposite Nicolas Cage in the 2012 bank heist action film Stolen. The film received negative reviews from critics and bombed at the box office. Next, Akerman appeared in the crime film Hotel Noir (2012), the comedy horror film Cottage Country (2013), and the action thriller The Numbers Station (2013), all of which were panned by critics. In 2013, Akerman portrayed Debbie Harry in Randall Miller's film CBGB. The film received a limited theatrical release and was met with negative reviews in the press. During this time, she had several guest roles on television, including the series Newsreaders, Robot Chicken, and Welcome to Sweden. From 2012 to 2013, she had a recurring role on ABC's comedy series Suburgatory as Alex, the absent mother of the main character Tessa. Akerman was also a contestant on the comedy series Burning Love (2012), which parodied the reality series The Bachelor.\nFrom 2013 to 2014, Akerman held the lead role on the ABC sitcom Trophy Wife. She played Kate Harrison, the third wife of Bradley Whitford's character. Marcia Gay Harden and Michaela Watkins co-starred as Whitford's two ex-wives. Akerman also served as a producer. She was initially put off by the title, \"I saw the title and I said, 'Hell no, I'm not playing a trophy wife!'\" However, she changed her mind after reading the script; she liked the writing and how the character is not actually a trophy wife. Executive producer Lee Eisenberg said the title was \"always meant to be ironic\". The series received positive reviews from critics, who praised the chemistry between the actors. Akerman received critical acclaim for her performance; Gabriel Mizrahi of The Huffington Post deemed her portrayal \"terrific\", and Matt Webb Mitovich of TVLine opined that she \"no less than shines here, coming off as fun-loving but not flaky, warm and not overheated\". Several television critics named it one of the best new sitcoms of 2013, and some criticized its title for confusing audiences by suggesting it is about something that it is not. Willa Paskin of Slate regarded the title \"terrible\" and \"an insult to its lovely, daffy main character\". Criticism was also directed towards ABC for giving the series a poor time slot. Trophy Wife aired for one season before its cancellation.\n\n\n=== Recent work (2015–present) ===\nAkerman was a main cast member on Yahoo! Screen's short-lived comedy series Sin City Saints (2015), which ran for an eight-episode season. She portrayed Dusty Halford, the lawyer of the eponymous basketball team. Akerman co-starred in Brett Haley's comedy-drama film I'll See You in My Dreams (2015) with Blythe Danner. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival to positive reviews. Also in 2015, she starred in the comedy slasher film The Final Girls with Taissa Farmiga. The film follows a group of high school students who are transported into a slasher film. The film received generally favourable reviews from critics, who noted its \"surprising layer of genuine emotion\" amidst \"the meta amusement\". Akerman was nominated for a Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.\n\nAkerman acted in two feature films in 2016, Misconduct and The Ticket, both of which received limited release. Critical reception of Misconduct was generally negative, while The Ticket attracted mixed reviews. Akerman's performance in the latter, as the wife of a blind man who regained his sight, was met with positive reception. The same year, Akerman starred alongside Orlando Bloom and Kate Micucci on an episode of the Netflix comedy-drama series Easy, an anthology series with stand-alone episodes of different characters exploring relationships. From 2016 to 2019, Akerman was a main cast member on the Showtime drama series Billions, playing the role of Lara Axelrod, the wife of billionaire hedge fund manager Bobby Axelrod, portrayed by Damian Lewis. Akerman enjoyed playing the character due to her \"no-nonsense\" attitude. The series received critical acclaim. She stepped into a recurring role for the third season to accommodate for roles in other projects, which was written into the storyline with her character becoming Bobby's ex-wife.\nAkerman was cast in Brad Peyton's science fiction monster film Rampage (2018), based on the video game series of the same name, as Claire Wyden, the CEO of a company responsible for the infection and mutation of several animals. She liked playing a villain for the first time as it was a \"good challenge\". She said, \"I don't think she had any redeeming qualities, but I don't think characters have to have redeeming qualities. It's quite fun to just enjoy being evil\". The film became a commercial success with a worldwide revenue of US$428 million, ending up as the twenty-first highest-grossing film of 2018. Critical reception was mixed, with some critics deeming it a \"brainless blockbuster\". In 2019, Akerman made a guest appearance on the Comedy Central educational comedy series Drunk History where she played accused murderer Beulah Annan. Akerman played the role of Grace Richmond, the mother of Liana Liberato's character, in Martha Stephens' coming-of-age drama To the Stars (2019). The film premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival to positive reviews from critics.\nAkerman signed on for an NBC drama pilot titled Prism in February 2019. The pilot, directed by Daniel Barnz, details a murder trial told through different perspectives of each key person involved, with Akerman as public defender Rachel Lewis. NBC passed on the project in May 2019. Akerman played her first Swedish-speaking film role in the jukebox musical film A Piece of My Heart, directed by Edward af Sillén and based on music by Swedish singer Tomas Ledin. The film received a Christmas 2019 release in Sweden. She also starred in The Sleepover, directed by Trish Sie for Netflix.

Akerman will next star in The Hunting Wives for Netflix, based upon the novel of the same name by May Cobb.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nHaving been born in Sweden and raised in Canada, Akerman has said that she has \"conflicting feelings\" for the two countries. In an interview for Toronto Star, she said, \"Every time I'm in Canada I feel more Swedish, and every time I'm in Sweden I feel more Canadian. I belong in both places and I love them both equally.\" She is a Swedish citizen but not a Canadian one, instead having permanent residency in Canada. She became an American citizen in October 2018. Apart from speaking fluent English and Swedish, she also speaks French, Italian and Spanish.\nAkerman met Italian musician Roberto Zincone in 2003, when she was the lead singer for the Petalstones, for which he was the drummer. They usually socialized after band practice, using a dictionary as Zincone could not speak English. They eventually started dating and married in Sorrento in June 2007. In 2013 they had a son. The couple separated in November 2013, and Zincone filed for divorce later that month. In October 2017, Akerman announced her engagement to English actor Jack Donnelly. They married in Tulum in December 2018.\nInspired by her Buddhist upbringing, Akerman has a lotus flower tattoo on her upper back. She also has a tattooed \"Z\" on her right wrist, which she got to honor Zincone when they were married.\nIn 2010, Akerman revealed that she is dyslexic and that it takes her \"a long time\" to learn her lines: \"I get horrified when I have to do table reads with the whole cast, because there's a lot of stuttering coming from me, so I have to do a lot of prep.\" Because of this, she prefers to improvise her lines.\n\n\n== Public image ==\n\nIn 2008 Akerman made her first appearance on AskMen.com's \"99 Most Desirable Women\" list at number 60. The same year men's magazine Maxim placed her at number 59 in their annual \"Hot 100\" rankings. The following year the magazine ranked her at number four.\nIn 2012 Akerman travelled to Tanzania with Opportunity International and has since begun support of their international development work, becoming a Young Ambassador for Opportunity in June 2012, and hosting a fundraiser for Opportunity in October 2012. She served food with fellow actress January Jones at the Los Angeles Mission's annual Thanksgiving event in 2021.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMalin Akerman at IMDb",

These films include Billy Madison (1995), Happy Gilmore (1996), The Waterboy (1998), The Wedding Singer (1998), Big Daddy (1999), Mr. Deeds (2002), Anger Management (2003), 50 First Dates (2004), The Longest Yard (2005), Click (2006), Grown Ups (2010), Just Go with It (2011), Jack and Jill (2011), Grown Ups 2 (2013) and Blended (2014).\nSandler had an estimated net worth of $420 million in 2020, and in 2021, he signed a new four-movie deal with Netflix worth over $250 million. He starred in the Netflix films The Ridiculous 6 (2015), The Do-Over (2016), Sandy Wexler (2017), The Week Of (2018), Murder Mystery (2019), Hubie Halloween (2020), Murder Mystery 2 (2023), and Happy Gilmore 2 (2025).

He has three older siblings, Scott, Elizabeth, and Valerie. His family is Jewish and descends from Russian Jewish immigrants on both sides. Sandler grew up in Manchester, New Hampshire, after his family moved there when he was six years old. He attended Manchester Central High School. As a teen, Sandler was in BBYO, a Jewish youth group. He graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in acting.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1987–1994: Early television and film roles ===\nIn 1987, Sandler played Theo Huxtable's friend Smitty on The Cosby Show and the Stud Boy or Trivia Delinquent on the MTV game show Remote Control. After his film debut in Going Overboard in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian Dennis Miller, who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels. Sandler was hired as a writer for SNL in 1990, and became a featured player the following year. He made a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including \"The Thanksgiving Song\" and \"The Chanukah Song\". Sandler told Conan O'Brien on The Tonight Show that NBC fired him and Chris Farley from the show in 1995. Sandler used his firing as part of his monologue when he returned in 2019 to host the show.\nIn 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film Coneheads with fellow SNL performers Farley, David Spade, Dan Aykroyd, Phil Hartman, and Jane Curtin. In 1994, he co-starred in Airheads with Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi.\n\n\n=== 1995–2014: Commercial success ===\n\nSandler starred in Billy Madison (1995) playing a grown man repeating grades 1–12 to earn back his father's respect and the right to inherit his father's multimillion-dollar hotel empire. The film was successful at the box office despite negative reviews. He followed this film with Bulletproof (1996), and the financially successful comedies Happy Gilmore (1996) and The Wedding Singer (1998), his first collaboration with Drew Barrymore. He was initially cast in the bachelor party-themed comedy/thriller Very Bad Things (1998) but had to back out due to his involvement in The Waterboy (1998), one of his first big hits.\nSandler continued making successful comedy films including Big Daddy (1999), Mr. Deeds (2002), Anger Management (2003), 50 First Dates (2004, his second  collaboration with Drew Barrymore), The Longest Yard (2005), and Click (2006).  He also formed his film production company, Happy Madison Productions, in 1999, first producing fellow SNL alumnus Rob Schneider's film Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo. The company has produced most of Sandler's subsequent films to date, and is on the Sony/Columbia Pictures lot in Culver City, California. Most of its films have received negative reviews from critics, with three considered among the worst ever made yet most have performed well at the box office.\nAlthough his earlier commercially successful films did not receive favorable critical attention, Sandler started to receive more positive reviews beginning with his more dramatic role in Punch-Drunk Love in 2002. Punch-Drunk Love's writer and director, Paul Thomas Anderson, had an \"obsession-level\" love for Sandler's previous movies and wrote the film with him in mind. Sandler was intimidated to work with Anderson upon viewing his previous film Magnolia (1999), but these fears were alleviated upon receiving the script from Anderson. Roger Ebert's review of Punch-Drunk Love concluded that Sandler had been wasted in earlier films with poorly written scripts and characters with no development. Ebert noted that Sandler's character still maintained the \"childlike, love-starved\" persona from his previous films, but was shown in a new light as the \"key to all Adam Sandler films\". Sandler was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance. The film marked the beginning of Sandler moving outside the genre of slapstick comedy to take on more serious roles, such as Mike Binder's Reign Over Me (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family in the September 11 attacks and then struggles to rekindle a friendship with his old college roommate (Don Cheadle).\n\nSandler starred alongside friend Kevin James in the film I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry (2007), and headlined You Don't Mess with the Zohan (2008). The latter was written by Sandler, Judd Apatow, and Robert Smigel, and directed by Dennis Dugan. That same year, Sandler starred along with Keri Russell and English comedian Russell Brand in Adam Shankman's children's fantasy film Bedtime Stories (2008), as a stressed hotel maintenance worker whose bedtime stories he reads to his niece and nephew begin to come true. It marked Sandler's first family film and first film under the Disney banner.\nIn 2009, Sandler starred in Apatow's third directorial feature, Funny People, a comedy drama about a famous comedian (Sandler) with a terminal illness. The film was released on July 31, 2009. After its release, Funny People and Punch-Drunk Love were cited in the June 2010 announcement that Sandler was one of 135 people (including 20 actors) invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn 2010, Sandler appeared in Grown Ups, alongside Kevin James, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph. Sandler and Dickie Roberts scribe Fred Wolf wrote the script and Dennis Dugan directed. Sandler's later comedy films, including Grown Ups and Grown Ups 2, received largely negative reviews. Reviewing the latter, critic Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times remarked that Sandler had become the antithesis of Judd Apatow; he was instead \"the white Tyler Perry: smart enough to know better, savvy enough to do it anyway, lazy enough not to care.\" The next year, Sandler starred with Jennifer Aniston in the romantic comedy film Just Go with It. He also voiced a capuchin monkey in Kevin James's Zookeeper, released on July 8, 2011. In 2012, he starred in That's My Boy, as a man who fathered a son (Andy Samberg) with his teacher (Eva Amurri) in high school. In 2013, he guest starred in the Disney Channel Original Series Jessie as himself in the episode \"Punched Dumped Love\". He and Jessie star Cameron Boyce had worked together in Grown Ups and Grown Ups 2; Sandler's 2020 film Hubie Halloween was dedicated to Boyce's memory. Sandler next reunited with Drew Barrymore for a third time in the Warner Bros. romantic comedy Blended, which was filmed in South Africa and released on May 23, 2014.\n\n\n=== 2014–present: Final theatrical films and switch to Netflix ===\nIn October 2014, Netflix announced a four-movie deal with Sandler and Happy Madison Productions. Also that year, Sandler co-starred in the drama film Men, Women & Children, directed by Jason Reitman. He was considered for the voice of Rocket Raccoon in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy but Bradley Cooper was cast instead.\nIn 2015, Sandler released his last theatrical film, Pixels, based on French director Patrick Jean's 2010 short film of the same name, before transitioning into a distribution deal with Netflix.\nSandler's first original film for Netflix was the Western comedy film The Ridiculous 6. Despite being universally panned by critics, on January 6, 2016, it was announced by Netflix that the film had been viewed more times in 30 days than any other movie in Netflix history. Sandler also starred in another Netflix film in 2016, titled The Do-Over.\nSandler starred in the 2017 Netflix film Sandy Wexler, in which he plays a talent manager who falls in love with one of his clients. He returned to dramatic territory in 2017 with Noah Baumbach's family drama The Meyerowitz Stories. In the film, Sandler plays Danny Meyerowitz, who is unemployed and separated from his wife, and who is experiencing dysfunctional relationships with his brother (Ben Stiller), his sister (Elizabeth Marvel), and his father (Dustin Hoffman). The film premiered in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival where his performance received favorable notices from critics. Peter Debruge, film critic for Variety, wrote of his performance, \"With no shtick to fall back on, Sandler is forced to act, and it's a glorious thing to watch\".\n\nIn 2018, Sandler starred in the Netflix film The Week Of alongside Chris Rock. He also starred in a Netflix stand-up special Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh, which was part of his company's Netflix deal and marked his first stand-up film in over two decades. The special was directed by longtime collaborator Steven Brill, while portions of the special were filmed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which marked Sandler’s first project with Anderson since Punch-Drunk Love sixteen years prior.\nOn May 4, 2019, Sandler made his first appearance as host of Saturday Night Live, ending the episode with a tribute to his friend and fellow former cast member Chris Farley. Sandler received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series nomination for his hosting stint. In June 2019, he reunited with Jennifer Aniston in the Netflix film Murder Mystery, which broke the record for the biggest opening weekend in the company's history, and spawned a sequel, Murder Mystery 2, in 2023.\nIn December 2019, Sandler starred in the crime thriller Uncut Gems, directed by the Safdie brothers. The movie and Sandler's acting received critical acclaim and many end-of-year awards from critics, who noted this role as a career best for Sandler, for which he earned the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead.\nIn January 2020, Netflix announced a new four-movie deal with Happy Madison Productions worth up to $275 million. Sandler starred in and wrote the 2020 Netflix film Hubie Halloween. In addition he voiced Leo the lizard in a Netflix's animated coming-of-age musical Leo.\nSandler produced and starred in the 2022 sports drama film Hustle, which received critical acclaim. His performance in the film was repeatedly singled out for praise and he received a nomination for a Screen Actors Guild Award.

In March 2024, Forbes announced that Sandler was the best-paid actor in Hollywood in 2023, earning $73 million.\n\n\n== Public image ==\nSandler has been referenced multiple times in various media, including in the TV shows The Simpsons, in the episode \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\", in the Family Guy episode \"Stew-Roids\", and in the South Park episode \"You're Getting Old\". He was also referenced in the video game Half-Life: Opposing Force. The HBO series Animals episode \"The Trial\" features a mock court case to decide whether Sandler or Jim Carrey is a better comedian.\nIn 2021, Vogue named Sandler the year's fashion icon for popularizing a \"grocery-run look\", characterized by oversized T-shirts, XXL pants, and Nike sneakers dubbed as \"Adam Sandler style\". Menswear brand Old Jewish Men sells a line of basketball shorts inspired by the style. Speaking on the title with Esquire, Sandler remarked: \"It took a while. I was working that angle for years. For a while I was like, 'Please accept me and the way I dress.' And 30 years later, they finally came around.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nSandler has been married to Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Sandler (née Titone) since 2003. She converted to Sandler's religion, Judaism. The couple has two daughters, Sadie (born May 2006) and Sunny (born November 2008). Sandler is the son-in-law of politician Joseph H. Titone.

        "title": "Billy Joel",
        "content": "William Martin Joel (; born May 9, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and pianist. Nicknamed the \"Piano Man\" after his signature 1973 song of the same name, Joel has had a successful career as a solo artist since the 1970s. From 1971 to 1993, he released 12 studio albums spanning the genres of pop and rock, and in 2001 released a one-off studio album of classical compositions. With over 160 million records sold worldwide, Joel is one of the world's best-selling music artists and is the fourth-best-selling solo artist in the United States. His 1985 compilation album, Greatest Hits – Volume I & Volume II, is one of the best-selling albums in the United States.\nJoel was born in the Bronx in New York City and grew up in Hicksville on Long Island, where he began taking piano lessons at his mother's insistence. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, the Hassles and Attila, before signing a record deal with Family Productions and embarking on a solo career with his debut album, Cold Spring Harbor (1971). In 1972, Joel caught the attention of Columbia Records after a live radio performance of \"Captain Jack\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company, through which he released his second album, Piano Man (1973). After Streetlife Serenade (1974) and Turnstiles (1976), Joel achieved his critical and commercial breakthrough with The Stranger (1977). It became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning the hit singles \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\", \"Only the Good Die Young\", and \"She's Always a Woman\", as well as the concert staples \"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\" and \"Vienna\".\nJoel's 52nd Street (1978) was his first album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Glass Houses (1980) was an attempt to further establish himself as a rock artist; it featured \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" (Joel's first single to top the Billboard Hot 100), \"You May Be Right\", \"Don't Ask Me Why\", and \"Sometimes a Fantasy\". The Nylon Curtain (1982) stemmed from a desire to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. An Innocent Man (1983) served as an homage to genres of music that Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as rhythm and blues and doo-wop; it featured \"Tell Her About It\", \"Uptown Girl\", and \"The Longest Time\", three of his best-known songs. After River of Dreams (1993), Joel largely retired from producing studio material, although he went on to release Fantasies & Delusions (2001), featuring classical compositions composed by him and performed by British-Korean pianist Richard Hyung-ki Joo. Joel provided voiceover work in 1988 for the Disney animated film Oliver & Company, performing the song \"Why Should I Worry?\", and contributed to the soundtracks to several films, including Easy Money (1983), Ruthless People (1986), A League of Their Own (1992), and Honeymoon in Vegas (1992). Joel returned to composing new music with the 2024 single \"Turn the Lights Back On\".\nJoel has had a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe. In 1987, he became one of the first artists to hold a rock tour in the Soviet Union. Joel has had 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"Tell Her About It\", and \"We Didn't Start the Fire\") topped the Billboard Hot 100. He has been nominated for 23 Grammy Awards, winning six, including Album of the Year for 52nd Street. Joel was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006. He received the 2001 Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and was recognized at the 2013 Kennedy Center Honors.\n\n\n== Early life, family and education ==\nWilliam Martin Joel was born on May 9, 1949, in the Bronx, New York. At age one, his family moved to Hicksville in the town of Oyster Bay on Long Island. Joel and his cousin Judy, whom his parents adopted, were raised in a nondescript house similar to those in nearby Levittown.\nHis mother, Rosalind (1922–2014), was born in Brooklyn to Jewish parents, Philip and Rebecca Nyman, who emigrated from England. Billy's father, Howard (born Helmut) Joel (1923–2011), an accomplished amateur classical pianist and businessman, was born in Nuremberg, Germany to a Jewish family, the only child of merchant and manufacturer Karl Amson Joel, and educated in Switzerland. In 1928, Karl Joel set up a prosperous mail-order textile company, Joel Macht Fabrik, which within 10 years had become the second largest of its type in Germany. Escaping the Nazi regime, Karl, his wife and young son emigrated to Switzerland. Following the passing of laws which prevented Jews from owning property and businesses, in 1938 he was forced to sell his company to Josef Neckermann for a fraction of its true value. As direct entry to the United States was difficult for German Jews due to strict quotas imposed by the Immigration Act of 1924, the family reached the country via Cuba, where they arrived in early 1939 and stayed for nearly two years. In the United States, Howard became an engineer but always loved music.\nJoel's parents met in 1942, whilst taking part in a production of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Pirates of Penzance at the City College of New York. He has said that neither of his parents talked much about World War II. It was not until later that Joel learned more about his father's family. After Rosalind and Howard Joel divorced in 1957, Howard returned to Europe, as he had never liked the United States: he considered the people uneducated and materialistic. Howard settled in Vienna, Austria, and later remarried. Joel has a half-brother, Alexander Joel, born to his father in England, who became a classical conductor in Europe and was the chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig from 2001 to 2014.\nAt age four, Joel reluctantly began taking piano lessons at his mother's insistence. His teachers included the noted American pianist Morton Estrin and musician Timothy Ford. Joel says that he is a better organist than a pianist. As a teenager, Joel took up boxing and competed on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit as a welterweight. He abandoned the sport after his nose was broken, having won 22 of his 26 fights.\nAlthough Joel's parents were Jewish, he did not grow up in the religion. Joel stated: \"I was not brought up Jewish in any religious way. My circumcision was as Jewish as they got.\" He attended a Roman Catholic church with friends. At age 11, Joel was baptized in a Church of Christ in Hicksville. He now identifies as a Jewish atheist.\nJoel attended Hicksville High School until 1967 but did not graduate with his class. He was playing at a piano bar to help support himself, his mother and sister, and missed a crucial English exam after playing a late-night gig the evening before. Although Joel was a comparatively strong student, at the end of his senior year, he did not have enough credits to graduate. Rather than attend summer school to earn his diploma, Joel decided to begin a music career: \"I told them, 'To hell with it. If I'm not going to Columbia University, I'm going to Columbia Records, and you don't need a high school diploma over there'.\" In 1992, he submitted essays to the school board in lieu of the missed exam. They were accepted, and he was awarded his diploma at Hicksville High's annual graduation ceremony 25 years after leaving.\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\n\n=== 1964–1970: Early career ===\nAlthough Joel's compositions are infused with references to classical music, his tightly-structured melodies and down-to-earth songwriting betray the influence of early rock & roll and rhythm & blues artists, including Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers. However, it was only after seeing the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show that he decided to pursue a career in music. As he later commented:\n\nThat one performance changed my life ... Up to that moment I'd never considered playing rock as a career ... (W)hen I saw four guys who didn't look like they'd come out of the Hollywood star mill, who played their own songs and instruments, and especially because you could see this look in John Lennon's face—and he looked like he was always saying: '--- you!'—I said: 'I know these guys, I can relate to these guys, I am these guys. This is what I'm going to do—play in a rock band'.\nAt age 16, Joel joined the Echoes, a group which specialized in British Invasion covers. The Echoes began recording in 1965. Joel played piano on several records released through Kama Sutra Productions and on recordings produced by Shadow Morton. He played on a demo version of \"Leader of the Pack\", which in 1964 became a major hit for the Shangri-Las, and has said that he was also on the demo or master recording of their song \"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\". The released single included a co-producer credit for Artie Ripp, who later was the first to sign and produce Joel as a solo artist after Michael Lang, who had given Joel a monetary advance, passed Joel along to Ripp to focus his attentions elsewhere.\nIn late 1965, the Echoes changed their name briefly to the Emeralds, and then to the Lost Souls. Joel left the band in 1967 to join the Hassles, a Long Island group that had signed with United Artists Records. Over the next year and a half, they released four singles and two albums (The Hassles and Hour of the Wolf). However, all were commercial failures. Joel and drummer Jon Small left the Hassles in 1969 to form the duo Attila, releasing an eponymous debut album in July 1970. The duo disbanded the following October when Joel began an affair with Small's wife, Elizabeth. The pair later married.\n\n\n=== 1970–1974: Cold Spring Harbor and Piano Man ===\nJoel signed a contract with the record company Family Productions, with which he recorded his first solo album, Cold Spring Harbor, named for Cold Spring Harbor, a hamlet on his native Long Island. Artie Ripp, owner of Family Productions, states that he spent US$450,000 developing Joel; nevertheless, the album was mastered at too high a speed and was a technical and commercial disappointment.\nThe popular songs \"She's Got a Way\" and \"Everybody Loves You Now\" were originally released on this album, but went largely unnoticed until being released as live performances on Songs in the Attic (1981). Columbia released a remastered version of Cold Spring Harbor in 1983, with certain songs shortened or re-orchestrated.\nJoel began his Cold Spring Harbor tour in the fall of 1971, touring with his band, consisting of Rhys Clark on drums, Al Hertzberg on guitar, and Larry Russell on bass guitar, throughout the mainland United States and Puerto Rico, opening for such artists as the J. Geils Band, the Beach Boys, Badfinger and Taj Mahal. Joel's performance at the Puerto Rican Mar y Sol Pop Festival was especially well-received; and although recorded, Joel refused to have it published on the Mar Y Sol compilation album Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival. Nevertheless, interest in his music grew.\n\nOn April 15, 1972, WMMR-FM radio in Philadelphia featured a live broadcast of Joel performing 12 songs, and a recording of the set was played several times by station DJ Jonathan Takiff on his late-night weekend show. As a result, \"Captain Jack\" became the most requested track in the station's history, and after receiving regular airplay, was soon an underground hit on the East Coast. Herb Gordon, a Columbia Records executive, heard Joel's music and brought him to the attention of company president Clive Davis. Joel signed a recording contract with the label in 1972 and moved to Los Angeles, where he lived for the next three years. For six months, Joel worked at The Executive Room piano bar on Wilshire Boulevard as \"Bill Martin\". During that time, he composed his signature song \"Piano Man\" about the bar's patrons.\nDespite Joel's new contract, he was legally bound to Family Productions. Artie Ripp sold Joel's first contract to Columbia. Walter Yetnikoff, the president of CBS/Columbia Records at the time, bought back the rights to Joel's songs in the late 1970s, giving the rights to Joel as a birthday gift. Yetnikoff notes in the documentary The Last Play at Shea that he had to threaten Ripp to close the deal.\n\nJoel's first album with Columbia was Piano Man (1973). Despite modest sales, the album's title track became his signature song, ending nearly every concert. That same year, Joel's touring band changed. Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by Doug Stegmeyer, who stayed with Joel until 1989. Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; Johnny Almond joined as saxophonist and keyboardist. The band toured the U.S. and Canada extensively, appearing on popular music shows. Joel's songwriting began attracting more attention; in 1974, Helen Reddy recorded the Piano Man track \"You're My Home\".\n\n\n=== 1974–1977: Streetlife Serenade and Turnstiles ===\nIn 1974, Joel recorded his second Columbia album in Los Angeles, Streetlife Serenade. His manager at the time was Jon Troy, an old friend from New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood; Troy was soon replaced by Joel's wife Elizabeth. Streetlife Serenade contains references to suburbia and the inner city. It is perhaps best known for \"The Entertainer\", a No. 34 hit in the U.S. Upset that \"Piano Man\" had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote \"The Entertainer\" as a sarcastic response: \"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\" Although Streetlife Serenade was viewed unfavorably by critics, it contains the notable songs \"Los Angelenos\" and \"Root Beer Rag\", an instrumental that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.\nIn late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on Bo Diddley's The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll all-star album.\nDisenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1975 and recorded Turnstiles (1976), the first album to feature his regular touring band. Produced by James William Guercio (then Chicago's producer), Turnstiles was first recorded at Caribou Ranch with members of Elton John's band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.\n\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" was a minor hit, covered by Ronnie Spector and Nigel Olsson. During a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \"shreds\" his vocal cords; however, Joel did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the Hollywood Bowl in May 2014. Although never released as a single, \"New York State of Mind\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; Barbra Streisand recorded a cover and Tony Bennett performed it as a duet with Joel on Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues. Other notable songs from the album include \"Summer, Highland Falls\"; \"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\" and \"Prelude/Angry Young Man\", a concert mainstay.\n\n\n=== 1977–1979: The Stranger and 52nd Street ===\n\nDuring the Turnstiles tour, Joel's wife Elizabeth phoned George Martin in an attempt to recruit him as the producer for Joel's next album, but having seen the artist play live at Glassboro State College in New Jersey, Martin declined the invitation. Prior to the tour, Joel had expressed to his wife a desire to work with Phil Ramone at some point. She now contacted the legendary producer, who attended Joel's concert at New York's Carnegie Hall on June 2, 1977 (as did Don DeVito from Columbia Records, who brought with him a recording truck to tape the show). Impressed by what he saw, Ramone went on to produce all seven studio albums Joel recorded from 1977 to 1986.\nThe Stranger (1977) was an enormous commercial success, yielding four Top-25 hits on the Billboard charts: \"Just the Way You Are\" (No. 3), \"Movin' Out\" (No. 17), \"Only the Good Die Young\" (No. 24) and \"She's Always a Woman\" (No. 17). Joel's first Top Ten album, The Stranger reached number two on the charts and was certified multi-platinum, besting Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge over Troubled Water as Columbia's previous bestselling album. \"Just the Way You Are\" — written for Joel's first wife, Elizabeth Weber — was inspired by a dream and won Grammy awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. On tour in Paris, Joel learned the news late one night in a hotel room.  It also featured \"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\", an album-oriented rock classic, which has become one of his best-known songs. It is one of Joel's favorite of his own songs, which has become a firm staple of his live shows, and \"Vienna\", also one of Joel's personal favorites, and one of his most streamed songs on the internet as of 2022. Rolling Stone later ranked The Stranger the 70th greatest album of all time.\n\nJoel released 52nd Street in 1978, naming it after Manhattan's 52nd Street, which, at the time of its release, served as the world headquarters of CBS/ Columbia. The album sold over seven million copies, propelled to number one on the charts by the hits \"My Life\" (No. 3), \"Big Shot\" (No. 14) and \"Honesty\" (No. 24). A cover of \"My Life\" by Gary Bennett became the theme for the television sitcom Bosom Buddies. 52nd Street also won Grammy awards for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male and Album of the Year.\nIn 1978, Joel gave his first of what would go on to be at least 150 shows at New York City's Madison Square Garden. In 2025, Joel described playing at the arena as being a \"dream come true\". He currently dominates the record for most concerts performed at Madison Square Garden.\nIn 1979, Joel traveled to Havana, Cuba to participate in the historic Havana Jam festival from March 2–4, alongside Rita Coolidge, Kris Kristofferson, Stephen Stills, the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the Trio of Doom, Fania All-Stars, Billy Swan, Bonnie Bramlett, Mike Finnegan, Weather Report, and an array of Cuban artists including Irakere, Pacho Alonso, Tata Güines and Orquesta Aragón. Although Joel's performance was for many the highlight of the weekend, CBS were unable to record or film it as planned because his wife objected to the fact that a specific deal had not been agreed with them in advance. He was interviewed about his experience of playing at the event for Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary Havana Jam '79.\n52nd Street was the first commercially released album on the then-new compact disc format, in 1982.\n\n\n=== 1979–1983: Glass Houses and The Nylon Curtain ===\nThe success of his piano-driven ballads like \"Just the Way You Are\", \"She's Always a Woman\" and \"Honesty\" led some critics to label Joel a \"balladeer\" and \"soft rocker\". He thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with Glass Houses, Joel tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of new wave rock music that was starting to become popular. Joel stated that the album cover, which pictured him wearing a leather jacket and about to throw a rock at a window of his Long Island home, was intended as a riposte to his image as a \"mellow balladeer\".\nGlass Houses spent six weeks at the top of the Billboard album chart, yielding the hits \"You May Be Right\" (No. 7, May 1980), \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", (No. 1, July 1980), \"Don't Ask Me Why\" (No. 19, September 1980) and \"Sometimes a Fantasy\" (No. 36, November 1980). The latter song gave its name to a 15-minute promotional film featuring both music and dialog, which as Joel's first venture of this kind, he wrote and directed himself. \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" was his first number one on the Billboard Hot 100, where it spent 11 weeks in the top 10 and became the ninth biggest-selling single of the year.. His five sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in 1980 earned him the venue's Gold Ticket Award for selling more than 100,000 tickets.\nGlass Houses won the 1981 Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It also won the American Music Award for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, \"Through the Long Night\" (B-side of the \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by the Beatles' \"Yes It Is\". In a recorded master class at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel recalled that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.\nJoel's next release, Songs in the Attic, was composed of live performances of lesser-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded at larger US arenas and in intimate nightclub shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when The Stranger became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the Billboard chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over three million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, it was still considered a success by Joel.\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of The Nylon Curtain. With it, Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, which included highly topical songs like \"Allentown\" and \"Goodnight Saigon\". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about the American Dream and how changes in American politics during the Reagan administration meant that \"all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.\" He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to \"create a sonic masterpiece\" on The Nylon Curtain. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album. Production of The Nylon Curtain began in the fall of 1981, but was delayed for several months after Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on April 15, 1982. The bone in his left thumb was crushed and his other wrist dislocated in the incident, when he hit and was flipped over a car which had run a red light at an intersection on Long Island.\nIn October 1982, Joel embarked on a brief tour to support the album, and recorded his first video special, Live from Long Island, at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York on December 29. This was first broadcast on HBO on July 24, 1983, before being released on VHS. At the following year's Grammy Awards,it was nominated for the Best Video Album.\nThe Nylon Curtain went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles \"Allentown\" and \"Pressure\", both directed by Russell Mulcahy.\n\n\n=== 1983–1988: An Innocent Man and The Bridge ===\nJoel's next album moved away from the serious themes of The Nylon Curtain and struck a much lighter tone. An Innocent Man was Joel's tribute to R&B and doo wop music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second Billboard number-one hit, \"Tell Her About It\", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"\nAt the time that the album was released, WCBS-FM began playing \"Uptown Girl\" both in regular rotation and on the Doo Wop Live. The song became a worldwide hit when released as a single. Originally entitled \"Uptown Girls\", it was inspired by a chance encounter with Christie Brinkley, Whitney Houston, and Elle Macpherson, who were on a modelling assignment in the Caribbean when they approached Joel whilst he was playing the piano in the bar of their hotel (where he was a holiday guest). The accompanying music video featured Brinkley as a high-society girl who pulls her Rolls-Royce into the gas station where Joel's character is working. At the end of the video, Joel's \"grease monkey\" character drives off with his \"uptown girl\" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.\nIn December, the title song was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, \"The Longest Time\" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, \"Leave a Tender Moment Alone\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"Keeping the Faith\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Brinkley appears as a passenger in a convertible Chevrolet. An Innocent Man was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to Michael Jackson's Thriller.\n\nJoel participated in the USA for Africa \"We Are the World\" project in 1985. Following An Innocent Man, Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"You're Only Human (Second Wind)\" and \"The Night Is Still Young\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. Greatest Hits was highly successful and it has since been certified double diamond by the RIAA, with over 11.5 million copies (23 million units) sold. It is one of the best-selling albums in American music history, according to the RIAA.\nCoinciding with the Greatest Hits album release, Joel released a two-volume Video Album that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to that time. Along with videos for the new singles off the Greatest Hits album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\nJoel's next album, The Bridge (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"A Matter of Trust\" and \"Modern Woman\" (both No. 10) from the film Ruthless People, a dark comedy from the directors of Airplane!. The ballad \"This is the Time\" also charted, peaking at No. 18. On November 18, 1986, an extended version of \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\" was used on a Season 3 episode of Moonlighting.The Bridge was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel was unsatisfied with most of the songs on The Bridge, but his record company denied a request for time to produce better material. In a 2008 interview, he described it as \"not a good album'.\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union. This was realised the following July, when he arrived in the country with his wife, daughter Alexa, and full touring band. Following an improvised performance in Tbilisi, Joel gave six concerts at indoor arenas in Moscow and Leningrad, to a combined audience possibly in excess of 100,000 people. The entourage was filmed for television and video to offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world. Joel's Russian tour was the first live rock radio broadcast in Soviet history. The tour was later cited frequently as one of the first fully staged pop rock shows to come to the Soviet Union, although in reality other artists had previously toured in the country, including Elton John, James Taylor, and Bonnie Raitt.\nMost of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel's energetic show, something that had never happened in other countries he had performed in. According to Joel, each time the fans were hit with the bright lights, anybody who seemed to be enjoying themselves froze. In addition, people who were \"overreacting\" were removed by security. During this concert, Joel, enraged by the bright lights, flipped his electric piano and snapped a microphone stand while continuing to sing. Joel later apologized for the incident.\nThe concerts in Russia came after an intensive series of European shows, and after doing interviews during the day, Joel found himself playing at venues where the PA system was \"second rate at best\". Released against his wishes in October 1987, КОНЦЕРТ (Russian for \"Concert\"), a live double album recorded during the tour,, included cover versions of Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are a-Changin\" and \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" by the Beatles. The latter was released as a single but failed to make the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, and the album was Joel's first since Cold Spring Harbor not to achieve gold disc status. Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1 million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.\n\n\n=== 1988–1993: Storm Front and River of Dreams ===\nThe animated film Oliver & Company (1988) features Joel in a rare voice acting role as Dodger, a sarcastic Jack Russell based on Dickens's Artful Dodger. The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\nThe recording of Storm Front, which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90 million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, and in January 1990, Joel was awarded US$2 million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30 million countersuit filed by Weber.\nThe first single for the album, \"We Didn't Start the Fire\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third—and most recent—US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. Storm Front was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since Glass Houses, nine years earlier. Storm Front was Joel's first album since Turnstiles to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with Mick Jones of Foreigner. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones's 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones's single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer Liberty DeVitto, guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player Mark Rivera, and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero.\nStorm Front's second single, \"I Go to Extremes\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"Leningrad\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"The Downeaster Alexa\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"And So It Goes\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for An Innocent Man; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until Storm Front. Joel said in a 1996 master class session in Pittsburgh that Storm Front was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\nIn September 1992, Joel filed a US$90 million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract. The case was settled out of court in the fall of 1993 for US$3 million paid to Joel by third party Sony America, to protect its subsidiary Sony Music's interests, as it had several other artists also using Grubman's law firm.\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo Sam & Dave into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on River of Dreams, finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by Christie Brinkley that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on Billboard's Hot 100 and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"All About Soul\" (with Color Me Badd on backing vocals) and \"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\", written for his daughter, Alexa. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on The Essential Billy Joel (2001), and a demo version appears on My Lives (2005).\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at Madison Square Garden, December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n\n=== 1994–2013: Touring and new singles ===\n\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with Elton John on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history. During these shows, the two played their own songs, sang each other's songs, and performed duets. They grossed over US$46 million in just 24 dates in their sold out 2003 tour. Joel and John resumed their Face to Face tour in March 2009 and it continued until March 2010, where it ended in Albany, New York, at the Times Union Center. In February 2010, Joel denied rumors in the trade press that he canceled a summer 2010 leg of the tour, claiming there were never any dates booked and that he intended to take the year off. Joel told Rolling Stone: \"We'll probably pick it up again. It's always fun playing with him.\"\n\nJoel and Christie Brinkley announced on April 13, 1994, that they had separated, and their divorce was finalized in August 1994. The two remained friends.\n\nJoel's Greatest Hits Volume III yielded \"To Make You Feel My Love\" (a Bob Dylan cover) and \"Hey Girl\". During his Central Park concert in 1997, Joel performed with Garth Brooks, who had reached No. 1 on Billboard's country charts in 1991 with a recording of the song \"Shameless\" from Joel's 1989 album.  On March 15, 1999, Joel was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Ray Charles. In his speech, Charles mentioned \"Baby Grand\", the duet Joel had written for the them which appeared on his 1986 album The Bridge.\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's Madison Square Garden. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" and \"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert.\nIn 2001, Joel released Fantasies & Delusions, a collection of classical piano pieces composed by Joel and performed by Hyung-ki Joo. Joel often uses bits of these pieces as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show Movin' Out. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\", at the Concert for New York City in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"Your Song\" with Elton John.\nIn 2003, Joel inducted The Righteous Brothers into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"Until the Night\" from the album 52nd Street was a tribute to the duo.\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, My Lives, which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions, and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the software that permits people to remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. A DVD of a show from the River of Dreams tour is included.\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not released any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as deep cuts like \"Zanzibar\" and \"All for Leyna\". Between January 23 and April 24, his 12 performances at Madison Square Garden broke the venue's record for the most consecutive sold-out concerts by an artist during the same tour (the previous best was 10 shows, set by Bruce Springsteen in 2000). This achievement earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena's history to be given to a non-athlete. The same honor has been bestowed on Joel at Xfinity Mobile Arena (formerly the Wells Fargo Center) in Philadelphia, where a banner in the colors of the Philadelphia Flyers is hung honoring Joel's 48 sold-out Philadelphia shows. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released 12 Gardens Live, a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.\nJoel visited the United Kingdom and Ireland for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour. On July 31, 2006, Joel performed a free concert in Rome, with the Colosseum as the backdrop.\n\nJoel toured South Africa, Australia, Japan and Hawaii in late 2006, and subsequently toured the Southeastern U.S. in February and March 2007 before hitting the Midwest in the spring of 2007. A new song, titled \"All My Life\", was Joel's newest single (with second track \"You're My Home\", live from Madison Square Garden 2006 tour) and was released in stores on February 27, 2007. On February 4, Joel sang the national anthem for Super Bowl XLI, becoming the second to sing the national anthem twice at a Super Bowl, after Aaron Neville.\nOn December 1, 2007, Joel premiered his new song \"Christmas in Fallujah\". The song was performed by Cass Dillon, a new Long Island based musician, as Joel felt it should be sung by someone in a soldier's age range (though he himself has played the song occasionally in concert.) The track was dedicated to servicemen based in Iraq. Joel wrote it in September 2007 after reading numerous letters sent to him from American soldiers in Iraq. \"Christmas in Fallujah\" is only the second pop/rock song released by Joel since 1993's River of Dreams. Proceeds from the song benefited the Homes For Our Troops foundation.\n\nOn January 26, 2008, Joel performed with the Philadelphia Orchestra at the city's Academy of Music 151st anniversary concert. The event premiered an orchestral version of his classical piano piece \"Waltz No. 2 (Steinway Hall)\" from Fantasies & Delusions, arranged by Brad Ellis and the composer. Accompied throughout by the orchestra, Joel's 44-minute set included some of his lesser-known songs, such as \"Scandinavian Skies\" and \"Where's the Orchestra?\" from The Nylon Curtain, as well as \"Uptown Girl\", which he had largely dropped from his live repertoire. The concert and associated ball were part of the Academy's fund-raising efforts to establish a \"Billy Joel Fund for Music Education\", to which the singer donated his fee for the evening.\nOn March 10, 2008, Joel inducted his friend John Mellencamp into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nJoel sold out 10 concerts at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut from May to July 2008. The casino honored him with a banner displaying his name and the number 10 to hang in the arena. On June 19, 2008, Joel played a concert at the grand re-opening of Caesars Windsor (formerly Casino Windsor) in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, to an invite-only crowd for Casino VIPs. His mood was light and joke-filled, even introducing himself as \"Billy Joel's dad\" and stating \"you guys overpaid to see a fat bald guy\". He also admitted that Canadian folk-pop musician Gordon Lightfoot was the musical inspiration for \"She's Always A Woman\".\nOn July 16 and 18, 2008, Joel played the final concerts at Shea Stadium before its demolition. His guests included Tony Bennett, Don Henley, John Mayer, John Mellencamp, Steven Tyler, Roger Daltrey, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney. The concerts were featured in the 2010 documentary film Last Play at Shea. The film was released on DVD on February 8, 2011. The CD and DVD of the show, Live at Shea Stadium, were released a month later on March 8.\nOn December 11, 2008, Joel recorded his own rendition of \"Christmas in Fallujah\" during a concert at Acer Arena in Sydney and released it as a live single in Australia only. It is the only official release of Joel performing \"Christmas in Fallujah\", as Cass Dillon sang on the 2007 studio recording and the handful of times the song was played live in 2007.,Joel sang the song throughout his December 2008 tour of Australia.\n\nOn May 19, 2009, Joel's former drummer, Liberty DeVitto, filed a lawsuit in New York City claiming he was owed over 10 years of royalty payments by Joel and Sony Music. DeVitto had never been given songwriting or arranging credit on any of Joel's songs, but he claimed that he helped arrange some of them, including \"Only the Good Die Young\". In April 2010, it was announced that Joel and DeVitto amicably resolved the lawsuit.\nTo mark the 40th anniversary of the release of Joel's debut album, Cold Spring Harbor, it was announced on his official website that Columbia/Legacy Recordings planned \"to celebrate the occasion with a definitive reissue project of newly restored and expanded Legacy editions of Joel's complete catalog, newly curated collections of rarities from the vaults, previously unavailable studio tracks and live performances, home video releases and more\", although this project was never fully realized. Piano Man was re-released in a two-disc Legacy edition in November 2011, with Joel's 1972 live radio concert at WMMR-FM in Philadelphia comprising the second disc.\nIn 2012, Joel signed an exclusive worldwide publishing agreement with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) and its subsidiary Rondor Music International, who together replaced EMI Music Publishing in managing his catalog outside the US. Additionally, the agreement marked the first time since Joel regained control of his publishing rights in the 1980s that he began to use an administrator to handle his catalog within the U.S. The agreement's focus is on increasing the use of Joel's music in movies, television programs and commercials.\nOn December 12, 2012, Joel performed as part of 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief at Madison Square Garden, a concert held for all the victims of Hurricane Sandy. He changed the lyrics to \"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\" to make it relate to all the damage caused by Sandy.\nIn May 2013, it was announced that Joel would hold his first ever indoor Irish concert at the O2 in Dublin on November 1.

Joel also performed an unusual set, including the song \"Souvenir\" (from 1974's Streetlife Serenade) and excluding \"We Didn't Start the Fire\".\nIn January 2015, Joel broke the previous record he set in 2006 for most consecutive shows at Madison Square Garden after performing his 13th consecutive show, which also resulted in a new banner being raised to the Madison Square Garden rafters. Throughout 2015, Joel performed 21 concerts in addition to his monthly Madison Square Garden residency. His August 4, 2015, engagement at Nassau Coliseum was the final concert prior to the arena undergoing a US$261 million renovation. Joel returned to Nassau Coliseum on April 5, 2017, to play the first concert at the newly renovated venue. Later that month, he played the first concert at Atlanta's new SunTrust Park, the suburban home of the Atlanta Braves. On June 24, Joel returned to Hicksville High School 50 years after his would-be graduating class received their diplomas, to deliver the honorary commencement address. It was also the 25th anniversary of receiving his own diploma from the same high school.\nOn October 7–8, 2016, Colorado College in Colorado Springs hosted the first academic conference on Joel.

It aired on HBO and HBO Max on July 18, with the second part being shown a week later. Shortly afterwards, a 155-track playlist, comprising 115 songs plus audio clips from the documentary, was released on streaming services. This included previously unreleased live and demo recordings, such as Joel's first live performance of \"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\".\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\nIn 1996, Joel merged his long-held love of boating with his desire for a second career. He and Long Island boating businessman Peter Needham formed the Long Island Boat Company.\nIn November 2010, Joel opened 20th Century Cycles, a vintage motorcycle customization business and museum in Oyster Bay, Long Island.\nIn 2011, Joel announced that he was releasing an autobiography that he had written with Fred Schruers, titled The Book of Joel: A Memoir. The book was originally going to be released in June 2011, but, in March 2011, Joel decided against publishing the book and officially canceled his deal with HarperCollins. Rolling Stone noted, \"HarperCollins acquired the book project for US$3 million in 2008. Joel is expected to return his advance on that sum to the publisher.\" According to Billboard, \"the HarperCollins book was billed as an 'emotional ride' that would detail the music legend's failed marriage to Christie Brinkley, as well as his battles with substance abuse.\" In explaining his decision to cancel the book's release, Joel said, \"It took working on writing a book to make me realize that I'm not all that interested in talking about the past, and that the best expression of my life and its ups and downs has been and remains my music.\" In 2014, Schruers published a biography, simply titled Billy Joel, based on his extensive personal interviews with Joel.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Marriages and family ===\n\nJoel's first wife was Elizabeth Weber Small. When their relationship began, she was married to Jon Small, his music partner in the short-lived duo Attila, with whom she had a son. When the affair was revealed, Weber severed her relationships with both men. Weber and Joel later reconciled and married in 1973, and she then became his manager. They divorced on July 20, 1982.\nJoel married a second time, to model Christie Brinkley, in March 1985. Their daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, was born December 29, 1985. Alexa was given the middle name of Ray after Ray Charles, one of Joel's musical idols. Joel and Brinkley divorced on August 26, 1994. They remain friends, and Joel is the godfather of Brinkley's two youngest children, Jack and Sailor Brinkley Cook.\nOn October 2, 2004, Joel married chef Katie Lee, his third wife. At the time of the wedding, Lee was 23 and Joel was 55. Joel's daughter, Alexa Ray, then 18, served as the maid of honor. Joel's second wife, Christie Brinkley, attended the union and gave the couple her blessing. On June 17, 2009, they announced their separation.\nOn July 4, 2015, Joel married a fourth time, to Alexis Roderick, an equestrian and former Morgan Stanley executive, at his Oyster Bay estate on Long Island. He was 66 and she was 33. Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo conducted the ceremony. The couple has been together since 2009. On August 12, 2015, the couple had a daughter, Della Rose Joel. Their second daughter, Remy Anne Joel, was born on October 22, 2017. His two younger daughters attend school in Florida, where the family now lives.\n\n\n=== Homes ===\nFollowing the birth of their daughter Alexa, in 1986 Joel and his wife Christine Brinkley moved to a house in Amagansett, New York, for which it was reported that he paid US$2.9 million. In 2002, he sold the property to comedian Jerry Seinfeld for US$32.5 million (then the most expensive house purchase in the history of New York State).\nIn 2002, Joel bought an estate in Centre Island, New York in the town of Oyster Bay for US$22 million. He also owns a house in Sag Harbor. In 2023, Joel put his Oyster Bay estate on the market for $49 million. The listing was pulled as the main house was undergoing renovations. The mansion, with its guest houses, pool, beach, and helipad on 26 acres, was again offered for sale in September 2024, asking $49.9 million. \nIn 2015, Joel purchased a home in Manalapan, Florida. The waterfront residence went on the market in November 2015 for $19.5 million but it was taken off the market and re-listed in 2017 with an asking price of $18.5 million. The property was further reduced to $16.9 million in 2018. In January 2020, the 13,200-square-foot property sold for US$10.3 million.\nHaving worked on an oyster dredger as a teenager, Joel has a longstanding interest in nautical matters. In 2009, it was reported that he owned a small flotilla of vessels, overseen by a full-time captain. Several of the craft were based on rough designs by Joel, including a 57 ft (17.4 m) boat with a top speed of 50 mph (80.5 km/h) which he had built to commute from Oyster Bay to Manhattan.\n\n\n=== Health issues ===\nIn 1970, a career decline and personal tragedies led Joel to a deep depressive period. It was revealed in the 2025 documentary Billy Joel: And So It Goes that he tried to commit suicide twice. After Joel's affair with Elizabeth Weber Small resulted in the breakup of Attila, and his estrangement from his best friend Jon Small, Joel was evicted from Small's house. \"I had no place to live. I was sleeping in laundromats and I was depressed, I think to the point of almost being psychotic,\" said Joel. Joel's sister, Judy Molinari, who was a medical assistant at the time, had previously given him sleeping pills to help him sleep. Joel's first suicide attempt occurred when he planned to take an overdose of all the pills. This resulted in Joel falling into a coma for several days. When he awoke, Joel was disappointed that his attempt failed, and swore he would \"do it right\" the second time around. Joel then left a suicide note and attempted to kill himself a second time by drinking furniture polish. Joel later said, \"I drank furniture polish. It looked tastier than bleach.\" Jon Small rushed him to the hospital. Joel checked into Meadowbrook Hospital, where he was put on suicide watch and received treatment for depression. Joel would later pen the song \"Tomorrow Is Today\", which he describes as a suicide note.\nIn 1985, Joel recorded \"You're Only Human (Second Wind)\" as a message to help prevent teen suicide.\nIn 2002, Joel entered Silver Hill Hospital, a substance abuse and psychiatric center in New Canaan, Connecticut, where he underwent treatment for 10 days. In March 2005, Joel checked into the Betty Ford Center, where he spent 30 days for the treatment of alcohol abuse.\nIn 2025, Joel was diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, leading to problems with his hearing, vision, and balance. The diagnosis led to Joel cancelling all his upcoming planned concerts. In July 2025, he stated in interviews People and on Bill Maher's podcast that he was improving, with his condition being treatable.\nJoel has admitted to having a history of alcoholism, though he eventually became sober and has stated that some details regarding his alcohol addiction, such as the claim that Joel reached the point where he received DUI arrests, were exaggerated.\n\n\n=== Political views and contributions ===\nAlthough Joel has donated money to Democratic candidates, he has never publicly affiliated himself with the Democratic Party. Joel rarely publicly endorses political candidates; however, he did play a benefit with his friend Bruce Springsteen to raise money for Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008. Joel has performed at benefit concerts that have helped raise funds for political causes. However, about celebrities endorsing political candidates, Joel has said, \"People who pay for your tickets, I don't think they want to hear who you're going to vote for and how you think they should vote.\"\nIn 2016, after his sarcastic dedication of \"The Entertainer\" to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump was taken as a serious endorsement, Joel told the New York Daily News in an email that he would be voting for Hillary Clinton.\nJoel endorsed Andrew Cuomo’s candidacy for the 2025 New York City mayoral election.\n\n\n== Tours ==\nTours\n\nResidency\n\nBilly Joel at the Garden (2014–2024)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Awards and achievements ==\n\nJoel graduated well after his high school peers because of a missed English exam.

        "title": "Barbarian (2022 film)",
        "content": "Barbarian is a 2022 American horror film written and directed by Zach Cregger in his solo screenwriting and directorial debut. It is produced by Arnon Milchan, Roy Lee, Raphael Margules, and J. D. Lifshitz. The film stars Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgård, and Justin Long. The plot involves a woman finding out that the rental home she reserved has been accidentally double-booked by a man, not knowing of a dark secret within the dwelling.\nBarbarian premiered at San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 9, 2022, by 20th Century Studios. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $45 million worldwide against a budget of about $4 million.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the night before a job interview, Tess Marshall arrives at an Airbnb-rented house in the Detroit neighborhood of Brightmoor. However, she finds it has been double-booked and is already occupied by a man named Keith. Initially unnerved by the situation, Tess warms to Keith and decides to stay the night while he sleeps on the couch. When she awakens during the night, she is shaken to find her bedroom door open, but Keith is asleep and assures her he did not open the door.\nTess goes for her interview the next morning and is cautioned to stay on guard while in the neighborhood around the house, which is suffering from heavy urban decay. Returning to the house, she hurries inside when a stranger runs toward her, urging her to leave. She accidentally locks herself in the basement and stumbles across a hidden corridor, leading to a room with a camera, a stained mattress, a bucket, and a bloody hand print.\nKeith returns to the house and frees Tess from the basement. Ignoring Tess's warning, he investigates the hidden corridor. When he does not return, Tess follows and finds another hidden door and a deeper subterranean tunnel, where she finds Keith injured. While they argue about where to go, Keith is suddenly attacked and killed by a naked, deformed woman known as The Mother who bashes his skull against a wall.\nThe house's owner, an actor named AJ, is fired from a television series over allegations that he raped his co-star. Pressured to sell assets to pay his legal costs, AJ travels to Detroit to inspect the house before selling it. He finds the hidden tunnel and tries to measure it, believing it may increase the house's value. The Mother attacks AJ in the tunnel, and he falls into a pit where he meets Tess. A flashback to 1982 shows Frank, the house's original owner, buying supplies for a home birth, before stalking a woman by gaining access to her home, with the implication that he is going to abduct and murder her.\nIn the present, Tess and AJ are locked in the pit. Tess tells AJ that The Mother wants them to act as her children. AJ is dragged away by The Mother, who forcibly tries to breastfeed him. Tess uses the opportunity to escape the house with the help of the homeless Andre, the stranger from before, who warns her that The Mother will come after her at nightfall.\nWith The Mother distracted by Tess's escape, AJ finds a room which The Mother refuses to approach. Inside, he encounters a bedridden Frank and assumes him to be another victim of The Mother. AJ assures Frank that he will call the police, before finding evidence that Frank had abducted and raped dozens of women. Horrified, AJ berates Frank before Frank kills himself with a concealed revolver.\nTess leads police to the house, but they dismiss her story due to lack of evidence, assuming from her disheveled appearance and lack of identification that she is a delusional drug-addicted squatter, and leave as night falls. Tess breaks back into the house, retrieves her car keys, and drives into The Mother when she leaves the house, seemingly killing her. Tess returns to the basement to rescue AJ, but he mistakenly shoots her with Frank's revolver. AJ helps Tess escape, finding that The Mother's body has vanished, and they take shelter with Andre.\nAndre explains that The Mother is a product of Frank's multi-generational incest with his victims and the daughters he had by them. The Mother bursts in, violently kills Andre and pursues Tess and AJ up a water tower. AJ loses his gun and pushes Tess off the water tower to save himself. The Mother jumps after her and shields her from the fall. AJ finds Tess is still alive, but as he tries to rationalize his actions to Tess, The Mother awakens and gouges his eyes out before splitting his head open. The Mother attempts to comfort Tess, who remorsefully shoots The Mother dead with Frank's gun and limps away as the sun rises.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nZach Cregger was inspired by the non-fiction book The Gift of Fear, citing a section that encourages women to trust their intuition and not ignore the subconscious red flags that arise in their day-to-day interactions with men. He sat down to write a single thirty-page scene that would incorporate as many of these red flags as possible. Cregger settled on a woman showing up to an Airbnb late at night, only to find that it had been double-booked, as the ideal set-up for this exercise. He stuck to the rule that if he was surprising himself with his writing, then he has to be surprising his audience. \"As long as I have no long plan, then no one could know what's coming.\"\nHe became frustrated during the writing process, fearing the direction of the story was too predictable. So Cregger, with no forethought, decided to introduce a twist that would \"flip [the scene] on its head.\"\n\nI just wanted to write a fun scene for myself and it ended up being something that hooked me, and I didn’t know where it was going, and then it turned into a feature film.\nWhile writing the screenplay, Cregger named the film Barbarian as a placeholder. As the story progressed, the name eventually became the title of the film.\nEarly in pre-production, Cregger reportedly reached out to multiple financiers and distributors, including A24 and Neon, but was rejected. J. D. Lifshitz and Raphael Margules agreed to produce the film through their BoulderLight Pictures banner, and were later joined by Vertigo Entertainment, after Lifshitz and Margules reached out to Vertigo's Roy Lee who had served as an early mentor to the duo. In mid-2020, Lifshitz and Margules accrued a $3.5 million budget for the film, largely through foreign financing, most of it from the French production company Logical Pictures.\nZac Efron was the first choice to play AJ, whom Cregger had envisioned as a \"beefcake kind of himbo.\" However, when Efron turned down the role, Cregger decided to take the character's image in a different direction and cast Justin Long for his \"warm and disarming and charming, lovable presence onscreen\" which he thought would make AJ more engaging to audiences.\nThat same year, Lee brought in Bill Skarsgård, who had previously collaborated with Lee on It (2017) and It Chapter Two (2019), to costar and serve as an executive producer. Barbarian began principal photography in early 2021 in Bulgaria. The film was shot in Sofia, while exterior neighborhood shots beyond the house's block were filmed in the Brightmoor neighborhood of Detroit. In April 2021, Logical's founder and the film's main financier, Eric Tavitian, died of cancer. Unsure of the film's future, Lee secured financial backing from New Regency who increased the budget to $4.5 million, and as a result, 20th Century Studios became the film's distributor, stemming from a prior distribution deal between Regency and The Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century's parent division.\n\n\n== Themes and interpretations ==\nBarbarian has been characterized as having themes related to sexual abuse, incest, and trauma, and, owing to the book by which Cregger was inspired, themes of different forms of misogyny. Writing for Film School Rejects, Aurora Amidon asserted that the film is essentially about \"the ripple effects of abuse\", concerning the characters of AJ and Frank—who, in the habit of harming women for their own pleasure,  are cut from the same cloth.\n\n\n== Release ==\nBarbarian was originally scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States by 20th Century Studios on August 12, 2022, before being rescheduled to be released on August 31, and later September 9. Disney reportedly maintained a theatrical release for Barbarian (as opposed to a streaming release on Hulu) due to strong, positive reception from studio test screenings.\nCinemaBlend and AMC Theatres premiered the film at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, where it garnered positive reactions. The film was also screened at the Arrow Video FrightFest on August 29. The film was released on October 20, 2022, in Australia, on October 27 in New Zealand, and on October 28 in the United Kingdom.\nIn the United States, Barbarian was released on digital download and to stream on HBO Max beginning on October 25. It was also released on Star+ in Latin America and on Disney+ as part of the Star content hub in other international territories on October 26, 2022.\nThe film was released on Disney+ as part of the Star content hub in the United Kingdom on December 14, 2022. A soundtrack album for the film featuring score by Anna Drubich was released by Hollywood Records on December 9, 2022.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe first trailer for Barbarian was released on June 23, 2022, and appeared at the front of theatrical showings of The Black Phone. According to Margules, Disney marketed the film to \"feel like a discovery\" and teasing very little of the film's plot in promotional materials.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nBarbarian grossed $40.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $4.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $45.4 million, against a production budget of $4.5 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, Barbarian was released alongside Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva and Lifemark, and made $3.9 million from 2,340 theaters on its first day, including $850,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $10 million, topping the box office; 59% of the audience was male, with 74% being between 18 and 34. The film made $6.3 million in its second weekend, finishing behind newcomer The Woman King. Deadline Hollywood called the 40% week-to-week drop \"pretty spectacular\", noting that horror films typically see a 65% decline in their sophomore frames. The film was added to 550 theaters in its third weekend and made $4.8 million, finishing fourth at the box office.\n\n\n=== Streaming viewership ===\nAccording to the streaming aggregator Reelgood, Barbarian was the fifth-most-watched program across all platforms during the week of October 26, 2022. According to Whip Media, Barbarian was the most streamed film across all platforms in the United States during the week ending October 30, and the sixth during the week ending November 13. According to the streaming aggregator JustWatch, Barbarian was the second most streamed film across all platforms in the United States during the week of October 31 to November 6, 2022.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 207 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Smart, darkly humorous and above all scary, Barbarian offers a chilling and consistently unpredictable thrill ride for horror fans.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.

        "title": "Eberechi Eze",
        "content": "Eberechi Oluchi \"Ebere\" Eze ( ə-BAIR-ə-tchee EZ-ə; born 29 June 1998) is an English professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for Premier League club Arsenal and the England national team.\nA product of numerous English academies, Eze began his senior career with Queens Park Rangers in 2016. His breakthrough came in the 2019–20 season, in which he scored 14 goals and was named the club's Player of the Year. He was subsequently signed by Crystal Palace for £17 million. He went on to make over 150 appearances for the club, as well as scoring the only goal in the 2025 FA Cup final to win the club's first ever major trophy, as well as winning the 2025 FA Community Shield, before he was signed by Arsenal for £67.5 million.\nA former England youth international, Eze made his senior debut in 2023, and later represented his country at UEFA Euro 2024.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEberechi Oluchi Eze was born on 29 June 1998 in Greenwich, Greater London, to Igbo Nigerian parents.  Growing up, he reflected on his life, saying: \"There are the nice parts [of Greenwich] and the not so nice parts. I grew up in a not so nice part. It wasn't the easiest life and you don't have as much as other kids around you. The first place we'd go after school is to the cage. We'd stay there till our parents called us in, not eating, playing all day and night. There wasn't really anything else to do. But that's where the love comes from. [At the time], you don't realise it's actually how you're learning your trade.\" Eze then met Bright Osayi-Samuel, his teammate during his time at Queens Park Rangers, at secondary school and played football together at the same district team.\nEze started his football career at Arsenal before being released when he was thirteen and then went on to join Fulham and Reading. Eze then appeared as a youth player at Millwall, where he signed a two-year scholarship with the club. Eze quickly progressed through the under-18 and reserve teams. It was announced in April 2016 that Eze would be leaving Millwall at the end of the 2015–16 season after not being offered a professional contract.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Queens Park Rangers ===\n\n\n==== 2016–2018 ====\nFollowing his release from Millwall, Eze continued studying in college before trialling successfully with Championship club Queens Park Rangers, impressing the club's technical director Chris Ramsey. Eze completed his signing for QPR on 3 August 2016. On 7 January 2017, Eze made his first-team debut in an FA Cup tie against Blackburn Rovers, featuring for 18 minutes before being injured and replaced by Yeni Ngbakoto. The game resulted in a 2–1 home defeat for QPR. This was his only appearance of the 2016–17 season for the side. He then signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2019.\nOn 30 August 2017, Eze joined League Two club Wycombe Wanderers on loan until January 2018. He made his Wycombe Wanderers debut, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute, in a 0–0 draw against Newport County on 9 September 2017. After making his debut for the club, Eze quickly became a first team regular for the side, where he rotated in different midfield positions. Eze scored his first ever senior goal on 7 October 2017, netting a brace for Wycombe against Cambridge United. His goal against Cambridge United earned him a nomination for the League Two Goal of the Month award for October. He made a total of 20 appearances and played a part in Wycombe gaining promotion that season. Eze scored a further four times in total for Wycombe, putting in some eye-catching performances before returning to QPR in January.\nAfter returning to QPR, Eze featured regularly for Ian Holloway's side, who planned on using him in the first team. His first appearance of the 2017–18 season came on 6 January 2018 against Milton Keynes Dons in the third round of the FA Cup, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute, in a 1–0 loss. By the end of the 2017–18 season, he had made 16 appearances, with his first goal for the club coming on 10 March 2018 against Sunderland, the only goal of the match.\n\n\n==== 2018–2020 ====\nAhead of the 2018–19 season, Holloway left Queens Park Rangers as the previous season was concluded and his replacement, Steve McClaren handed Eze the number 10 shirt for the club. A week later, he signed a new three-year contract with QPR, binding him to the club until June 2021. Eze started the season well when he scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–1 loss against Sheffield United on 11 August 2018. Eze then scored two consecutive goals between 15 September 2018 and 19 September 2018 against Bolton Wanderers and his former club, Millwall. \nSince the start of the 2018–19 season, he continued to be a first team regular for the side, continuing to play in different midfield positions. His performance was praised by McClaren, who said: \"Eze has great talent but he did great work off the ball in terms of helping the team defend. We're asking him to do that and it's important that he does that in terms of his development.\" Eze then set up two goals in two matches between 20 October 2018 and 23 October 2018 against Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday. A month later on 24 November 2018 against Stoke City, he set up two goals for Àngel Rangel, in a 2–2 draw. Eze's fourth goal then came on 1 January 2019, in a 2–2 draw against Aston Villa. However towards the end of the 2018–19 season, Eze soon found himself placed at the substitute bench. He played 46 games in the 2018–19 season, scoring four times in all competitions.\nIn the opening game of the 2019–20 season, Eze scored his first goal of the season, \"sauntered through a static Stoke City defence to double Queen Park Rangers' lead after the interval\", to win 2–1. Three weeks later on 24 August 2019, he scored his second goal of the season, as well as setting up the club's third goal of the game, in a 3–1 win against Wigan Athletic. Two weeks later on 11 September 2019, Eze scored his third goal of the season, as well as setting up Queen Park Rangers' third goal of the game, in a 3–2 win against Luton Town. After the match, he was named in the Team of the Week by the English Football League. Since the start of the 2019–20 season, Eze retained his first team place for the side and played in different midfield positions under the new management of Mark Warburton. He then scored four more goals by the end of 2019, including two braces against Hull City and Preston North End. After the match Warburton praised his performance, saying: \"Ebe is a tremendous talent. I want him to enjoy his football and he has got to understand how much hard work is required to maximise the talent that he has. He is a talented boy, is playing exceptionally well for us, scoring goals and I hope very much that he is playing with a smile on his face as well.\"\nEze scored his tenth goal of the season and set up two goals in a 6–1 win against Cardiff City on 1 January 2020. He continued as a first-team regular, and by the time the season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he had made 37 league appearances and scored twelve times. Eze remained an integral part of the team once the season resumed behind closed doors. Eze then scored two more goals in the last remaining two matches of the 2019–20 season, coming against Millwall and West Bromwich Albion. He scored 14 goals in 48 games across all competitions in the 2019–20 season, which saw him become one of England's most promising young attacking players. Following this, Eze won the club's Sportito Supporters' Player of the Year. He was also nominated for Championship PFA Bristol Street Motors Fans' Player of the Year for 2019–20 but lost out to Luke Ayling. On 8 September 2020, Eze was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2019–20 EFL Championship.\n\n\n=== Crystal Palace ===\n\n\n==== 2020–2023: Early seasons, Achilles injury, and resurgence ====\nEze signed for Premier League club Crystal Palace on a five-year contract on 28 August 2020 for a transfer fee reportedly around £17 million. QPR had rejected a £12 million bid from Palace earlier in the month. He was given a number 25 shirt ahead of the new season. On 12 September, he made his Palace debut, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute for Jeffrey Schlupp in a 1–0 win against Southampton in the opening game of the season. Eze scored his first goal for Palace on 7 November from a free kick in a 4–1 home league win over Leeds United.\nIn May 2021, Eze was reported to have injured his Achilles tendon in a training session and was sidelined for several months. Following the departure of Andros Townsend for Everton at the start of the 2021–22 Premier League season, he was given the number 10 shirt for Palace. He netted his only goal of the season on 30 April, levelling the match on the hour mark with a cushioned left-footed finish in a 2–1 away win against Southampton. Eze scored his first goal of the 2022–23 season on 9 October 2022, weaving through tackles on the edge of the box before finishing with a low shot, which got Palace a 2–1 win against Leeds United. He scored in his following home match on 18 October, heading in a cross by Michael Olise a minute into the second half, which levelled the game in an eventual 2–1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Eze entered a run of form following the reappointment of manager Roy Hodgson in March 2023, scoring six goals in 10 games (including braces against Southampton and AFC Bournemouth, finishing the season on double figures and as the club's top scorer of the season, having played in every game of Palace's Premier League campaign.\n\n\n==== 2023–2025: Breakthrough and FA Cup win ====\nOn 10 November 2023, Eze extended his contract with Crystal Palace until 2027. On 30 December, he scored in a 3–1 win against Brentford, helping end an eight-match winless run, and scored a brace in his next home game, a 3–2 win over Sheffield United on 30 January 2024. He scored the winner in a 1–0 victory over Liverpool on 14 April; the win was Liverpool's first Anfield defeat in 28 games, and was Palace's first away win in 10. In the final game of the season on 19 May, he scored a brace in a 5–0 thrashing of fourth-placed Aston Villa, becoming Crystal Palace's fourth-highest goalscorer in its Premier League history (after Wilfried Zaha, Christian Benteke and Luka Milivojević). Despite injury woes limiting Eze's appearances in the 2023–24 season, he set a new personal record at the club, scoring 11 goals and providing six assists in 31 matches in all competitions. His partnership with Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta brought about the resurgence of Crystal Palace in the latter stages of the 2023–24 season.\nIn the opening match of the 2024–25 season against Brentford, Eze seemed to have opened the scoring with a long-range free kick goal later described as \"brilliant\" and \"superb\", but it was controversially disallowed as referee Samuel Barrott had already blown his whistle for a perceived foul by Will Hughes; as play had stopped before the ball crossed the line, the video assistant referee was unable to intervene. Brentford scored moments later, and went on to win the game 2–1. The decision was criticised by pundits, with Jamie Redknapp describing it as a \"monumental error\" and \"a nightmare decision... I'm not sure it is a foul, he could have [blown his whistle] after,\" and Micah Richards classifying it as \"not a foul\" and \"a mistake\". Eze revealed in a post-match interview that Barrott had apologised to him for the error, stating that \"it could have changed the game, but we have to deal with it.\" Eze scored his first goal of the season, a right-footed equaliser from outside of the box, in a 1–1 draw versus Chelsea on 1 September.\nOn 26 April 2025, Eze opened the scoring for Crystal Palace with a long range effort from outside the box in a 3–0 win over Aston Villa in the semi-final of the FA Cup. The result booked Crystal Palace a spot in the 2025 FA Cup final, their third final in club history. This final occurred on 17 May, where Eze scored the winning goal of the game in the 16th minute, when he performed a first-time volley to score from Daniel Muñoz's cross in from the right, leading to Crystal Palace beating Manchester City 1–0, winning Palace's first ever major trophy.\n\n\n==== 2025: Community Shield win and departure ====\nAt the start of the 2025–26 season, Eze played every minute of the 2025 FA Community Shield against Liverpool on 10 August 2025; though he missed his penalty in the ensuing penalty shootout, Palace went on to win 3–2 for the club's, and Eze's, second trophy. He was subsequently linked heavily with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, with a deal reportedly close, and was a doubt for selection in Palace's opening game of the Premier League against Chelsea. He ended up playing against Chelsea on 17 August, having a 13th-minute free-kick disallowed by VAR due to a little-applied rule over Marc Guéhi's distance from Chelsea's free-kick wall; the 0–0 draw ended up being Eze's final match for Crystal Palace.\nEze's move to Tottenham reportedly subsequently neared completion, with Palace only holding off on his departure in the hopes of fielding him in the club's maiden European fixture, a UEFA Conference League play-off fixture against Fredrikstad on 21 August, with manager Oliver Glasner stating he \"[expected] him to be back playing for us against Fredrikstad\". However, on 20 August, it was reported that Tottenham's rivals Arsenal, following an injury to forward Kai Havertz, had hijacked the impending move and reached an agreement with Palace and Eze, with the former Hale End academy player choosing to sign for his boyhood club over Tottenham.  Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta later revealed that Eze had made a phone call to him to explore any last-minute chance Arsenal would sign him before he moved to Tottenham, which facilitated his switch.\nEze had been due to play one final match for Palace against Fredrikstad on 21 August, but later pulled out of the squad in the morning following a conversation with Glasner, who confirmed his departure in a post-match interview. On 23 August, Eze released a lengthy farewell statement on social media, calling Crystal Palace a \"family club,\" saying the love and support he received would \"live in [his] heart forever,\" and describing the club's FA Cup triumph as \"the most special day of [his] career\" that would connect him with fans \"for generations.\"\n\n\n=== Arsenal ===\nOn 23 August 2025, Eze completed a move to boyhood club Arsenal for an initial fee of £60 million plus a potential £7.5 million in add-ons, on a four-year deal with the club. The deal was officially announced shortly before Arsenal's first home game of the new season against Leeds United, which Eze was watching from the stands as he was not registered by Arsenal before the deadline of 12pm; his announcement video featured club legend Ian Wright, who had also previously signed for Arsenal from Crystal Palace aged 27. He was given the number 10 shirt, which had been left vacant since the departure of Emile Smith Rowe a year prior.\nEze made his debut for Arsenal on 31 August, coming on as a substitute in a 1–0 away defeat to Liverpool.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nBecause Eze is of Nigerian descent, he has trained with the Nigeria national team. On 5 October 2018, he was called up to the England national under-20 team, and made his debut on 11 October 2018 in a 2–1 win against Italy in the 2018–19 Under 20 Elite League. He went on to make six appearances for the under-20 side.\nIn 2019, Nigeria Football Federation president Amaju Pinnick met with Eze in an attempt to persuade him to switch his allegiance to Nigeria. Eze said that he was undecided on who to represent, but Pinnick stated: \"It appears to me that he would want to play for Nigeria, but again, there is a lot of pressure on these players who play in England\". Nigeria manager Gernot Rohr later stated in January 2021 that he contacts Eze on a weekly basis.\nOn 3 September 2019, Eze was called up to the England under-21 squad by manager Aidy Boothroyd for the upcoming 2021 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification matches against Turkey and Kosovo. He was an unused substitute on both occasions. Eze eventually made his under-21 debut on 15 November as an 81st-minute substitute for Phil Foden during a 3–0 victory over Albania in 2021 European Under-21 Championship qualification.\nIn April and November 2020, Eze said he had yet to decide on whether to play for Nigeria or England at senior international level.\nEze was selected for the group stage of the 2021 European Under-21 Championship and scored his only goal at under-21 level in their final game against Croatia.\n\n\n=== Senior ===\nIn May 2021, Eze was called up to the senior England squad for the first time, as part of Gareth Southgate's 33-man provisional squad for UEFA Euro 2020, but on the same day was injured during a training session.\nIn May 2023, Southgate again called Eze up to the England squad. He made his senior debut on 16 June, appearing as a 70th-minute substitute for James Maddison in a 4–0 UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying win against Malta. This appearance meant he could no longer represent Nigeria after this point.\nOn 3 June 2024, in a pre-UEFA Euro 2024 friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina, Eze made his first start for England, playing 63 minutes before being substituted for Jack Grealish. He was named in England's 26-man squad for the tournament on 6 June. On 20 June, he made his European Championship debut, coming on in the 69th minute of England's 1–1 draw against Denmark at Waldstadion in Frankfurt. He appeared as an 84th-minute substitute for Kobbie Mainoo in the round of 16 match against Slovakia on 30 June; in the first minute of extra time, his miscued shot went to Ivan Toney, who headed the ball towards Harry Kane for the winning goal. His third appearance of the tournament came on 6 July, when he came on in the 78th minute of England's quarter-final match against Switzerland, which England won 5–3 on penalties.\nOn 24 March 2025, Eze scored his first international goal in a 3–0 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying win over Latvia at Wembley Stadium. This made him the second Crystal Palace player to score for England, after Peter Taylor in 1976.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nEze is a Christian. He is a cousin of American comedian Ego Nwodim, a cast member on Saturday Night Live. \nEze is a keen chess player, having been taught the game by former Crystal Palace teammate Michael Olise; the two were frequently seen on Palace's social media channels playing against each other at the club's training ground. On 3 May 2025, he won PogChamps 6, an online amateur chess tournament organized by Chess.com, defeating gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik and YouTuber Sapnap along the way and earning a prize of $20,000.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of match played 31 August 2025\n\n\n=== International ===\nAs of match played 7 June 2025\n\n\n== Honours ==\nCrystal Palace\n\nFA Cup: 2024–25\nFA Community Shield: 2025\nEngland\n\nUEFA European Championship runner-up: 2024\nIndividual\n\nPFA Team of the Year: 2019–20 Championship\nQueens Park Rangers Player of the Year: 2019–20\nQueens Park Rangers Players' Player of the Year: 2019–20\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nProfile at the Crystal Palace F.C. website\nProfile at the Football Association website\nEberechi Eze – UEFA competition record (archive)",

Through their mother, the siblings have Scottish ancestry. They lived on a ranch in Missoula, Montana and moved to the Asheville suburb of Biltmore Forest, North Carolina, when Margaret was four. Margaret's parents separated when she was five years old and she split her time equally between them. For many years her parents lived just 3 miles (5 km) apart. Her family home with MacDowell is in North Carolina and they have extended family nearby.\n\nAs a teenager growing up in Asheville, Margaret and her sister were both debutantes; they made their debuts at the Bal des débutantes in Paris. Qualley left home at 14 to board at the North Carolina School of the Arts, where she studied dance. She trained as a ballet dancer, earning an apprenticeship at the American Ballet Theatre and studying at New York's Professional Children's School.\nAt the age of 16, after receiving an offer to become an apprentice with the North Carolina Dance Theater company, Qualley decided to quit dance. In order to stay in New York, she began working as a model. She says of that time, \"I wrote to my mom saying 'Look, I don't think I want to be a dancer any more so I'm going to quit ballet and stay here. I will have this and this income next week.' I laid it out in a way that she couldn't say no because I was so organised.\" The modelling agency she signed with forced her to shorten her full name, and similar to her mother, Qualley went by her middle name.

        "content": "Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy (January 23, 1998 – June 18, 2018), known professionally as XXXTentacion, was an American rapper and singer-songwriter. Though a controversial figure due to his widely publicized legal troubles, XXXTentacion gained a cult following among his young fan base during his short career with his depression- and alienation-themed music. Critics and audiences often credit him for his musical versatility, with his music exploring emo, trap, trap metal, nu metal, indie rock, lo-fi, hip-hop, R&B, and punk rock. He was considered to be a leading figure in the establishment of the emo rap and SoundCloud rap genres, which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-to-late 2010s.\nBorn in Plantation, Florida, XXXTentacion spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center and soon started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013, employing styles and techniques that were unconventional in rap music such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals, drawing inspiration from third-wave emo and grunge. In 2014, he formed the underground collective Members Only and, alongside other members of the collective, soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap music scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s. XXXTentacion gained mainstream attention with his 2016 single \"Look at Me!\". His debut studio album, 17 (2017), peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, while his second album, ? (2018), debuted atop the chart; both received triple platinum certifications by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The latter's lead single, \"Sad!\", posthumously reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and had amassed more than 1.2 billion views on YouTube and 2.1 billion streams on Spotify by February 2024, in addition to having received diamond certification by the RIAA in August 2021.\nXXXTentacion faced a variety of legal issues throughout his lifetime, most notably the controversy that arose from the battery charges that were levied against him in 2016. His history of legal issues and alleged violence has been described by some as defining his legacy, while others have criticized the media's portrayal of him, arguing that his perceived improvements in character later in life have made his legacy into a tale of the power of second chances and redemption.\nOn June 18, 2018, XXXTentacion, age 20, was murdered when he was shot near a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida. The attackers fled the scene in an SUV after stealing his Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000 in cash. Four suspects were arrested and charged with first-degree murder among other charges. In August 2022, one of the four men pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against the other three defendants in their trial. The trial initiated on February 7, 2023. On March 20, 2023, all three were found guilty on all counts. On April 6, 2023, they were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\nXXXTentacion has RIAA-certified sales of 61 million units in the US, and BPI-certified sales of over 7 million units in the UK, bringing his total to 68 million certified records sold in the two countries. Since his death, he has won an American Music Award and a BET Hip Hop Award and received 11 Billboard Music Award nominations. Two posthumous albums were released, Skins (2018) and Bad Vibes Forever (2019); the former became his second number-one album on the Billboard 200, while the latter entered the top five.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy was born on January 23, 1998, in Plantation, Florida, to Jamaican parents, Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy and Cleopatra Eretha Dreena Bernard. His father named him after the Bob Marley song \"So Jah Seh\", which interpolates Ezekiel 34. Both Onfroy's father and grandfather were Rastafarians. Onfroy was born with a ventricular septal defect, commonly known as a \"hole in the heart\". Due to his condition, he never grew taller than 5 feet 6 inches. Onfroy stated he also had Syrian, Indian, and possibly Italian ancestry in an interview on The Beat in 2017.\nDue to his mother's personal problems, Onfroy was mainly raised by his grandmother Collette Jones in Pompano Beach, Florida, and Lauderhill, Florida. When Onfroy was six years old, he allegedly tried to stab a man attempting to attack his mother and was eventually put into a youth program before living with his grandmother. A source close to the Onfroy family denied that the alleged stabbing incident occurred, and it could not be corroborated by police reports, since Onfroy was a minor. Despite this, trauma and domestic violence experts have stated that it is unlikely that the story was fabricated.\nWhen Onfroy was a child, he discovered his uncle's deceased body after the man committed suicide by hanging. Onfroy referenced his trauma from the incident in multiple songs. In 2017, Onfroy alluded that he had been sexually abused by an unnamed adult when he was a child. Other traumatic events that Onfroy witnessed as a child included someone being physically tortured and someone being raped. According to Onfroy's mother, he was routinely beaten by his father as a child; she claimed that Onfroy's father tried to hit her in front of Onfroy on several occasions. In early 2008, when Onfroy was ten, his father was jailed for nine years in Arizona on RICO charges after the Drug Enforcement Administration organized a sting operation. Onfroy's father was released from BOP custody on October 30, 2015, and deported to Jamaica in late 2016. In a 2017 interview, when asked about his relationship with his father, Onfroy sarcastically asked, \"What's a father?\"\nOnfroy's interest in music initially started after his aunt persuaded him to begin attending school choir and later church choir. He was soon kicked out of the school choir after attacking another student for touching him. Onfroy attended Margate Middle School, from which he was later expelled after a series of physical altercations. He was subsequently enrolled into Sheridan House Family Ministries by his mother for over six months. Onfroy began to listen to rap, nu metal, and hard rock during his time at Sheridan House Family Ministries, which led to him learning how to play the piano and guitar.\nOnfroy attended Piper High School until he dropped out in the tenth grade. He described himself as a \"misfit\" during that time, citing how quiet he was despite being popular and regularly involved in physical confrontations. As a child, Onfroy was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Onfroy was not the athletic type and said that he was insecure and depressed during his time in high school.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2013–2016: Career beginnings and \"Look at Me\" ===\nOnfroy's career as a music artist began in June 2013 after the release of his song \"News/Flock\". According to interviews, while in juvenile detention for gun possession charges, he met Stokeley Goulbourne, another artist known as Ski Mask the Slump God. Some sources interviewed for a 2020 biography dispute this narrative, and say that the pair met at high school. Onfroy and Goulbourne became good friends and began freestyling. Recalling his time in detention, Onfroy said that he was respectful to the officers and staff and used to protect people from other inmates, including a homosexual cellmate, whom Onfroy later attacked for allegedly staring at him while he was changing clothes. Onfroy stated that the incident was unrelated to the inmate's sexuality, that he supported gay rights and that he was not homophobic.\nIn 2013, following his release from a juvenile detention center, he and Goulbourne met up again under the belief they were going to commit a string of home invasions for monetary gain, though Onfroy eventually bought a Blue Snowball microphone and began recording music, which convinced Goulbourne to do the same. After Onfroy adopted the moniker XXXTentacion, he uploaded his first non-deleted song, called \"Vice City\", on SoundCloud, included on his debut mixtape XXX (Unmastered) released on March 5, 2014. The word \"tentación\" in his stage name is the Spanish word for \"temptation\". Speaking about his decision to abandon a life of crime for music, Onfroy said that he felt like music was a better outlet for his feelings and then-girlfriend Geneva Ayala was someone who helped him realize that.\nHe would then continue uploading small snippets of his songs that he would either soon release or keep unreleased. Onfroy eventually joined Ski Mask the Slump God's group Very Rare, before breaking off and starting the Members Only collective in 2015, which Ski Mask then also joined.\nOnfroy released his two first official extended plays (EPs), called E.motion and XXX, on April 30, 2014, alongside the original version of the song \"Ecstasy\" later remixed for Onfroy's last album Bad Vibes Forever. The Nobody's and The Fall were supposed to be part of a trilogy of EPs alongside The Underworld, inspired by The Weeknd's trilogy of mixtapes. However, The Underworld was completely abandoned when he started working on other projects. An unfinished version of The Nobody's  was released on July 11, 2014, but it was quickly removed when Onfroy decided to keep working on it before re-releasing this EP completely finished, but it never happened. The Fall was released on November 21, 2014. In 2015, Onfroy released a collaborative mixtape with Ski Mask the Slump God, Members Only Vol. 1, before releasing Members Only Vol. 2 with several members of the growing Members Only collective. On December 31, 2015, the original version of \"Look at Me\" was uploaded to the SoundCloud account of the song's co-producer, Rojas.\nOn April 28, 2016, Onfroy released the EP Willy Wonka Was a Child Murderer, with music heavily inspired by heavy metal and indie music. In 2016, Onfroy quit his job as a call center operator due to his growing music career and moved in with rapper Denzel Curry. In July 2016, Onfroy was arrested and charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. After posting $10,000 bail, Onfroy continued to work on his debut independent album, Bad Vibes Forever, which had a slated October 31, 2016, release date. The album missed the release date and was delayed due to Onfroy being arrested in early October on multiple charges of false imprisonment, witness tampering and aggravated battery of his allegedly pregnant girlfriend.\n\n\n=== 2017: Release from prison, Revenge, 17, and A Ghetto Christmas Carol ===\n\nIn 2017 \"Look at Me\" gained traction, peaked at number 34 on US Billboard Hot 100 and the top 40 of the Canadian Hot 100. The single helped him gain more popularity due to accusations of Canadian rapper Drake using a similar rap flow in his song \"KMT\". XXXTentacion's distinctive half-colored hair, which was inspired by The Hundred and One Dalmatians antagonist Cruella de Vil, also drew public attention. During his jail stint, Onfroy signed a deal to be managed by Soloman Sobande (who would remain his manager until his death) and despite Onfroy being in jail during his initial breakthrough, major-label scouts began offering six-figure contracts and Onfroy eventually signed for Empire Distribution for lower royalty rate, full creative control and a smaller upfront payment.\nAfter his release from prison on April 18, 2017, he released three more songs on SoundCloud. In an interview with WMIB, Onfroy announced that he was working on the studio albums Bad Vibes and 17; as well as a mixtape, I Need Jesus. In an interview three days after his release from prison, Onfroy said to XXL, \"I got this really, really, really good album called 17. That's more of an alternative, R&B sound—then I've got this mixtape called I Need Jesus, which is mainly rap and the underground sound I did.\"\nOnfroy announced his first nationwide tour on April 28, 2017. The tour, titled \"The Revenge Tour\", had 26 tour dates overall and generated much media coverage, included that of a rapper being assaulted, Onfroy being knocked out after an altercation on stage, an audience member being stabbed, Onfroy being thrown into a barricade by security, and an incident in which Onfroy punched a fan after the fan had placed his hand on Onfroy's chest. He announced the cancellation of the rest of the tour dates due to his cousin being shot on June 24, 2017, though the final tour date in Broward County, Florida, still went ahead and was later streamed on the watchthemusic (WAV) app.\nOnfroy was named as the tenth pick on XXL's \"2017 Freshman Class\".\nOnfroy released his debut commercial solo mixtape, Revenge, on May 16, 2017. The mixtape consists of eight previously released songs. The collaborative mixtape, Members Only, Vol. 3, with Members Only, was released on June 26, 2017.\nOnfroy's first opener for a major act happened when DRAM brought Onfroy out at a concert on August 9, 2017, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles during Kendrick Lamar's Damn Tour.\nOnfroy released his debut album, 17, on August 25, 2017. The album debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200, selling 86,000 album-equivalent units first week. The album received a mixed response from critics, some of whom lauded the album for its personal narratives and diverse musical style. On September 3, 2017, Onfroy announced that Bad Vibes Forever, his second album, was still in production.\n17 gave Onfroy's seven songs—\"Jocelyn Flores\", \"Revenge\", \"Fuck Love\", \"Everybody Dies in Their Nightmares\", \"Depression & Obsession\", \"Save Me\", and \"Carry On\"—that debuted in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 31, 77, 41, 54, 91, 94 and 95, respectively. Jocelyn Flores became Onfroy's highest-charting song since \"Look at Me\", which peaked it at 34. Onfroy then had his ninth song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, in turn with his being featured on Kodak Black's song \"Roll in Peace\", taken from Project Baby 2. The song debuted at 52 and peaked at 31, matching \"Jocelyn Flores\".\nOn September 12, 2017, Onfroy released his first official music video for his 2015 song \"Look at Me\", as well as sharing a music video with his 2015 song \"Riot\". Onfroy's label, Bad Vibes Forever, signed a distribution deal with Capitol Music Group subsidiary, Caroline, on October 19, 2017. The deal, reportedly worth $6 million, was for one album only. Shortly afterwards on October 25, 2017, Onfroy announced he was terminating his contract with Caroline despite a representative confirming he was still signed.\nTwo days later, he announced that he was retiring due to negativity and backlash though some publications noted that Onfroy made similar statements before and not followed through. On October 30, 2017, Onfroy announced that he would make music again if fellow Broward rapper and \"former best friend\", Ski Mask the Slump God, was his friend again. Later, Onfroy answered a fan's question on Instagram Live about his retirement, saying, \"Am I quitting? Yes, I'm quitting—I don't know for how long, but I'm just not going to make music right now.\"\nOn September 22, 2017, Noah Cyrus released her single titled \"Again\", featuring Onfroy's vocals.\nOnfroy previewed new music on November 2, 2017, signaling a return to making music. Onfroy announced Bad Vibes Forever again on November 17, 2017, speaking on the album, Onfroy said \"It will be a mix of genres you have seen me dabble with, if you are not a fan of me this is not an album for you, it is for core fans only\". The album title shares its name with his label. On December 11, 2017, Onfroy released his tenth EP, A Ghetto Christmas Carol on SoundCloud. A day before his hearing for witness tampering charges, Onfroy announced that he was preparing three albums to be ready for 2018, and after being released on house arrest, he announced the titles of all three albums, Skins, Bad Vibes Forever and ?.\n\n\n=== 2018: YouTube channel and ? album ===\n\nOn June 22, 2015, Onfroy began to use his long-time YouTube channel \"xxxtentacion\" (now stylized in all caps), previously used to upload music, to upload gaming videos and vlogs. The channel has 36.7 million subscribers and an estimated 9 billion total views as of April 2022. On January 22, 2018, Onfroy announced on Instagram that he and New York rapper Joey Badass had been creating a project together, and the two released a freestyle to the song \"King's Dead\" on SoundCloud on March 9, 2018, in preparation for the collaboration.\nThe \"xxxtentacion\" YouTube channel uploaded the video \"#THEHELPINGHANDCHALLENGE\" on the same day. The video included Onfroy donating musical instruments, video game consoles, and other gifts to a foster home. Shortly afterwards, Onfroy declared his album had finished and he was preparing to release it but would only do so after the hashtag #HELPINGHANDCHALLENGE reached one million mentions on Instagram.\nOnfroy released his first single of 2018 on February 2, titled \"Shining Like the Northstar\".

I'm more inspired by artists in other genres besides rap.\" XXXTentacion as an artist has been defined as versatile and his music has been described as having a \"lo-fi\" aesthetic, being diverse and experimental, drawing influence from heavy metal. His music also has the tendency to contain distorted bass and an \"intentional lack of polish\". Speaking about this, XXXTentacion said that the intentionally bad mixing on his tracks make it \"genuine\". Some fans have also noted that his music has inspired many up-and-coming artists, such as Juice Wrld and Trippie Redd, into channeling similar aesthetics into their music, with the former dedicating the song \"Legends\" to XXXTentacion following his death.\n\nXXXTentacion generally changed his vocal style depending on the type of song he was performing on. His vocal style has been described as displaying \"emotional vulnerability\" on much more depressing tracks and as replicating screaming on much more aggressive tracks. His songwriting has been described as outlandish and shocking, often referring to \"violence, sex, and drugs\", though on some projects such as The Fall and 17, Onfroy's songwriting was more emotional in comparison to his previous work, often referring to loneliness, depression, isolation, and anxiety. He was known for his \"depressing, and at times devastating\" music that brought attention to mental health.\n\n\n=== Public image and feuds ===\nOnfroy was generally considered a controversial figure within the hip-hop industry due to public feuds with other artists, legal issues, and general social media scandals. Spin labeled Onfroy \"rap's most controversial man\" and XXL labeled him as their most \"controversial freshman ever\".\nOn August 24, 2017, a day before the release of his debut album, 17, Onfroy uploaded a video to the social media platform Instagram of him depicting the act of suicide by hanging. He later uploaded a video onto Instagram showcasing the video being shot in part of a music video.\nOnfroy uploaded a music video to YouTube for his song \"Riot\" after sharing a music video for his on September 12, 2017. The controversial scene portrays him placing a noose around the neck of a caucasian child then hanging him (representing lynching). The child's mother originally was anxious about the scene but said she was fine with the message being portrayed, which XXXTentacion explained as, \"No matter how you look at it, the four murders I showed in the beginning were murders that were done by supremacists that were real. That white boy is still alive. So the people that died in the video are real. Everyone is so bothered by the child being lynched, but whether you realize it or not, the murders in the beginning are all real. Heather Heyer, Emmett Till, Philando Castile, these are real murders. This Caucasian child is still alive. It's art portrayal... It's me basically putting the shoe on the other foot, showing another perspective.\" Talking on Instagram Live, he told his followers that the video was not just supporting Black Lives Matter, but was also supporting All Lives Matter.\nOnfroy announced he was retiring from producing music on October 27, 2017. Onfroy then stated using the Instagram story feature that he would make music again if South Floridian rapper, frequent collaborator, and best friend Ski Mask the Slump God would become his friend again, telling his fans to post \"Be friends with X again\" on Ski Mask's social media accounts. The post led to a social media exchange between the two, with Onfroy explaining his side using the Instagram Live feature on Instagram:\n\nIt was a lack of appreciation on his end, not because of me, I guess just from a business perspective. But he put a business perspective before a personal relationship, and I've been with him as a friend and as a brother for a very long time. I mean, it's just on some other shit to be honest. It's not on anything I've done wrong. I can't even say I've done anything to him, and I wouldn't go on the Internet and express that if I didn't care about the relationship, but you already know how it goes. They use you to where they wanna go and then part ways. And I've been used a lot if you haven't noticed.\nSki Mask replied shortly afterward, using Instagram's story feature, \"[I'll] always love that alien-looking nigga named XXX, but I have to distance myself because it's like nobody would see me as an individual rapper if I don't, on top of that, that nigga crazy as hell\", Ski Mask then went on to post a much more intense version of the story, claiming that Onfroy threatened his family. On December 8, 2017, Onfroy wrote on Instagram, \"don't care about what you said about me, you know who got your back, love you, forever\", referring to Ski Mask the Slump God. Later, during Rolling Loud in Miami in 2018, they reunited, ending the feud.\nFollowing a rumor that Onfroy was arrested in Las Vegas, Houston rapper Ugly God tweeted \"Free X\" which prompted a strong response from Onfroy, which featured Onfroy insulting Ugly God. Ugly God later clarified there was no feud between them.\nCanadian rapper Drake previewed a new track, titled \"KMT\", on January 28, 2017. The song, following its preview, was compared by users on social media to Onfroy's breakout song \"Look at Me\" due to the use of a similar triplet-heavy flow. Before the release of KMT, HotNewHipHop revealed that Drake followed Onfroy's account on Twitter. In an interview with XXL, Onfroy was questioned about the Drake comparisons, responding \"If Drake is gonna take the flow, and I don't know if he legitimately did, but if that is the situation, at least reach out to a nigga, help a nigga out in this situation.\"\nDrake released the mixtape More Life on March 18, 2017, which included \"KMT\". Onfroy was released from jail on probation two weeks later and was subsequently interviewed by WMIB, where he called Drake a \"bitch\" and said that he respected Drake's influence but felt like \"KMT\" was disrespecting him. The following day on Twitter, Onfroy posted a picture of Drake's mother saying \"she could get it\". He then posted a picture of Drake's mother and a child version of Drake with Onfroy's face photoshopped over that of Drake's father, Dennis Graham. Later, in an interview with DJ Semtex, Drake denied those accusations that he stole Onfroy's \"flow\". Drake also denied knowing him and said that he only heard about him regarding rumors circulated following the \"KMT\" snippet. Onfroy replied on his Twitter page requesting that Drake \"come to Florida\", after Onfroy saying that he will not \"Twitter rap with niggas\".\nRapper Offset from the hip-hop group Migos used Instagram's livestream feature to verbally attack Onfroy, further escalating the feud. Chicago rapper 600Breezy then claimed that Drake gave him permission to enter into the feud and attack Onfroy. 600Breezy told Onfroy that he has \"got a couple niggas that will knock you off in your own city\". 600Breezy later went to Florida to attempt to search for him, though it was fruitless.\nOn November 14, Onfroy posted on his Instagram story accusing rap group Migos of attacking him and pointing a firearm at him due to his former issues with Drake.\nThe music streaming service Spotify announced on May 10, 2018, that it was going to stop promoting or recommending music by Onfroy, Tay-K, and R. Kelly. Spotify stated, \"We don't censor content because of an artist's or creator's behavior, but we want our editorial decisions—what we choose to program—to reflect our values\". Onfroy and his team responded criticizing the decision, pointing out that artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Dr. Dre, David Bowie, and Michael Jackson were not being censored despite more severe allegations being levied against them than the ones brought against Onfroy. The decision to remove Onfroy's music from curated playlists was later reversed after Top Dawg Entertainment CEO Anthony Tiffith threatened to remove his label's music from the service. Although Tiffith did the action, Onfroy thanked Kendrick Lamar and Top Dawg as a whole.\n\n\n==== Incidents at concerts ====\nOn March 26, 2017, following Onfroy's release from jail, he set up a surprise concert that was arranged for April 7 in Miami. The show had an admission price of $5 until it was apparently filled up. However, before he arrived, a riot broke out. Police eventually escorted Onfroy out and closed the show down.\nRapper and member of Onfroy's Members Only collective Wifisfuneral was assaulted at the first show in the Revenge Tour in Houston on May 31, 2017. Wifisfuneral stage-dived into the audience where several audience members proceeded to kick him and then leave the venue.\nDuring a concert in San Diego in June 2017, a physical altercation occurred, which led to Onfroy being knocked unconscious and an audience member being stabbed, though the injury was non-life-threatening. The assailant was reported to be an associate of rapper Rob Stone, then involved in a feud involving Onfroy and Ski Mask. The feud had already led to Ski Mask the Slump God being assaulted during rapper Desiigner's Outlet tour. Stone released a diss track following the attack, titled \"Xxxtracredit\", in which he mentions the attack in San Diego and then proceeds to tell Onfroy to \"not come back to California\". Later in an interview, Stone denied knowing who that assailant is. In October 2017, Stone confirmed that he and Onfroy had talked and resolved their feud.\nOnfroy punched an audience member during a concert at the Complex in Salt Lake City, Utah on June 16, 2017. He claimed this was in self-defense, as he had requested that no one in the audience touch him, warning that he would punch them if they did.\nOnfroy was scheduled to perform at the Concord Music Hall in Chicago, Illinois on June 20, 2017. The concert was canceled at the last minute, which led to hundreds of fans flooding the streets and nearly starting a riot. He said that the reason for the performance being canceled was the venue management's decision. Three days later, his cousin was shot and he canceled his tour.\nFollowing the release of Onfroy's 17 album, a free concert was announced to take place at the Orpheum in Tampa, Florida, on September 2, 2017. The venue only had the capacity to support 750 concertgoers, but over 3,000 people appeared to attend the concert and the venue had to cancel the concert before a safety hazard was created. This led to many fans of the artist nearly rioting in the street and the police needing to break up the crowd. Some fans later claimed online that they were teargassed by police officers following the riot.\nOnfroy was involved in another brawl with a fan during California's Rolling Loud Festival on October 21, 2017. Onfroy announced on Instagram that the fight was purely self-defense before any video of the altercation was uploaded.\n\n\n== Legal issues ==\n\n\n=== Juvenile charges ===\nIn late 2012, Onfroy was arrested for possession of 21 grams of marijuana, a felony in Florida law. He was sentenced to one month of juvenile detention and six months at a behavioral correction facility. Shortly after his release, he was arrested again for breaking into a house to steal a laptop to create music.\nIn 2014, Onfroy was sent to a youth detention center for a year on gun possession charges. According to Onfroy, during his time in detention, the district attorney was attempting to try him as an adult for gun possession, which would have had a sentence of 5–10 years in prison. Onfroy's narrative of this time in youth detention has been disputed by sources interviewed for a 2020 biography; he may have served one month's detention as part of a wider sentence of less than one year, and his charges cannot be corroborated by public files as he was a juvenile.\nIn August 2015, Onfroy attempted to commit suicide by running into incoming traffic. He was transferred to the hospital for his injuries, and was ultimately fined $86.50 for the incident.\n\n\n=== Stabbing of Tablez ===\nDylan Turner, known professionally as Tablez, a New Jersey native studying at Full Sail University, managed XXXTentacion and his best friend Ski Mask the Slump God in 2016. Due to Onfroy's inexperience in music and Tablez's inexperience in management, they agreed that Tablez would be paid only in the proceeds from the song \"Look at Me!\".\nOne night, Ski Mask and Tablez got into an argument while at Tablez's apartment, which led to Ski Mask storming out. Ski Mask later called Onfroy while drunk and lied that Tablez had taken thousands from Onfroy. According to Tablez's account, days later an angry Onfroy and others broke into Tablez's apartment and Onfroy shouted, \"What if I stab you? What if I fucking stab you?\" while poking a knife towards Tablez's stomach, stopping just a few inches short and then pulling back. Tablez said that he did not know if Onfroy meant to stab him, because Onfroy said in shock, \"Oh fuck\", after Tablez exclaimed to Onfroy that he had stabbed him. However, the blade sank into his abdomen. Tablez recounted that Onfroy and the others then stole his laptop and fled.\nTablez required emergency surgery and suffered life-changing injuries. He pledged to drop charges against Onfroy if his computer could be returned, saying that he \"didn't want one bad choice to define who [Onfroy] was.\" Tablez stuck to his word despite all its files being deleted. Onfroy paid for the entirety of Tablez's hospital bills, and later apologized to Tablez and thanked him for dropping the charges, stating to him, \"Thank you for dropping the charges. As fucked up as the situation is, I am forever in your debt.\" When asked if he thought Onfroy was genuinely changing later in life to become a better person, Tablez responded, \"Yes. Deep down we all are.\"\n\n\n=== Robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and home invasion charges ===\nOn July 14, 2016, days after being bailed for stabbing Tablez, Onfroy was arrested and charged with robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and home invasion committed in November 2015. According to the arrest report, Onfroy entered the home of Che Thomas with three other people, armed with a firearm. After pistol-whipping Thomas three times, Onfroy escaped the home with an iPad, an iPhone, a Sony PlayStation Portable, and $20.\nOnfroy was arrested in Orlando originally, but was later transferred to Orange County. His constant relocations were due to an eventually successful plan by prosecutors to find a jurisdiction that would charge him as an adult for a crime committed as a juvenile. He was released on a $10,000 bond in September 2016. Following Thomas requesting that Onfroy not receive prison time, Onfroy pleaded no contest to the charges and was ultimately sentenced to six years probation.\n\n\n=== Domestic violence and witness tampering charges ===\nAfter posting the bail of $10,000 in early October of the same year, while awaiting trial, Onfroy was arrested again later that month on charges of aggravated battery of a pregnant woman, domestic battery, and false imprisonment. On March 26, 2017, Onfroy was released from jail on a $50,000 bail while facing charges of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. His trial for the domestic violence and witness tampering charges was originally going to take place in May 2017 and was pushed back several times, and was set to take place on October 5, 2017.\nOn September 8, 2017, Pitchfork leaked the testimony of the alleged victim in Onfroy's case. The trial was then delayed again with a date of December 11, 2017, announced. Controversy arose once again following Onfroy's choice to donate $100,000 to domestic violence prevention programs, and then further when Onfroy announced an event to support rape victims though it was later canceled due to vandalism.\n\nOnfroy's trial was delayed again after an affidavit was filed by Onfroy's ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala, the alleged victim in the case, asking for the charges to be \"completely dropped\". She also declined to testify in court, making the battery charges being dropped or an acquittal of Onfroy on the charges more likely. In reaction, the prosecution moved to split the domestic violence and witness tampering case into two, with additional witness tampering charges being filed against Onfroy and a new trial date announced for December 15, 2017. Despite this, sources close to Ayala said the letter was genuine and that she wanted to move on. Ayala revealed after Onfroy's death that she was against Onfroy receiving prison time.\nOn December 10, 2017, Onfroy posted a message to Instagram, writing \"Court date is on the 15th 9:00 am here is my court information, if I am taken into custody, I want to tell everyone I've let down I apologize, I tried my best, I really did ...\"; he then released the information of the court hearing.\nOnfroy pleaded not guilty on December 14, 2017, and was taken into pretrial custody after a motion was filed by the prosecution on the grounds of Onfroy having violated his bond. He was held without bail. It was confirmed on December 20, 2017, that Onfroy was being released on house arrest. Onfroy was released from house arrest on March 21, 2018.\nOnfroy's lead attorney, J. David Bogenschutz said after Onfroy's death that he believed Onfroy would have avoided a prison sentence and would have instead been sentenced to probation if he was convicted of any of the charges, since the judge presiding over the case, Richard Hersch, had appeared to begin to look more favorably upon him, even granting him permission to go on tour. Hersch had also issued a gag order on recordings related to Onfroy's case while it was ongoing. Onfroy's domestic violence charges, which he was awaiting trial for, were voluntarily dropped by the prosecution following his death.\nIn 2019, documents and audio of phone calls that Onfroy made to his mother from jail were released, in which Onfroy claimed that his ex-girlfriend may have not been pregnant and claimed that it was his female friends who beat Ayala for getting Onfroy sent to a \"mental asylum\". Onfroy had been involuntarily hospitalized under Florida's Baker Act in 2016 after Ayala and Onfroy's roommates reported to police that he had attempted suicide.\n\n\n=== Controversy over Snapchat video, false accusation threats, and defamation lawsuit ===\nShortly after being released from house arrest, a Snapchat video surfaced of Onfroy hitting a girl, Breonna Starling, in 2013 when he was 15. Onfroy's attorneys claimed the video, which features a caption written by Starling that sardonically reads \"I hate this nigga\" along with Onfroy dancing to some music before striking the girl, was \"obviously . . . in jest\".\nOnfroy claimed afterwards that he was afraid he was going to be financially extorted by Starling and that members of her family had already called him requesting money. Starling came forward several days later saying she was \"terrified for her life\"; however, according to TMZ, Onfroy intended to sue Starling for fraud and defamation after her family demanded a large sum of money in exchange for her silence.\nAccording to the legal complaint against Starling, after the video appeared on Reddit, Onfroy's manager, Solomon Sobande, messaged Starling on Instagram, stating to her, \"Hey, this is Solomon, [Onfroy's] manager. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience.\" A few hours later, Sobande received a call from Starling. She stated to Sobande, \"I already know why you're calling. I don't know why everyone is making a big deal out of this video. We were only playing around, and that video was years ago. What the hell is wrong with people?\" Sobande asked Starling if she could release a statement stating what she had said in the call, and she immediately agreed. A few hours later, Sobande received a phone call from the same number, but Starling's grandparents were the ones on the phone. They said they were extremely upset with the video, and after Sobande had stated that she told him that the video was in jest, they denied Starling having stated that. After the call, Starling blocked Sobande on Instagram. The complaint alleged that Starling, her grandparents, and an attorney had discussed the potential of the video for them to receive great financial gain, and demanded $300,000 in exchange for Starling's silence, and additionally threatened to falsely accuse Onfroy of brandishing a BB gun prior to the video. Additionally, the complaint stated that Starling had changed her tone after learning of Onfroy's ongoing criminal domestic violence case with Ayala, threatening to hold a press conference to \"show the world how violent Onfroy is.\"\nStarling later released a statement admitting that the version of events described by Onfroy and his team were correct, and that she \"hope[d] that people see the video in the playful context in which it was recorded and nothing more\". After Starling's admission, Onfroy dropped his lawsuit against her.\n\n\n=== Leaked audio regarding domestic violence and a stabbing incident ===\nOn October 23, 2018, Pitchfork released secretly recorded audio of 18-year-old Onfroy talking with acquaintances around the time of his October 8, 2016, arrest. Pitchfork alleged that he had confessed to domestic violence in the recording and described an incident in which he stabbed eight people. The tape was considered a confession by the prosecution and defense. An extended version of the audio later released included moments after when Onfroy clarified in regards to his ex-girlfriend, \"I didn't touch her. I forgave her.\"\nOne especially fraught conversation about Onfroy's ex-girlfriend took place on the afternoon of October 26, 2016, when he told a woman, \"I already got what I wanted, I already bashed her face—her face on the internet, bruh, I done made her look bad on the internet, bruh.\" Later that day, an audio clip from the call was posted on Instagram of Onfroy saying he \"bashed her face\" without the hurried clarification.\nOn the later released full version of the recording, Onfroy is heard saying that he has \"no pride looking in the mirror\" and that he \"disgusts himself\" for not being able to control his anger. Onfroy said that he used to \"fuck [his ex-girlfriend] up\" for cheating on him, but from then on he forgave her and would not touch her again. Some have tried to claim that when Onfroy said he used to \"fuck her up\" he meant \"mentally\". Rolling Stone journalist and author Jonathan Reiss said in his biography of Onfroy that this claim is \"illogical in context.\"\nOnfroy went on in the recording to describe the trauma he had experienced, from witnessing someone's tongue being cut out, to witnessing someone being raped, and someone attempting to kill his mother. Pitchfork faced criticism for not including these details of Onfroy's trauma and remorse in their article on the recording. Jonathan Reiss said that Pitchfork \"presented [the recording] out of context and carefully chose the most damning portion that they could find.\"\nPitchfork also faced criticism for their interpretation of the stabbing incident that Onfroy described, as it was argued by some that he and his friend were about to be jumped and that he acted in self-defense. It was revealed later that Onfroy appeared to have indeed acted in self-defense, as a video of the incident showed that he and his friend, record producer Khaed were about to be jumped by around twenty-five to forty people surrounding them.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOnfroy had five half-siblings: four on his father's side, an older sister named Ariana, a younger brother named Corey, a younger brother named Givon, and a sister named Ayla; and one on his mother's side, a younger brother named Aiden. In the mid-2010s, Onfroy lived in Florida with rapper Denzel Curry and producer Ronny J. Before his death, Onfroy was moving into a 6,000-square-foot (560 m2) mansion in Parkland, which he bought, in November 2017, for US$1.4 million. At the time of his death, Onfroy lived with his girlfriend Jenesis Sanchez. The couple owned three cats and two dogs.\nOnfroy had been friends with a number of rappers and musicians, including Ski Mask the Slump God, Lil Uzi Vert, PnB Rock, Denzel Curry, Lil Yachty, Trippie Redd, Juice Wrld, and Billie Eilish. Billie Eilish claimed in an interview that Onfroy was able to talk her out of a plan to attempt suicide.\nFellow emo rapper Trippie Redd briefly ended his association with Onfroy once details of the allegations against Onfroy surfaced. After the falling out, Onfroy stated at a concert that he understood why Trippie Redd refused to associate with him, saying, \"Not that long ago I was a piece of shit. I will tell you all personally I was a piece of shit person, bro. And I can admit that, bro. I was not a good person. But I've been trying my best to change myself.\" Onfroy said that he still believed Trippie Redd was an \"amazing artist\" and proceeded to perform their song, \"Fuck Love\". Trippie Redd accepted his apology and responded on Instagram, \"It takes a real man to speak on shit and really apologize for their actions... I also apologize for anything I've said about you.\"\nIn February 2018, Onfroy posted on Instagram that he was preparing to return to school. In March 2018, he announced that he was getting his GED, which he completed according to his death certificate, and going to community college. Onfroy was public about his struggle with depression.\n\n\n=== Relationships ===\nOnfroy met Geneva Ayala in November 2014. The two began communicating when Onfroy messaged Ayala saying that he wanted to fight her boyfriend after her boyfriend had allegedly posted scantily clad photos of her without her consent, though a fight never occurred. Ayala's at-the-time boyfriend alleged that she had punched and slapped him during breakdowns she had, though he admitted he had slapped her back occasionally to \"snap her out of it\". Ayala was evicted from her mother's house when she was 16 and she had been living with her at-the-time boyfriend until they split. In 2016, Ayala moved in with Onfroy and his roommates.\nAyala had accused Onfroy of domestic abuse. According to Ayala's statement, Onfroy beat her at times, choked her, broke clothes hangers on her legs, threatened to chop off her hair or cut out her tongue, pressed knives or scissors to her face, and held her head underwater in their bathroom while promising to drown her. Ayala stated, \"His favorite thing was to just backhand my mouth. That always left welts inside my lips.\"\nThe first incident of domestic violence allegedly occurred when Onfroy slapped Ayala and broke her iPhone 6S, because she had complimented a male friend on his new jewelry. Onfroy later repaired the phone. In one incident recounted to a prosecutor, Ayala said Onfroy asked her which object she wanted him to force into her vagina: a long-handled barbecue fork, or a wire barbecue brush, she chose the fork and Onfroy told her to undress. She claimed Onfroy was lightly dragging the tool against her inner thigh when she was asleep; he did not penetrate her with it. Ayala stated that once she woke up, Onfroy started apologizing to her profusely for the incident. Following the alleged incidents, Ayala started a GoFundMe page, claiming she needed surgery for damage to her left eye. She raised over $32,000, including $5,000 being donated by Onfroy. The fundraiser was temporarily suspended by GoFundMe due to allegations of fraud. It was never confirmed whether Ayala had the surgery done.\nAyala said that Onfroy would often guilt her with near-attempts at suicide. Ayala said he used to fill a bathtub with water then fetch the microwave and dangle it over, threatening to let go. Another time he allegedly dangled himself from a 12th-story balcony by his legs and threatened suicide again after learning that Ayala had cheated on him during his time in jail. A witness to the incident stated that Ayala began to \"box\" Onfroy's face after the incident, to which Ayala admitted, but said that it was the only time she hit Onfroy. After Onfroy's death, Ayala said in regards to those discussing her accusations against Onfroy, \"It's disgusting that people are speaking for me.\" Responding to those who criticized her for mourning Onfroy after his death, Ayala said on her Instagram story, \"Did y'all know him? No, y'all did not. I knew who the fuck he was… I still fucking love him. I lost someone very dear to me and I can grieve whenever the fuck I fucking want to.\" Onfroy maintained his innocence publicly until his death.\nRoommates of both Onfroy and Ayala describe Onfroy's remorse after the alleged incidents, and say that Onfroy said he \"badly wanted to control his anger\". This included an occasion where Onfroy was described as falling to his knees and weeping, begging to himself for his behavior to change. Some psychologists have speculated that Onfroy may have suffered from an attachment disorder stemming from the absence of his mother and father during childhood, which could have made him prone to uncontrollable violent outbursts. Onfroy was re-diagnosed with bipolar disorder as an adult after initially being diagnosed as a child. Onfroy had been seeing a therapist and began taking medication by the time of his death.\nOn December 31, 2017, Onfroy entered a relationship with Jenesis Sanchez, which eventually became a domestic partnership. Sanchez said that in their relationship Onfroy showed changes in controlling his anger and would simply leave if an argument ensued, rather than ever being physical. Onfroy began saying that he saw his deceased friend, Jocelyn Flores as his \"guardian angel\" and that it helped him to make better decisions in his relationship. Three days after his death, Onfroy's mother announced on Instagram that Sanchez was pregnant with his child. In an interview, Sanchez said Onfroy was notified three weeks before he died. The baby was confirmed to be a boy on August 22, 2018, and was born on January 26, 2019, three days after what would have been his father's 21st birthday.\nA couple of weeks after Sanchez requested Onfroy's DNA samples to prove the paternity of her son, Onfroy's mother filed to block the test. Onfroy's mother sealed her court filings in opposition, so it is unclear why she objects to a paternity test. Some fans suspect it has something to do with her financial stake in Onfroy's estate. On May 15, 2019, Sanchez won the legal battle and a Florida judge granted access to a DNA sample from Onfroy.\n\n\n=== Religious and spiritual beliefs ===\nOnfroy, who was raised a Christian, had a well-documented interest in the occult. Miami New Times journalist Tarpley Hitt, who conducted one of few mainstream media interviews with him, reflected that he spent most of the two-hour conversation speaking on the subject at the expense of answering questions on his childhood or criminal charges. Housemates from his time living with the pornographic actor Bruno Dickemz recalled that he had a collection of books on occult and took part in rituals. While living there, his former partner Geneva Ayala pretended to be demonically possessed as a way to scare him out of their turbulent relationship, but it instead fascinated him. He was inspired by Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy philosophy and its teachings about consciousness.\nOn his XXL Freshman cypher and his track \"I Spoke to the Devil in Miami, He Said Everything Would Be Fine\", Onfroy mentioned selling his soul to Satan; when questioned by DJ Akademiks on the subject, he refused to answer, concerned that he could encourage \"kids going down that dark path\". Additionally, on his track \"Daemons\", Onfroy discusses a revenge fantasy against Jesus and God for allowing atrocities in the world, while expressing skepticism about the existence of God. Specifically, Onfroy describes seeking revenge upon God for allowing his uncle's mental suffering. Onfroy's uncle died from suicide by hanging when Onfroy was a child.\nOnfroy believed in reincarnation, picturing the cycle of death and rebirth as ending when one lives a life without harming others; he believed he had failed in this due to his violence. He was fascinated by the New Age concept of Indigo children, which may have been the reason for his attraction toward the color blue in the final months before his death.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nOnfroy was public about his political and personal beliefs throughout his career. In 2016, Onfroy opposed the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump and had instead signaled support for Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. He also took to Twitter predicting a Trump victory, saying, \"As much as I hate that piece of shit Donald Trump, y'all know this motherfucker's gonna win right?\" He also stated that, although he did not hold a positive opinion of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, describing her as \"garbage\", he did not want Trump to win because, \"Once Trump gets in it's over for all the minorities pretty much... the lower classes are gonna be fucked.\" His songs \"Hate Will Never Win\" and \"Suicide Pit\" contain anti-Trump lyrics.\nOnfroy said he believed that, \"If weed was legal everywhere, the world would be a better place\", and voiced support for criminal justice reform movements, stating that \"the judicial system is slavery.\" Onfroy was anti-war and spoke out against President Trump's decision to launch a missile strike on Syria in April 2017.\nDespite previously expressing opposition to gun control measures, Onfroy reversed his stance on the issue following the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. Onfroy held multiple charity events for the March for Our Lives movement and visited Parkland survivor Anthony Borges in the hospital while Borges was recovering from gunshot wounds.\nOnfroy was characterized by much of the media as homophobic following a widely seen interview he gave to Adam22 in April 2016. Onfroy told Adam22 that, one time when he was in a juvenile detention facility, he attacked his gay cellmate for staring at him while naked. Onfroy explained, \"I was gonna kill him type shit because of what he did\", but was ultimately restrained. After Onfroy's death, Liz Lazzara's article for CNN described him as homophobic, and similar characterizations were made on social media. However, friends and collaborators said he was not homophobic. In the same interview, Onfroy stated in clarification, \"I am not homophobic\", and expressed his support for the legalization of gay marriage. In a 2017 interview with The Fader which was released in November 2022, Onfroy mentioned that he should have been clearer in the podcast in which he described the fight, stating he wished he had clarified that he did not attack his cellmate for the fact that he was gay, calling his discussion of the topic \"negligent and stupid\", but stated, \"Everybody needs to realize at the time I was still a kid.\" Regarding his political beliefs, Onfroy was praised as \"incredibly progressive\" by transgender music producer Fifty Grand. Multiple transgender artists said in a 2020 biography that Onfroy was supportive of the transgender community.\nOnfroy said many times that he distrusted police due to both personal experiences and publicized instances such as the killing of Philando Castile, which Onfroy described as a murder. In the music video for \"Riot\", depictions of the killings of Emmett Till, Heather Heyer, and Philando Castile are shown, in addition to the fictional depiction at the end of the video of a white child being lynched. Onfroy said that the last depiction wasn't an expression of reverse racism, but was to show that public outrage from the video would be more so focused on the fictional white child's death rather than the depictions of actual racist killings. Onfroy expressed frustration in a 2017 interview that the officer who killed Eric Garner was not arrested.\nDuring the Revenge concert tour, Onfroy had publicly declared his support for civil rights and gay rights, and denounced racist and homophobic rhetoric from hate groups such as the KKK, saying, \"I don't give a fuck if you're black, white, yellow, purple—I don't give a fuck if you're gay, I don't give a fuck if you're straight, I give a fuck if you're a person... I stand for equality for all people.\"\n\n\n== Murder and trial ==\n\nAt 3:56 p.m EDT on June 18, 2018, Onfroy, upon leaving Riva Motorsports Motorcycle & Marine Superstore in Deerfield Beach, Florida, was blocked from exiting the parking lot by a black Dodge Journey SUV in a premeditated attack. Two armed men exited the SUV and approached the rapper while he was sitting in the driver's seat. A brief struggle occurred and the armed men reached inside Onfroy's vehicle, stole a small Louis Vuitton bag containing US$50,000 and shot Onfroy multiple times. The shooters fled the scene in their SUV. Onfroy was taken by paramedics to the nearby Broward Health North hospital in Deerfield Beach, where he was pronounced dead.\nOnfroy's death was announced by the Broward County Sheriff's Office at 5:30 pm. Dedrick Devonshay Williams of Pompano Beach was arrested two days after the shooting and held in the Broward County jail. He was charged with dangerous and depraved murder, which was later upgraded to premeditated murder. In the weeks following the event, triggerman Michael Boatwright and accomplice Robert Allen were arrested and charged with premeditated first-degree murder for their involvement. The third accomplice, Trayvon Newsome, was arrested and charged with premeditated first-degree murder in August 2018. On August 12, 2022, Allen pleaded guilty to the lesser conviction of second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against the other three defendants. Their trial initiated on February 7, 2023. All three remaining perpetrators were found guilty on all counts. Williams and Newsome were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, and Boatwright received two consecutive life sentences without parole, plus an additional consecutive 30 years. Allen was sentenced to seven years in prison with credit for time served, with a consecutive 20-year probation sentence. On October 26, 2023, Allen was released from prison and is currently on probation.\nIn his will, Onfroy named his mother Cleopatra, his half brother Aiden, and his half brother Corey as the sole beneficiaries of his estate. Onfroy's future child was not named in the will, as it was written before the pregnancy.\n\n\n=== Funeral ===\nAn open casket service for Onfroy took place at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida, on June 27, 2018, where fans were allowed to pay their respects. His private funeral took place on June 28, 2018, where rappers Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Yachty and singer Erykah Badu were among the attendees. He was entombed in a mausoleum at Gardens of Boca Raton Memorial Park, Boca Raton, Florida.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nXXXTentacion's music was driven on themes revolving around depression and alienation, becoming known for his \"depressing, and at times devastating\" music that brought attention to mental health. He employed styles and techniques that were unconventional in hip-hop during his career, such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals drawing inspiration from third-wave emo.\nChristopher Weingarten of Rolling Stone opined that XXXTentacion's success as \"a zeitgeist-grabbing, industry-defying, boundary-destroying phenomenon\" is \"overshadowed\" by his alleged violence towards his ex-girlfriend, but contended that despite media attempts to suppress him, XXXTentacion's \"impact on music will be felt for years to come\" and his recordings have \"helped signal a new era of post-streaming, post-genre teenagers\". XXXTentacion left behind what Rolling Stone called \"a huge musical footprint\" due to his impact on his young fan base and his popularity during his career. Given his immense influence only to die young, the article compared his cultural impact with that of Ritchie Valens and Darby Crash. Chris Willman of Variety described in a 2022 article that while XXXTentacion was a flawed individual, during his career he \"nearly became rap's own Kurt Cobain\", and mentioned that it was \"heartbreaking\" to see XXXTentacion killed just as he began to show signs of \"warmth, self-awareness and a desire to help\".\n\nHighlighting his ambivalent public reception during his short career, Billboard wrote:\"The provocative and polarizing artist seemed to thrive on controversy as much as art, often blurring the lines between shocking reality and button-pushing creativity. XXX's short career was characterized by both in equal measure-making the Florida rapper a martyr to a legion of fans and a cautionary tale to so many others.\"On June 18, 2019, exactly one year on from XXXTentacion's death, an official documentary on his life was announced; it featured footage of Onfroy from around April 2017 telling biographical details. On February 2, 2022, it was announced that the film, titled Look at Me, would be released on the Hulu streaming service on May 26, 2022.\nXXXTentacion has RIAA-certified sales of 38 million units in the US and BPI-certified sales of over 7 million units in the UK. He is also one of the Top-20 all-time best selling artists in terms of digital singles, with a total of 49 million RIAA-certified digital sales as of October 2020. In August 2021, XXXTentacion's single, \"Sad!\", was certified Diamond in the US.\n\nXXXTentacion has been cited as an influence by a number of artists, including Billie Eilish, Juice Wrld, Kendrick Lamar, Lil Nas X, Trippie Redd, and Kanye West.\nAs of February 2024, XXXTentacion's last Instagram post before his death holds the record of the 11th most-liked Instagram post of all-time with 32.5 million likes.\nAccording to YouGov polling as of July 2023, a majority of Americans have heard of XXXTentacion. A plurality of Americans view him positively, with 56 percent of Americans who have heard of him holding a positive opinion, and 19 percent holding a negative opinion. 52 percent of respondents said they have heard of XXXTentacion. He is most famous and popular among Millennials and Generation Z, with 75 percent having heard of him and 65 percent of those holding a positive opinion. He is known by 43 percent of Generation X and 24 percent of Baby Boomers.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nXXXTentacion's personal life and history are noted as prominent parts of his legacy. An article in The Guardian described his legacy in more critical terms, stating that \"He will be remembered mostly for the unusually cruel violence he committed on vulnerable people, particularly his ex-girlfriend, crimes for which he never expressed remorse.\" Mutual friends of both XXXTentacion and his ex-girlfriend dispute this narrative, recalling times when he had broken down in remorse. According to the article, his music \"reflected a life lived with disregard for humanity, both other people's and his own\" and rarely attempted to engage in bravado or bragging, instead focusing on \"mental illness, suicide, extreme misogyny, and a prevailing feeling of numbness\", though acknowledging that XXXTentacion \"made some attempts to rehabilitate his image.\"\nIn an article for The Atlantic, Hannah Giorgis expressed similar criticisms, though she also noted that XXXTentacion \"reminded young fans in particular that their hurt was valid but that it did not form the sum total of their lives\" and that he \"gave voice to their insecurities.\" Contrasting these elements of his legacy, Giorgis acknowledged that though XXXTentacion spent his career encouraging young fans to recognize their greater worth, she believed his legacy is nonetheless characterized by the trauma he both experienced and caused.\nIn The Washington Post, Chris Richards commented on XXXTentacion's complicated legacy, contrasting how he \"encouraged his fans to find hope in the fog of their despair, but bragged enthusiastically about the joy he felt in brutalizing others.\" According to Richards, XXXTentacion's music \"brought solace to the depressed\" while validating the sort of violence he practiced, and legitimized the pain of his fans while erasing the suffering of domestic violence victims. XXXTentacion's music serves as an example for Richards of how \"a hateful song\" might normalize such feelings in \"hateful people\", which contributes to the profound paranoia in society about the hatred that might be in the minds of others.\nIn an article for Vibe, while acknowledging XXXTentacion's controversial history, Shenequa Golding criticized those celebrating his murder. Golding commented in response to these reactions, \"Jahseh was 20 years old, which means five years ago, he was 15, and 10 years ago, he was 10. His death has required that we be the bigger person and acknowledge and respect that his life was taken, even though he didn't offer the same courtesy through his music and actions... if this 20-year-old was killed, and some of us find joy in that, how much have we exfoliated away at our own empathy and humanity? How raw have we become?\" Golding stated that although she would not condone XXXTentacion's past actions, \"he should at least earn your silence, because being delighted and vocal about his untimely death, despite his horrid past, is just wrong.\"\nIn an article for Slate, Jack Hamilton shared similar sentiments to Golding, warning of the slippery slope of moral absolutism in the wake of XXXTentacion's death, calling those celebrating his murder \"self-righteous\" and stating, \"I have trouble mining any feelings of superiority or 'justice' from the killing of a 20-year-old, no matter what he did in his life.\" Hamilton added that he disagreed with the notion that XXXTentacion was irredeemable, \"but now he'll never have a chance.\" Hamilton also cautioned against demonizing XXXTentacion's fans, writing, \"Those people just lost an artist who was important to them, who spoke to and for them when no one else seemed to, who just died in an act of brutal violence, and almost all of us of at any age know what that's like.\"\nJordan Bassett of NME additionally shared a similar point of view to that of Golding and Hamilton, writing, \"[XXXTentacion] was exposed to unspeakable violence in his past; we know patterns of abuse repeat themselves. This of course is not an attempt to excuse the things he did, but it does suggest they were the actions of a damaged child, rather than the twisted bogeyman he was depicted as on social media.\" In an interview with NME, rapper and singer Juice Wrld gave a defense of XXXTentacion, commenting, \"Everybody has their mistakes. A mistake is a mistake. Some are more severe than others, but we're no one to judge the severity of someone's mistake. As long as we doin' wrong, as long as we sinnin', you can't judge nobody else's mistakes.\"\nRolling Stone journalist and author Jonathan Reiss, who authored a 2020 biography of XXXTentacion, criticized the media's portrayal of XXXTentacion, saying, \"They bundled his sins into listicles and timelines, partaking in an almost gluttonous level of hatred. They made a monster and sold it.\" Reiss also wrote, \"One of the saddest outcomes of losing X so young is that he never got to take responsibility for his actions, but given all he did in that last year and how far he'd come, it's not far-fetched to imagine that he may have.\" Reiss commented on XXXTentacion's legacy in more favorable terms, writing, \"If being a fan of XXXTentacion or Jahseh Onfroy could mean being a believer in second chances and the power of redemption… that would be a hell of a powerful legacy.\"\nXXXTentacion's ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala, who had accused him of domestic abuse in 2016, said of the controversy surrounding her and Onfroy's past, \"It's disgusting that people are speaking for me. I don't care if no one cared about me however many months ago, I didn't lose my life. He did. It's permanent. I'm still here. Like, how do you think that makes me feel? Everyone expecting me to be relieved or happy? No, I'm broken.\" Following XXXTentacion's death, Ayala appeared in the music video and the cover art for the 2019 single \"Hearteater\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\n\n17 (2017)\n?

        "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones",
        "content": "Catherine Zeta-Jones (; born 25 September 1969) is a Welsh actress. Recognised for her versatility, she has received various accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Tony Award. In 2010, she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for her film and humanitarian work.\nBorn and raised in Swansea, Zeta-Jones aspired to be an actress from a young age. As a child, she played roles in the West End productions of the musicals Annie and Bugsy Malone. She studied musical theatre at the Arts Educational Schools, London, and made her stage breakthrough with a leading role in a 1987 production of 42nd Street. Her screen debut came in the unsuccessful French-Italian film 1001 Nights (1990), and went on to find greater success as a regular in the British television series The Darling Buds of May (1991–1993). Dismayed at being typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles. She established herself in Hollywood with roles that highlighted her sex appeal, such as in the action film The Mask of Zorro (1998) and the heist film Entrapment (1999).\nZeta-Jones received critical acclaim for her performances as a vengeful pregnant woman in Traffic (2000) and Velma Kelly in the musical Chicago (2002), winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the latter. She starred in high-profile films for much of the decade, including the black comedy Intolerable Cruelty (2003), the heist film Ocean's Twelve (2004), the comedy The Terminal (2004), and the romantic comedy No Reservations (2007). Parts in smaller-scale features were followed by a decrease in workload, during which she returned to the stage and played an aging actress in a Broadway production of A Little Night Music (2009), winning a Tony Award. Zeta-Jones worked intermittently in the subsequent decades, starring in the films Side Effects (2013), Red 2 (2013), and Dad's Army (2016). She took on supporting roles in television, portraying Olivia de Havilland in Feud: Bette & Joan (2017) and Morticia Addams in Wednesday (2022–present).\nAside from acting, Zeta-Jones is a brand endorser and supports various charitable causes. Her struggle with depression and bipolar II disorder has been well documented by the media. She is married to actor Michael Douglas, with whom she has two children.\n\n\n== Early life and initial stage career ==\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones was born on 25 September 1969 in Swansea, South Wales, to David Jones, the owner of a sweet factory, and his wife Patricia (née Fair), a seamstress. Her father is Welsh and her mother is of Irish Catholic descent. She was named after her grandmothers, Zeta Jones (derived from the name of a ship that her great-grandfather sailed on) and Catherine Fair. She has an older brother, David, and a younger brother, Lyndon, who worked as a sales representative before venturing into film production. She was born and raised in Treboeth area of Swansea before moving to the Mumbles of the city after her parents bingo win of £100,000. Because Zeta-Jones was a hyperactive child, her mother sent her to the Hazel Johnson School of Dance when she was four years old. She was educated at Dumbarton House School, a private school in Swansea. The family came from a modest background, but their fortunes improved with their bingo win, thus enabling them to pay for their daughter's dance and ballet lessons.\nZeta-Jones participated in school stage shows from a young age and gained local media attention when her rendition of a Shirley Bassey song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre. At age nine, Zeta-Jones was selected to play July, one of the orphan girls in the original West End production of the musical Annie, and in her early teens, she became a national tap dancing champion. In 1981, she played the lead role of Annie in a Swansea production of the musical, which was staged at the Swansea Grand Theatre. Two years later, she played the lead role of Tallulah in a West End production of Bugsy Malone. When she was fifteen, Zeta-Jones left school without obtaining O-levels and decided to live in London to pursue a full-time acting career; she was also engaged to perform in a touring production of The Pajama Game. Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, \"I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. It might take me two tries, but I always got the job. I figured out what they wanted\". She went on to attend the independent Arts Educational Schools in the Chiswick district of London, for a three-year course in musical theatre.\nIn 1987, a seventeen-year-old Zeta-Jones was picked as the second understudy for the lead actress in a West End production of 42nd Street. During one of the performances, both the star and the first understudy were unavailable, and Zeta-Jones was asked to play the role of Peggy Sawyer—a chorus girl who becomes a star. The producer was impressed by her acting ability and allowed her to play the part for the following two years. Her next stage appearance was with the English National Opera at the London Coliseum in 1989 where she played Mae Jones in Kurt Weill's Street Scene.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1990–1996: Screen debut and career struggles ===\nIn 1990, Zeta-Jones made her film debut in the director Philippe de Broca's film 1001 Nights. An adaptation of the Arabic fable One Thousand and One Nights, the French-Italian production recounts the tale from the perspective of Scheherazade (Zeta-Jones), one of the brides of King Sharir (Thierry Lhermitte). 1001 Nights did not perform well at the box office, and according to de Broca's obituary in The Daily Telegraph, the film \"is best remembered for its enjoyable nude scenes.\" Greater success followed when she starred opposite David Jason and Pam Ferris in the ITV period comedy-drama television series The Darling Buds of May from 1991 to 1993. Adapted from H. E. Bates' novel of the same name, Zeta-Jones played the role of the eldest daughter of a family living in the countryside in 1950s Britain. The series was the highest-rated television show in the country at the time, and Zeta-Jones gained wide public recognition for it. \"Literally, with one hour of television my life completely changed. I couldn't go anywhere\", she remarked.\nFollowing a brief appearance as Beatriz Enríquez de Arana in the unsuccessful adventure film Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992), Zeta-Jones featured as a belly dancer in disguise in a 1992 episode of George Lucas' television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. She next took on the part of an aspiring duchess in Splitting Heirs (1993), a farcical period drama from the director Robert Young about two children (Eric Idle and Rick Moranis) who are separated at birth. Reviews of the film were negative, though the critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times found her to be \"very funny\". In 1994, Zeta-Jones played the melancholic Eustacia Vye in the television film The Return of the Native, an adaptation of the 1878 novel of the same name by Thomas Hardy, and the wife of Lloyd Owen's character in the television war drama The Cinder Path. She was then cast as the eponymous protagonist of the 1995 television biopic Catherine the Great. In a mixed review, critic Lisa Nesselson of Variety found the miniseries to be \"brightly colored\" but \"wooden and hollow\", though thought that Zeta-Jones \"imparts a certain grace and resolve to her sovereign-in-the-making\". She next appeared as the pragmatic girlfriend of Sean Pertwee's character in Blue Juice (1995), publicised as Britain's first surf film, which the critic Leonard Maltin dismissed as a \"superficial and predictable\" production.\nDismayed at being typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles, stating: \"There was all this fuss about who I was and wasn't dating. I was a pretty face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again.\" She believed that her anonymity in America helped her obtain roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the henchwoman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries Titanic (1996) was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C. Scott, she played the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother who engages in an extramarital affair aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic.\n\n\n=== 1998–2000: Hollywood breakthrough and success ===\n\nSteven Spielberg took notice of Zeta-Jones in Titanic and recommended her to Martin Campbell, who was directing The Mask of Zorro (1998) for Spielberg's production company. Campbell cast her as the leading lady instead of Izabella Scorupco, who was his original choice for the part. Co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas, the film tells the story of Zorro (Hopkins), a Spanish warrior (the film is set in Old California) who sets out to avenge the death of his wife and find his lost daughter Elena (Zeta-Jones). She found similarities between her \"volatile\" Celtic personality and her Latin character's temperament, and in preparation she learnt dancing, riding and sword-fighting, and took diction lessons in Spanish. Filming action and dance sequences while wearing heavy corsets in the dry Mexican desert proved challenging for Zeta-Jones, but she found the experience \"worth suffering for\". The Mask of Zorro was positively received by the critics and grossed over $250 million worldwide. The role proved to be a breakthrough for her and she was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance.\nZeta-Jones's first release of 1999 was the heist film Entrapment, in which she starred opposite Sean Connery as a seductive insurance agent on the lookout for an art thief. Despite a negative critical reception, the film was a commercial success; Janet Maslin of The New York Times thought the film provided Zeta-Jones a platform to \"show off her slithery skills\", and Desson Howe of The Washington Post called on viewers to appreciate the sex appeal she brought to the role. Later that year, Zeta-Jones appeared alongside Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor in The Haunting, a remake of the 1963 film of the same name about a team of paranormal experts who look into strange occurrences in an ill-fated mansion. The horror feature received generally poor reviews but found a significant worldwide audience. In a scathing review, the critic Mick LaSalle wrote that \"Zeta-Jones seems less an actress and more a pretty face, and not an interesting one at that\".\nAfter taking the supporting part of the lead John Cusack's former romantic interest in the comedy-drama High Fidelity (2000), Zeta-Jones starred in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic (2000). In the ensemble thriller on drug abuse co-starring Michael Douglas and Benicio del Toro, she played Helena, the pregnant wife of a drug lord who takes over the business when her husband is arrested. Originally written as a mother of two, Soderbergh changed the part to that of a pregnant woman on Zeta-Jones's suggestion to accommodate her own pregnancy. Highly profitable at the box office and critically acclaimed, Traffic was described by the Dallas Observer as \"a remarkable achievement in filmmaking, a beautiful and brutal work\". Edward Guthman of the San Francisco Chronicle considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout among the cast and labelled her \"sensational\" in a scene in which Helena confronts a Tijuana dealer, adding that \"through sheer conviction, she electrifies a moment that could have been absurd\". The ensemble of Traffic won the SAG Award for Outstanding Cast and Zeta-Jones was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n\n=== 2001–2004: Established actress ===\nThe romantic comedy America's Sweethearts was Zeta-Jones's sole film release of 2001. She starred as a shrewd film star, opposite Julia Roberts who featured as her character's under-confident sibling. The critic Roger Ebert compared the film unfavourably to the musical Singin' in the Rain (1952), but thought that Zeta-Jones was aptly \"chilly and manipulative\" in her part. The following year, she starred as the murderous nightclub singer Velma Kelly in Chicago (2002), a film adaptation of the stage musical of the same name from director Rob Marshall. She based her character's look and mannerisms on the actress Louise Brooks, and as the script did not provide a backstory to Kelly, she worked to convey the character's \"flamboyance\" and \"desperation\" through \"little looks and nuances\". The film and her performance received critical acclaim. William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed that Zeta-Jones had made \"a wonderfully statuesque and bitchy saloon goddess\", and David Edelstein of Slate wrote that she has \"a smoldering confidence that takes your mind off her not-always-fluid dancing – although she's a perfectly fine hoofer, with majestic limbs and a commanding cleavage\" and particularly praised her rendition of the song \"All That Jazz\". Chicago grossed $306 million worldwide, and was the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Picture. For her performance, she won the Academy Award, SAG Award, and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, among other awards and nominations.\n\nFollowing the success of Chicago, Zeta-Jones voiced the part of Princess Marina in Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt as the voice of Sinbad the Sailor. She was drawn to the project to give her young children an opportunity to \"hear [her] and get a sense of [her] on film\", but the film proved to be a box office bomb. Also in 2003, Zeta-Jones starred alongside George Clooney in the Coen brothers' black comedy Intolerable Cruelty. A commercial success, the film saw her play the role of a serial divorcée who is drawn towards a divorce lawyer (Clooney). Writing for Empire, the critic Damon Wise labelled the film a \"dazzling screwball comedy\" and felt that Zeta-Jones had shown \"an admirable facility for old-school quickfire patter\". Other reviewers praised her onscreen chemistry with Clooney.\nIn 2004, Spielberg approached her to play an insecure air hostess in his comedy The Terminal, a film about a man (Tom Hanks) who is trapped at the JFK International Airport when he is denied entry into the United States. Spielberg was intent on her playing against type as a strong-willed woman, with a vulnerability in her character, but the critic A. O. Scott felt that it came across as using her for \"her looks rather than for the arch, self-mocking wit that is her secret weapon as a comic actress\". Commercially, The Terminal performed well. She next worked with Soderbergh to film Ocean's Twelve, a sequel to his heist film Ocean's Eleven (2001), which also reunited her with stars Clooney, Pitt, and Roberts. The production, which was filmed in several European countries, saw Zeta-Jones play Isabel Lahiri, a Europol agent, and the love interest of Pitt's character. Paul Clinton of CNN noted that her sex appeal benefited the film. Conversely, Ken Tucker of New York magazine argued that her character was redundant to the film's plot. Despite dividing critics, the sequel grossed over $360 million globally.\n\n\n=== 2005–2010: Decrease in workload and return to the stage ===\nThe Legend of Zorro (2005), a sequel to The Mask of Zorro, saw her reprise the role of Eléna opposite Banderas. Set ten years after the first film, the sequel follows Eléna struggling with married life. Unlike the original, the film was disliked by critics and was a commercial disappointment. She did not have any film releases in 2006. A biopic of Harry Houdini, titled Death Defying Acts (2007), starring Guy Pearce as the escapologist Houdini, featured Zeta-Jones as a Scottish con artist who claims psychic powers. The unsuccessful production was given only a limited theatrical release.\nIn 2007, Zeta-Jones starred alongside Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin in the romantic comedy No Reservations, a remake of the German film Mostly Martha (2001). No Reservations tells the story of an ambitious chef (Zeta-Jones) whose life changes for the better when she takes in her young niece (Breslin) after her sister's death. In preparation for her part, Zeta-Jones worked in the kitchen and waited on tables at New York's Fiamma Osteria restaurant. Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that Zeta-Jones \"shines as a character that finely balances off-putting reserve with sympathetic appeal\", and Roger Ebert, despite disliking the film, did find her to be \"convincing\" in her role. With a global gross of $92 million, the film marked her final commercial success of the decade.\n\nAfter No Reservations, Zeta-Jones significantly decreased her workload in the following five years. She instead chose to focus on her family and health, having been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, and her infrequent acting appearances were in smaller-scale and less successful productions. She took on the role of a forty-year-old mother attracted to a younger man (Justin Bartha) in the romantic comedy The Rebound. The production was released theatrically in markets outside of the United States in 2009–10, but due to financial troubles of its distributor, The Film Development, the film failed to release theatrically in America.\nZeta-Jones returned to the stage in 2009 with a revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical A Little Night Music, which marked her Broadway debut. Set in Sweden during the early twentieth century, the musical follows the complicated relations between a group of people (including characters played by Zeta-Jones, Angela Lansbury and Alexander Hanson) during the course of a summer. She played Desirée Armfeldt, an ageing actress, and was particularly drawn to the complexities of the piece, explaining: \"There's no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings, ... It's not one of those shows where you can dig about three inches and come out the other end. You can keep digging and digging and digging\". She did not listen to past recordings of the songs in the musical so she could bring her own interpretation to them. The critic Claire Prentice of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Zeta-Jones brought in a \"quiet, reflective poignancy\" in her rendition of the song \"Send In the Clowns\", but Emma Brockes of The Guardian was more critical, remarking that \"with her pretty voice, head wresting this way and that, [she] seems to be auditioning for stage school\". For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Actress in a Musical.\n\n\n=== 2012–2016: Return to film ===\nAfter a three-year sabbatical from acting, she made her screen comeback in Lay the Favorite (2012), a comedy co-starring Bruce Willis and Rebecca Hall, in which she played the jealous wife of a gambler (Willis). Reviews of the film were negative, and Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times found Zeta-Jones to be \"far too shrill to amuse\". In the ensemble musical comedy Rock of Ages, co-starring Tom Cruise and Bryan Cranston, Zeta-Jones played the part of a religiously conservative wife of a mayor. She was attracted to the idea of playing a \"nightmare of a woman\" and based the role on the politician Michele Bachmann; the film received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Her final release of 2012 was Playing for Keeps, a romantic comedy with Gerard Butler, which proved to be her third box office failure of the year.\nIn 2013, Zeta-Jones took on a leading role in the crime thriller Broken City, co-starring Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe. The film tells the story of a private detective (Wahlberg) who is hired by the mayor of New York City (Crowe) to spy on his wife (Zeta-Jones). The critic Todd McCarthy thought that Zeta-Jones \"looks like class itself and nicely underplays\", and Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail observed that the actress \"does a fair, if incongruous, impersonation of a forties vamp\". As with her previous few projects, it was not widely seen and received poor reviews. This changed when Zeta-Jones collaborated with Soderbergh for the third time to film the critically acclaimed thriller Side Effects (2013). Co-starring Channing Tatum, Jude Law and Rooney Mara, the film saw her play a mysterious psychiatrist who recommends an antidepressant drug with serious side effects. Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film a \"hell of a thriller, twisty, terrific and packed with surprises\" and found Zeta-Jones to be \"dynamite\" in it.\nIn the action comedy Red 2 (2013), which served as a sequel to the 2010 film Red, Zeta-Jones played a seductive Russian double agent, alongside Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, and Mary-Louise Parker. She was drawn to the project, which follows the comic adventures of retired spies, for \"the action, the humour, [and] the tongue-in-cheek quality of it\". Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Justin Lowe stated that Zeta-Jones \"nicely pulls off Russian spy Katja's mix of allure and menace\", and with a worldwide gross of $148 million, Red 2 emerged as her most widely seen film since No Reservations.\nFollowing Red 2, Zeta-Jones took another sabbatical from acting, saying: \"If I'm going to leave my family for any length of time it had better be for a role that I haven't played before, [otherwise] I would prefer to stay at home\". She found such a part opposite Bill Nighy and Toby Jones in the British war comedy film Dad's Army (2016), based on the television sitcom of the same name. She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in Walmington-on-Sea. Catherine Bray of Variety considered the film to be an \"amiable but creaky resurrection\" of the sitcom, and added that while Zeta-Jones \"hits the required single note with some spirit\" she was \"generally underused\" in it.\n\n\n=== 2017–present: Television and streaming ===\n\nZeta-Jones returned to television in 2017, portraying actress Olivia de Havilland in the first season of Ryan Murphy's anthology drama series Feud, subtitled Bette and Joan, about the rivalry between the actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, respectively). Dominic Patten of Deadline Hollywood found Zeta-Jones to be \"wonderfully cast\" and Sonia Saraiya of Variety credited her for providing \"the best turn in the show\". Displeased with an \"unauthorized use of her name and identity\" in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of Feud for invasion of privacy and other personality rights. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a California appellate court.\nIn 2018, Zeta-Jones starred as the drug lord Griselda Blanco in the Lifetime television film Cocaine Godmother. Despite her character's misdeeds, she was drawn to her character's fortitude and ability to stand out in a male-dominated business. Writing for IndieWire, Hanh Nguyen criticised the decision to cast Zeta-Jones in the part of a Latino woman, adding that \"she's not just unconvincing; she's outlandish\". She next played the lead role of Vicki Ellis, an unrelenting pageant coach, in the Facebook Watch comedy-drama series Queen America. To play a character who has bulimia, she drew on her teenage experiences of interacting with dancers who had eating disorders. In a positive review, Jen Chaney of Vulture wrote that \"Zeta-Jones is always at her best when she's fiery, and this part gives her plenty of opportunities to shift into beast mode\".\nIn 2021, Zeta-Jones appeared in a recurring role in the second season of the Fox drama series Prodigal Son. She played Dr. Vivian Capshaw, a doctor, opposite Michael Sheen. The series was cancelled after its second season. She next took on a guest role as Morticia Addams in two episodes of the Netflix fantasy series Wednesday (2022). Dave Nemetz of TVLine found her \"exquisitely well-cast\" in her small part. Wednesday emerged as the second most-watched English-language Netflix series within three weeks of release. She subsequently played the main antagonist of the Disney+ adventure series National Treasure: Edge of History. Joshua Alston of Variety found Zeta-Jones to be the \"best thing\" about the show, adding that \"her snarling villainy veers so close to camp that it sounds at times like she’s workshopping a comedic impression of her own voice\". Her supporting performance earned her a nomination at the Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nIn 2025, Zeta-Jones reprised her role as Morticia Addams in the second season of the Netflix series Wednesday. Her performance received positive reviews, with Annabel Nugent of The Independent describing it as \"particularly enjoyable\" and Ben Travis of Empire finding her \"excellent\".  \nZeta-Jones will return to films with Cathy Yan's independent film The Gallerist, co-starring Natalie Portman and Jenna Ortega. She will also executive produce and star in the Prime Video thriller series Kill Jackie, adapted from Nick Harkaway's novel The Price You Pay, which will be filmed in her hometown of Swansea.\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\nAside from acting, Zeta-Jones supports various charities and causes. She is a patron of Swansea's Longfields Day Centre for the disabled, and has made sizeable donations to the centre. In 2001, she auctioned an outfit she wore in The Mask of Zorro (1998) to raise funds for AIDS patients in Africa. In 2005, she became the ambassador of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children charity, and launched the Full Stop appeal in Wales to raise awareness on child abuse. She has also given her support to other charitable organisations for children such as the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children and the Noah's Ark Appeal, among others. Zeta-Jones is also the founding host for A Fine Romance, an annual charitable program that helps raise funds for the Motion Picture & Television Fund, and is one of the members of the Cinema for Peace Foundation.\nZeta-Jones briefly dabbled with a singing career in the early 1990s. In 1992, she provided her voice to the character of Palene in Jeff Wayne's musical retelling of Spartacus, entitled Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of Spartacus. Three years later, she released her first single, \"In the Arms of Love\", on Wayne's Wow! Records. She sang \"True Love Ways\", a duet with David Essex, in 1994.\nZeta-Jones has featured as an advertising spokeswoman for several brands and products. She was named the global ambassador for the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, Inc. in 2002. Also that year, she was signed on by the phone company T-Mobile for an estimated $10 million per year, making her the highest-paid celebrity endorser at the time. In 2017, Zeta-Jones launched her own line of home decoration products named Casa Zeta-Jones. Also that year, she featured in a theatrical production of The Children's Monologues, in which she performed a monologue as a mathematically inclined young girl. The event raised funds for Dramatic Need, a charity that helps African children pursue a career in the arts.\n\n\n== Media image ==\n\nZeta-Jones's beauty and sex appeal have been picked up by various media outlets, including People magazine, which placed her at number one on their \"Most Beautiful People\" listing in 1998. She continued to feature on the list from 2000 to 2004. In 2003, Esquire labelled her \"the most beautiful woman on the planet\". In 2011, she was named the most beautiful British woman by a poll conducted by the television network QVC. She was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2010 Birthday Honours for her film and charity work. In 2019, she was honoured with the Freedom of the City of Swansea.\nThe journalist Sheila Johnston of The Daily Telegraph, in 2010, described Zeta-Jones as \"the ultimate self-made success\" who \"constantly made bold decisions, and scrubbed up very nicely into a luscious star who radiates a classic […] brand of big-screen glamour.\" Guy Adams of The Independent considers her personality to be \"self-effacing and energetic\" but takes note of her \"steely core\" in her off-screen persona. Zeta-Jones's success in her early Hollywood films The Mask of Zorro (1998) and Entrapment (1999) relied predominantly on her sex appeal, but she was later appreciated for her versatility.\nZeta-Jones's career graph and marriage to Douglas have been a subject of satire. A 2006 episode of the satirical British television show Star Stories (2006–2008) was entitled Catherine Zeta-Jones—Her Quest to Prove Herself ... And Also Find Love, about a fictitious life story of Zeta-Jones. Addressing her perceived media image, she remarked in a 2004 interview with USA Weekend: \"The biggest misconception of me is that I'm some die-hard, ambitious, do-anything-to-get-anything kind of person, I'm not. I'm very shy socially.\" Zeta-Jones is protective of her public image, and the use of her likeness is carefully controlled. As well as taking legal action against Hello! magazine, she sued a Nevada-based topless club for including her image on their advertising. In 2003, the celebrity biographer Cliff Goodwin wrote an unauthorised biography of the actress, entitled Catherine Zeta Jones: The Biography, but the publication was indefinitely postponed after her lawyers issued threats of legal action against both Goodwin and his publisher.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nThe success of The Darling Buds of May (1991–93) made Zeta-Jones a celebrity in Britain, and her personal life has since been chronicled by the media. Her relationships in the early 1990s with television personality John Leslie, singer David Essex, and pop star Mick Hucknall were heavily publicised by the British press. In the mid-1990s, she was briefly engaged to Scottish actor Angus Macfadyen. In a 1995 interview with the Daily Mirror, she described her lifestyle thus: \"I drink, I swear, I like sex\".\n\nZeta-Jones met American actor Michael Douglas, with whom she shares her birthday and who is twenty-five years her senior, at the Deauville American Film Festival in France in August 1998, after being introduced by Danny DeVito. They became engaged on 31 December 1999, and married at the Plaza Hotel in New York City on 18 November 2000 after Douglas's divorce was finalised. Douglas insisted on a pre-nuptial agreement after his first wife, Diandra, was awarded 60 million USD when the couple divorced. The high-profile ceremony, which cost an estimated £1.5 million, was labelled the \"wedding of the year\" by the BBC. They signed a £1 million deal with OK! magazine to release photographs of the event, and the rest of the press were not permitted to enter. In spite of this, journalists for Hello! magazine surreptitiously took pictures of the ceremony, and the couple successfully sued the publication for invasion of privacy. They have two children: son Dylan Michael (born August 2000) and daughter Carys Zeta (born April 2003). The family lived in Bermuda until 2009, and as of 2016, live in rural New York state. They also have a coastal estate near Valldemossa, Mallorca. In an interview with The Times, Zeta-Jones revealed that she and Douglas own 4 properties, one in Canada, one in Spain, and two in New York.\nIn 2010, Douglas was diagnosed with tongue cancer and Zeta-Jones thus faced an emotionally turbulent time, saying: \"When you get sideswiped like that [with the illness] it's an obvious trigger for your balance to be a little bit off – not sleeping, worry, stress.\" This trigger led to Zeta-Jones experiencing depression, and despite initial apprehension, she went public with her bipolar disorder diagnosis. She sought treatment by checking into hospital in 2011, and again in 2013. Owing to the stress of both their illnesses, the couple decided to live separately in 2013, though without taking legal action towards separation or divorce. They reconciled in 2014, with Douglas saying they were \"stronger than ever\".\n\n\n== Acting credits and awards ==\n\nZeta-Jones's films that have earned the most at the box office, as of 2016, include:\n\nFor her role in Chicago (2002), Zeta-Jones was awarded the Academy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. She has received two Golden Globe Award nominations: Best Supporting Actress for Traffic (2000) and Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical for Chicago (2002). For her leading role in Broadway's 2009 revival of A Little Night Music, Zeta-Jones was awarded the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nCatherine Zeta-Jones at IMDb \nCatherine Zeta-Jones at the Internet Broadway Database \nCatherine Zeta-Jones at the TCM Movie Database \nCatherine Zeta-Jones at Playbill Vault",

        "title": "Lyle and Erik Menendez",
        "content": "Joseph Lyle Menendez (born January 10, 1968) and Erik Galen Menendez (born November 27, 1970), commonly referred to as the Menendez brothers, are American brothers convicted of killing their parents, José and Mary Louise \"Kitty\" Menendez, at their Beverly Hills home in 1989.\nFollowing the murders, Lyle and Erik claimed that unknown intruders were responsible for the murders, framing it as a potential mob killing. Police initially investigated this claim, but grew suspicious when they discovered the brothers' extravagant spending sprees following the murders, and the fact that they had hired a computer expert to delete their father's recently updated will. Erik confessed to the murders in sessions with his psychologist, citing a desire to be free of a controlling father with high standards, which led to their arrests months later.\nLyle and Erik were charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for lying in wait, making them eligible for the death penalty, and charges of conspiracy to murder. During their first trial, the defense argued that the brothers killed their parents in self-defense after years of alleged sexual, emotional, and physical abuse. The prosecution argued that the murders were premeditated, that allegations of sexual abuse were fabricated, and that the brothers were motivated by hatred and a desire to receive their father's multimillion-dollar estate after being disinherited from his will. The juries were unable to reach a verdict, resulting in mistrials for both brothers. In a second trial, they were convicted for first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\nBeginning in 1998, the brothers began numerous successive legal appeals of their convictions, which were reviewed and rejected by judges. In October 2024, Los Angeles district attorney George Gascón recommended a resentencing after reviewing a habeas corpus petition. After Gascón's loss in the November 2024 election, newly elected district attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the habeas petition, calling the brothers' self-defense claims \"lies.\" In May 2025, a judge resentenced the brothers to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole. In August 2025, however, Erik and Lyle were both denied parole.\nThe highly publicized trials received international media attention, inspiring numerous documentaries, dramatizations, books, and parodies.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJosé Enrique Menendez was born on May 6, 1944, in Havana, Cuba. At age 16, in the wake of the Cuban Revolution, he moved to the United States. José attended Southern Illinois University, where he met Mary Louise \"Kitty\" Andersen (1941–1989). They married in 1963 and moved to New York City, where José earned an accounting degree from Queens College.\nThe couple's first son, Joseph Lyle, who goes by his middle name, was born on January 10, 1968 in New York. Kitty quit her teaching job after Lyle was born, and the family moved to New Jersey, where Erik Galen was born on November 27, 1970, in Gloucester Township. The family lived in Hopewell Township, and both brothers attended Princeton Day School.\nJosé became an executive at Hertz Corporation and later RCA Records. After he was appointed as the CEO of Live Entertainment, the family moved to Calabasas, California, where Erik attended Calabasas High School.\nIn 1988, Lyle and Erik committed multiple burglaries in their neighborhood, stealing more than $100,000 in cash and jewelry, prompting José and Kitty to move to Beverly Hills. The following year, Erik attended Beverly Hills High School, where he earned average grades but displayed a talent for tennis, ranking 44th in the US as a junior. About two weeks before the murders, Erik and his friend Michael Joyce entered the 1989 Boys' Junior National Tennis Championship.\nLyle attended Princeton University, where he was placed on academic probation for poor grades and eventually suspended for plagiarism. He lived in the Gauss Hall, a dormitory, where he reportedly threw out his roommates' belongings as he did not wish to share a room, left sinks overflowing causing damage, and repainted his room in violation of university rules.\nIn high school, Erik co-wrote an amateur screenplay titled Friends with his classmate, telling the story of a wealthy young man who committed the \"perfect murder\" by killing his parents for their inheritance.\n\n\n== Murders and investigation ==\n\n\n=== Murders and alibi ===\nOn August 18, 1989, Lyle and Erik went to several gun stores in Southern California to buy handguns. However, due to issues with Lyle's California driver's license and a two-week waiting period mandated by gun laws, the brothers decided to purchase shotguns instead. They acquired Mossberg 12-gauge shotguns along with boxes of birdshot and buckshot ammunition in a Big 5 Sporting Goods store in San Diego, California, where Erik used a stolen driver's license from Lyle's friend, Donovan Goodreau.\nOn the evening of August 20, 1989, José and Kitty were watching The Spy Who Loved Me in the theater den of their Beverly Hills mansion, when Lyle and Erik entered, carrying loaded shotguns. José was shot six times, including a fatal shot to the back of his head. Kitty was shot 10 times. Before the fatal shot to her cheek, she was on the floor, crawling away. Lyle ran to the car where Erik handed him ammunition to reload before firing the fatal shot to her face.\nImmediately after the killings, both brothers remained in the house for a few minutes, expecting a police response to the gunshot noise. They left to dispose of their blood-stained clothes and later buried the shotguns somewhere along Mulholland Drive. They also went to a movie theater and attempted to purchase tickets for the film Batman to use as their alibi, but abandoned the plan when they realized the theater time-stamped its ticket stubs. They then headed to the \"Taste of L.A.\" festival at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.\nAfter returning home and finding no police presence, Lyle called 911 and emotionally told the operator, \"someone killed my parents,\" saying that he had just come home and discovered their bodies. Erik was heard screaming and crying in the background. When the officers arrived, Lyle and Erik ran from the home toward the officers while screaming. When the police arrived, they did not seek gunshot residue tests from the brothers, which would have indicated whether they had recently discharged a firearm. Lyle and Erik both falsely told officers that they were elsewhere at the time of the killings. Lyle told officers he thought the killings might be \"business-related,\" implying a Mafia hit.\nPolice officers and forensic staff who worked on the crime scene described it as \"the most brutal\" one they had ever encountered, noting the blood and brain matter splattered throughout the room. Retired police detective Dan Stewart stated, \"I've seen a lot of homicides, but nothing quite that brutal. Blood, flesh, skulls. It would be hard to describe, especially José, as resembling a human that you would recognize. That's how bad it was.\" According to the autopsy report, one blast caused \"explosive decapitation with evisceration of the brain\" and \"deformity of the face\" to José, while the first round of shots struck Kitty in her chest, right arm, left hip, and left leg, with the contact shot causing \"multiple lacerations of the brain\".\n\n\n=== Investigation and arrests ===\nDetectives initially investigated Lyle's suggestion that the murders were a result of mob-related activity, due to its heinousness and José's business connections.\nIn the months after the killings, the brothers spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on luxury items, businesses, and travel. Lyle bought Chuck's Spring Street Café, a Buffalo wing restaurant in Princeton, New Jersey, as well as three Rolex watches and a Porsche Carrera sports car. Erik hired a full-time tennis coach and competed in a series of tournaments overseas. The brothers eventually left the Beverly Hills mansion unoccupied, choosing to live in adjoining condominiums in nearby Marina del Rey. They also dined at high-end restaurants and took overseas trips to the Caribbean and London. \nTheir court-side attendance at a New York Knicks basketball game was captured in the background of a Mark Jackson trading card. During this time, they spent approximately $700,000. Most of this money came from a $650,000 personal life insurance policy, which was paid out, although a larger insurance policy for $15 million with LIVE Entertainment as beneficiaries, not the Menendez brothers, turned out to be invalid. This spending caused police to begin to consider the brothers as suspects, with a possible financial motive. Family members disputed a connection between their spending and the murder of their parents, asserting that there were no changes in their spending habits after the killings.\nErik's high school friend Craig Cignarelli reported to the police that Erik had confessed to him. He also revealed that he and Erik had previously written a 66-page screenplay titled Friends, which depicted a son killing his wealthy parents for their inheritance. In an attempt to get a confession, police arranged for Cignarelli to wear a wire during a lunch with Erik. When Cignarelli asked Erik whether he had killed his parents, Erik denied it.\nPolice also heard from Lyle's friend Glenn Stevens that one week after the killings, Lyle had made a sudden trip back home from Princeton to destroy something in the family computer. Stevens said that Lyle told him a family member \"found a new will and I went there and erased it.\" A computer expert hired by Lyle also said he was hired to ensure deletion of a new will José had prepared which may have left less to his sons.\nErik eventually confessed to his psychologist, Jerome Oziel, who then told his mistress, Judalon Smyth. Oziel began recording his sessions with Lyle and Erik. After breaking up with Oziel, Smyth informed the police about the brothers' involvement in the murders. Lyle was arrested on March 8, 1990 outside their Beverly Hills home, while Erik turned himself in three days later after returning to Los Angeles from Israel, where he participated in a tennis tournament. Both were held without bail and jailed separately at the Los Angeles County Jail.\n\n\n== Trials ==\n\n\n=== Pretrial detention and legal disputes ===\nIn August 1990, Judge James Albracht ruled that tapes of the conversations between Erik and his psychologist Jerome Oziel were admissible evidence since Oziel claimed that Lyle threatened him and thus violated doctor–patient privilege. Albracht's ruling was appealed, after which the proceedings were delayed for two years. The Supreme Court of California ruled in August 1992 that most of the tapes were admissible, with the exception of the tape on which Erik discussed the murders.\nAfter that decision, a Los Angeles County grand jury issued indictments in December 1992, charging the brothers with the murders of their parents; the special circumstances that the killings were committed for financial gain was deemed unsupported by evidence and was subsequently excluded from the charges. They were charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for lying in wait, which made them eligible for the death penalty. On January 12, 1993, the prosecution announced they would seek the death penalty for the brothers, at a hearing presided over by Judge Lance Ito. At the same hearing, Ito assigned Stanley Weisberg to serve as the trial judge.\n\n\n=== First trial (1993–1994) ===\nThe first trial began in July 1993; cameras were allowed in the courtroom and the trial was broadcast on Court TV. Represented by lead defense lawyers Leslie Abramson (for Erik) and Jill Lansing (for Lyle), the brothers stated that they killed their parents out of fear for their lives after a lifetime of abuse at the hands of their parents, especially sexual abuse at the hands of their father, who was described as a cruel perfectionist and pedophile. Meanwhile, their mother was described as an enabling, selfish, mentally unstable alcoholic and drug addict who encouraged her husband's behavior and was also violent toward the brothers. \nLyle alleged that his father began abusing him at age 6, but stopped when he was 8 without explanation. Erik alleged he was abused up until adulthood, shortly prior to the murders. Erik testified that two weeks before the killings, he first told Lyle about the sexual abuse he was experiencing, leading to multiple confrontations within the family. \nBoth brothers testified that their father had threatened to kill them if they did not keep the abuse secret. As a result, they purchased shotguns for \"protection and self-defense\". They alleged that the final confrontation occurred in their home's den on August 20, 1989, shortly before Kitty and José were killed. According to their testimony, José closed the den's door, which they described as \"unusual\". They testified that they were afraid that they would be killed by their parents, so went outside to load their shotguns, and Erik recalled, \"As I went into the room, I just started firing.\"\nUnder California law, the brothers could be eligible for conviction of manslaughter only if they could prove they were in immediate or imminent danger. The prosecution argued there was no evidence of imminent danger or self defense. Prosecutor Pam Bozanich argued this was contradicted by the brothers purchasing shotguns in advance. Prosecutors used the taped conversation between the brothers and their psychologist, in which the brothers said they had planned the murders \"beforehand\". Prosecution argued the murders were inconsistent with a self defense killing; after they had shot their mother Kitty who was \"moaning and trying to crawl away\", Lyle went to reload his shotgun and returned to complete the murder.\nThe prosecution argued that the sexual abuse allegations were fabricated, as nobody mentioned abuse until a legal defense was being formulated seven months after the murders. The prosecution told jurors that mention of sexual abuse was absent in discussions and tapes with their psychologist, Jerome Oziel, and that Erik did not mention abuse in his earlier confession to his friend Craig Cignarelli. The prosecution told jurors throughout the trial that Lyle and Erik were capable of lying frequently and in great detail to avoid being caught, and thus they were also capable of lying about child abuse to avoid death sentences. Prosecutor Pam Bozanich played Lyle's staged 911 call for the jurors with the intention of showing how good an actor he was.\nPrior to the trial, Lyle offered his ex-girlfriend Jamie Pisarcik money if she would lie for him in the trial and claim that José Menendez had made sexual advances towards her; Pisarcik reported this to the police. Before Lyle was cross-examined by the prosecution, he pre-emptively admitted this under questioning by his own lawyer.\nLyle and Erik's cousin, Diane Vander Molen, testified that during a stay with the family in the mid-1970s, Lyle confided in her that his father was sexually abusing him. Vander Molen claimed she told Kitty about the incident, but Kitty sided with her husband, accusing Lyle of lying. Vander Molen recalled that after this, Kitty sent Lyle upstairs, and she never heard of the issue again. Under questioning from Pam Bozanich, Vander Molen said she had never witnessed any abuse. Lyle testified that Vander Molen was the only person he ever told of the abuse. Another cousin, Andy Cano, alleged that as a child, Erik told him about the abuse, which they both described as genital \"massages\". Prosecutors pressed Cano, asking him if he would lie for his cousin, which he denied.\nThe defense presented two faceless photographs of young boys from the waist down, which Lyle alleged were taken by their father when they were little. The prosecution argued that there was no evidence the photographs were taken by José, and the photos were found on a roll of film interspersed with photos from a children's birthday party.\nEvidence from a taped therapy session between the brothers and their psychologist, Jerome Oziel, was also presented in court, after legal attempts by the defense to exclude it. The prosecution used the tapes to disprove the abuse claims, as the brothers made no mention of sexual abuse, and instead complained about their dictatorial father and suicidal mother. Lyle also stated that by killing their mother, they may be \"doing her and [him and Erik] a favor... putting her out of her misery\" and that they had \"shown great courage by killing their mother\". According to Oziel's account, \"They didn't kill their parents for money but rather out of hatred and out of a desire to be free from their father's domination, messages of inadequacy, and impossible standards.\" Oziel said that Lyle had confided that \"he knew his father would have been proud of him for killing him\" for pulling off the task.\nThe defense consultant Ann Burgess argued Oziel was \"manipulative\" and \"controlling\", arguing he directed many of the statements made by the brothers in the tape recordings. Oziel's ex-mistress, Judalon Smyth, also testified that Oziel wanted to \"control\" the brothers by taping their sessions. Smyth's testimony was challenged by the prosecution, noting she was the one who notified the authorities of the confession tapes, but had now joined the defense to discredit Oziel after a tumultuous breakup.\nErik testified that he put cinnamon in his father's tea and coffee to make his semen taste better. The plausibility of this claim was disputed because cinnamon is a detectable flavor. Prosecutor Lester Kuriyama proposed that José had not forced Erik into sex acts, but was furious that his son was potentially homosexual, and this may have caused tensions within the family. Judge Weisberg refused to allow Kuriyama to discuss the idea. The defense argued Kuriyama's idea was \"disgusting\", while Kuriyama argued it was relevant because one witness claimed to have seen gay porn magazines in the house, implying that José was sexually attracted to men; however, the meaning would change if they belonged to Erik. Erik alleged his mother \"made it seem like it was worse than death to be gay, and I didn't think I was, I just—I don't know\", and followed up by saying he liked girls and enjoyed his relationship with his girlfriend.\nThe prosecution wanted to allow the jury to see a screenplay that Erik had written with his friend Craig in high school, a story about a wealthy young man who killed his parents for the inheritance money. Judge Weisberg ruled against it, saying the play was written too long before the shooting to have relevance.\nThe defense also won a ruling against the use of the word \"sociopath\" in front of juries. Oziel told the court he had described to the boys the difference between a crime of passion, and a crime of assault, and that in response they described themselves as \"sociopaths\". The judge said the label was too prejudicial to announce in front of a jury. A defense witness, psychologist Anne Tyler, described Erik's burglaries of more than $100,000 in cash and jewellery as the \"acting out behavior\" of an adolescent.\nBoth verdicts for the brothers were divided by gender; female jurors suggested voluntary manslaughter, while male jurors pushed for first-degree murder. After a month of deliberations, the trial ended in a mistrial in January 1994, due to the two deadlocked juries. Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti opted to retry the brothers, as opposed to offering a plea bargain to secure convictions on lesser charges.\n\n\n=== Second trial (1995–1996) ===\nThe second trial was less publicized, in part because Judge Stanley Weisberg did not allow cameras in the courtroom because it would \"increase the risk that jurors would be exposed to information and commentary about the case outside of the courtroom\".\nErik testified over 15 days about allegations of abuse. Judge Weisberg limited some of the testimony about certain allegations of abuse on the third day. Judge Weisberg limited the defense to 64 total witnesses in the retrial. Erik alleged that José had told him he was written out of the will.\nLyle's former fiancée, Jamie Pisarcik, testified that Lyle had tried to bribe her to testify falsely in the first trial. Pisarcik said that Lyle told her fictitious stories about the mob killing of his parents, which she originally believed. She testified that during a regular visit to see Lyle in prison, he offered her a large sum of money to claim that José Menendez made sexual advances towards her.\nLyle did not testify in the second trial. Prosecutor David Conn told jurors that Lyle had asked his friend Brian Eslaminia to fabricate a story in the first trial. A 7-page letter was found by the police, allegedly written by Lyle detailing how he wanted him to testify.\nThe prosecution also had another letter that Lyle had allegedly written to his ex-girlfriend Traci Baker from jail. It included instructions on how to testify, with the sentence: \"We will decide later around what date this incident occurred.\" The defense disputed its authenticity. Baker was not reached for comment.\nConn challenged Erik's allegation that he was raped at the age of 18, when he had a vehicle and enough money to leave his parents' home. Conn asked him why he did not join the army. Erik said he would not be safe from his father in the army, because he was \"the most powerful man I've ever met\". Erik said there were no witnesses to his allegations of sexual abuse.\nPsychology professor John Wilson, an expert witness for the defense, testified that Erik had symptoms of PTSD which supported his allegations of abuse. Prosecution expert witness, psychiatrist Park Elliot Dietz, countered that there was no way to know if he had PTSD because the allegations were unproven. He argued Erik did not show symptoms of \"learned helplessness\", as he had purchased guns and practiced with them at the shooting range.\nLeslie Abramson argued that the brothers acted out fear that their parents would harm them for threatening to reveal the family's secrets, and that the killings were a \"highly emotional overkill\".\nJudge Weisberg determined that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim that the brothers were in imminent danger when they murdered their parents. However, he allowed the defense to argue that the brothers shot José in the heat of passion, but not their mother, Kitty. He concluded that while there was enough evidence to suggest José might have provoked his sons into committing homicide, there was not enough to indicate that Kitty did.\nKlara Wright, wife of the attorney hired by the brothers, testified that the brothers had brought a safe to her home in hopes of locating a copy of their parents' will. The safe was opened two days after the murders, in the presence of Brian Andersen and Carlos Baralt, the brothers' uncles. It was found to be empty. Conn argued this was evidence the brothers were trying to access their parents' money as quickly as possible.\nBoth brothers were eventually convicted on two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for lying in wait, as well as conspiracy to murder; in the penalty phase of the trial, they were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nDuring the penalty phase, Abramson reportedly told defense witness William Vicary to edit his own notes of meetings with Erik to remove potentially damning information, but the district attorney's office decided not to launch a criminal investigation of Abramson. Both brothers also filed motions for a mistrial, claiming that they suffered irreversible damage in the penalty phase as a result of possible misconduct and ineffective representation by Abramson. On July 2, 1996, Weisberg sentenced the brothers to life in prison without the possibility of parole, to be served as consecutive sentences for the killings and the charges of conspiracy to commit murder.\n\n\n== Appeals ==\nOn February 27, 1998, the California Court of Appeal upheld the brothers' murder convictions and, on May 28, 1998, the Supreme Court of California declined to review the case, thus allowing the decision of the appellate court to stand. Both brothers filed habeas corpus petitions with the Supreme Court of California, which were denied in 1999. Having exhausted their appeal remedies in state court, they filed separate habeas corpus petitions in the United States District Court. On March 4, 2003, a magistrate judge recommended the denial of the petitions, and the district court adopted the recommendation. The brothers then decided to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On September 7, 2005, a three-judge panel denied both their habeas corpus petitions.\nIn May 2023, the brothers requested a new hearing based upon an allegation that their father had raped former Menudo member Roy Rosselló, who, at that time, was signed under RCA Records. Specifically, on April 18, 2023, on a segment of the Today Show about a television documentary, Rosselló stated that when he was 14 years old, he was drugged and raped by José Menendez while he was visiting the Menendez family's home in New Jersey. The appeal cites a letter that appears to have been written by Erik to his cousin, Andy Cano, in 1988, where Erik talked about the abuse. Robert Rand, the author of The Menendez Murders, says he found it in 2018 in a dresser in Cano's bedroom.\nOn October 3, 2024, Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón announced in a press conference that his office was actively reviewing the appeal. On October 24, 2024, Gascón announced he was asking the court for a resentencing of the case. If a judge accepted his recommendation, the brothers would be eligible for parole. Gascón stated \"I don't believe that manslaughter would have been the appropriate charge given the premeditation that was involved,\" and \"I do believe that the brothers were subjected to a tremendous amount of dysfunction in the home, and molestation.\" Gascón's recommendation considered the length of time the brothers had already served, and their behavior while in prison.\nA re-sentencing trial was initially scheduled to begin on December 11, 2024. However, during a court hearing on November 25, 2024, the trial would be pushed back to January 30 and 31, 2025. The resentencing hearing was postponed to March 20, 2025, due to the Los Angeles fires. On March 21, the hearing was once again pushed back to April 2025. On March 24, California governor Gavin Newsom announced a June 13, 2025 deadline for the brothers' resentencing via his podcast This is Gavin Newsom.\nNewly elected district attorney Nathan Hochman reversed Gascón's recommendations for resentencing and filed an opposition to the habeas corpus petition. Hochman called the claims of self-defense \"self serving lies\" and stated that the letter allegedly sent to Cano was not credible, because it was not used in either defense.\nIn May 2025, a judge resentenced the brothers to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole because they were under 26 years old when they committed the crime. On August 21, 2025, Erik was denied parole by the California Board of Parole Hearings, citing ongoing rule violations and concerns about public safety. Lyle was also denied parole the following day, with the board referencing repeated cell phone infractions. Both will be eligible for a second hearing in 2028.\n\n\n== Marriages ==\nOn July 2, 1996, Lyle married Anna Eriksson by telephone at a ceremony attended by Abramson and his aunt Marta Menendez, officiated by Judge Nancy Brown; they divorced on April 1, 2001, after Eriksson discovered that Lyle was cheating on her by writing to another woman. In November 2003, Lyle married Rebecca Sneed at a ceremony in a visiting area of Mule Creek State Prison; they had known each other for around 10 years before their engagement. Lyle and Sneed separated in 2024.\nOn June 12, 1999, Erik married Tammi Ruth Saccoman in the waiting room of Folsom State Prison. Tammi later stated: \"Our wedding cake was a Twinkie. We improvised. It was a wonderful ceremony until I had to leave. That was a very lonely night.\" In an October 2005 interview with ABC News, she described her relationship with Erik as \"something that I've dreamed about for a long time. And it's just something very special that I never thought that I would ever have.\"\nIn 2005, Saccoman self-published a book, They Said We'd Never Make It—My Life with Erik Menendez. She conceded on CNN's Larry King Live that Erik \"did a lot of editing on the book.\" In an interview with People magazine, she also stated:\n\nNot having sex in my life is difficult, but it's not a problem for me. I have to be emotionally attached, and I'm emotionally attached to Erik ... My family does not understand. When it started to get serious, some of them just threw up their hands.\nSaccoman also stated that she and her daughter drove 150 mi (240 km) every weekend to visit Erik, and that her daughter refers to him as her \"Earth Dad\". Discussing his life sentence in a 2005 interview with People, Erik stated: \"Tammi is what gets me through. I can't think about the sentence. When I do, I do it with a great sadness and a primal fear. I break into a cold sweat. It's so frightening I just haven't come to terms with it.\"\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Documentary ===\nIn 2000, \"Menendez Brothers – Blood Brothers\", an episode from the documentary series by Court TV (now TruTV) Mugshots, was aired at FilmRise.\nIn 2015, Barbara Walters Presents: American Scandals featured the Menendez brothers in an episode, \"Menendez Brothers: The Bad Sons\".\nIn 2017, the Menendez brothers were featured in a documentary, Truth and Lies: The Menendez Brothers – American Sons, American Murderers on ABC.\nIn 2017, A&E aired a five-part documentary titled The Menendez Murders: Erik Tells All, in which Erik describes via telephone the murders and the aftermath.

There are several characters who have worked in the brothers' and O. J. Simpson's respective cases, such as Robert Shapiro, Lance Ito, and Gil Garcetti. Shapiro (portrayed by John Travolta) mentioned Erik in Episode 2 stating, \"In fact, I arranged the surrender of Erik Menendez from Israel.\" This statement is based on the actual speech by Shapiro during Simpson's infamous Bronco chase, in an attempt to have him surrender to police.\nOn October 3, 2024, Kim Kardashian published an article on NBC news endorsing the push for Menendez brothers to be freed from prison. In this article, Kardashian states, \"Had this crime been committed and trialed today, I believe the outcome would have been dramatically different.\"\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThe Menendez brothers are seen in the background of the 1990–91 NBA Hoops' Mark Jackson basketball card, in which the New York Knicks point guard is seen making a bounce pass. They are sitting courtside behind Jackson. In December 2018, eBay began terminating auctions in which the brothers are mentioned in the listing. Some eBay sellers have continued to sell the card by altering the images accompanying the listing so that the Menendez brothers are neither mentioned nor seen in photos of the card accompanying the listing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of homicides in California\nTrial of the century\nSchoklender case – Caso Schoklender\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nMenendez v.

        "title": "The Thursday Murder Club (film)",
        "content": "The Thursday Murder Club is a 2025 crime comedy film directed by Chris Columbus from a screenplay by Katy Brand and Suzanne Heathcote, based on the 2020 novel by Richard Osman. The film stars Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley, and Celia Imrie with David Tennant, Jonathan Pryce, Naomi Ackie, Daniel Mays, Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Richard E. Grant, Tom Ellis, Geoff Bell, Paul Freeman, Sarah Niles, and Ingrid Oliver in supporting roles. Its plot follows a group of elderly amateur sleuths who attempt to solve a murder.\nThe Thursday Murder Club premiered on 21 August in Leicester Square, London, ahead of its release on 22 August in 30 select cinemas, and its streaming debut by Netflix on 28 August 2025. It received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt Coopers Chase, a retirement village, psychiatrist Ibrahim, former trade union leader Ron, and ex-spy Liz are members of the Thursday Murder Club (TMC), which meets weekly to discuss old cold cases. They are soon joined by Joyce, a retired nurse and new resident, whose medical knowledge proves useful. The group is inspired by a case once handled by Detective Inspector Penny Gray, now in hospice, involving the unsolved murder of Angela Hughes. Police Constable Donna De Fritas, recently transferred from London, visits the village and strikes up a friendship with the TMC. She confides that her work feels tedious, and the club eagerly draws her into their investigations.\nMeanwhile, conflict brews over plans to redevelop Coopers Chase into luxury flats. One of the owners, Ian Ventham, pushes the project forward, while his partner Tony Curran opposes it, promising the residents that he will block the sale. Shortly afterwards, Tony is murdered in his own home, his house ransacked and the weapon missing.\nThe TMC resolve to investigate. With Donna's help, they learn that local crime boss Bobby Tanner is secretly involved in the business, and that Ron's estranged son Jason once worked with Tony. Suspicion briefly falls on Ian, but he is soon ruled out. During a residents' protest, Ian himself collapses and dies from a fentanyl overdose, leaving Tanner the sole owner. Jason is arrested, though the evidence against him proves weak.\nLiz develops a cautious friendship with Bogdan, a Polish handyman employed at the village. He reveals a hidden grave containing a skeleton, later identified as Peter Mercer, the man who witnessed Angela's death years earlier. Liz also begins receiving threats, warning her to leave the matter alone.\nWhen Jason provides an alibi, the TMC turn their attention back to Tanner. Liz and Donna discover that he has been trafficking migrants and seizing their passports. Liz confronts him and strikes a bargain: he is to keep Coopers Chase intact in return for her silence. She then realises that Bogdan was responsible for Tony's death. Bogdan later admits, while playing chess with Stephen, that he killed Tony under pressure but had not intended it. His confession is secretly recorded, and he is arrested.\nThe truth about Angela's murder also emerges. The TMC deduce that Mercer killed her, but that Penny, with her husband John's assistance, secretly took justice into her own hands by killing Mercer and concealing his body. When Ian later stumbled upon the grave, John murdered him to protect Penny. Both Penny and John die soon after in hospice care.\nAt their funeral, Liz presents Penny's club necklace to Joyce, formally welcoming her as a full member of the TMC. With Coopers Chase once more up for sale, Joanna, Joyce's daughter, considers buying it. Life in the village resumes quietly, with friendships renewed and the club ready for whatever mystery may come next.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nHelen Mirren as Elizabeth Best, a retired MI6 officer\nPierce Brosnan as Ron Ritchie, a retired union leader\nBen Kingsley as Ibrahim Arif, a retired psychiatrist\nCelia Imrie as Joyce, a retired nurse\nNaomi Ackie as Donna De Freitas, a local police officer\nDaniel Mays as DCI Chris Hudson\nHenry Lloyd-Hughes as Bogdan\nTom Ellis as Jason, Ron's son\nDavid Tennant as Ian Ventham\nJonathan Pryce as Stephen, Elizabeth's husband\nPaul Freeman as John\nGeoff Bell as Tony Curran\nIngrid Oliver as Joanna, Joyce's daughter\nJoseph Marcell as Father Mackie\nRuth Sheen as Aunt Maud\nRichard E. Grant as Bobby Tanner\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn March 2020, it was announced that Ol Parker would write and direct a film adaptation of Richard Osman's debut novel The Thursday Murder Club for Amblin Entertainment, after Amblin acquired the worldwide rights to the project, with Jennifer Todd serving as producer and Osman serving as executive producer. In March 2023, Osman said filming was set to begin in September 2023 with Steven Spielberg as producer. In November 2023, it was reported that filming was scheduled to begin in March 2024. However, in February 2024 Osman said he was hopeful filming would commence in August 2024 after delays during the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. In April 2024, Chris Columbus was announced to replace Parker as writer, co-producer and director. A few days later, it was announced that the project had been acquired by Netflix.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn May 2024, Celia Imrie joined the cast as Joyce, with Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan and Ben Kingsley also part of the main cast. In June 2024, David Tennant, Jonathan Pryce, Naomi Ackie, Daniel Mays and Henry Lloyd-Hughes joined the cast. Katy Brand announced on Instagram that she had written the final screenplay for the film on June 18, 2024. In July 2024, Richard E. Grant, Ingrid Oliver and Tom Ellis were among those added to the cast.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began on 27 June 2024, at Shepperton Studios. Filming also took place in Beaconsfield in July 2024. In September 2024, Osman appeared on The Chris Moyles Show and revealed that filming would wrap the same day.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe Thursday Murder Club was released in select cinemas on 22 August 2025, before its streaming debut by Netflix on 28 August 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 77% of 105 critics' reviews are positive. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 61 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nKat Halstead of Common Sense Media awarded the film with 4 stars out of 5 rating, and wrote, \"It lags slightly in places, and at two hours is a little overlong, but this is a successful jump from page to screen that leaves a promising door open for future adaptations from the series.\" Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com wrote, \"The Thursday Murder Club is engaging and often amusing. The plot contains enough surprises that the \"whodunit\" generates real suspense. The characters aren't particularly well-developed, but neither are they stereotypes. The film feels more like a television pilot than a stand-alone film, which may be exactly what Netflix is looking for. \nIn a negative review, Laura Venning of Empire gave the film 2 stars out of 5 rating, while stating, \"Maybe this would hit the spot for a Sunday-night sofa slump but it's more patronising than perceptive when it comes to portraying ageing. As disappointing as a stale scone.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Thursday Murder Club on Netflix \nThe Thursday Murder Club at IMDb",

Destin Daniel Cretton was hired to direct The Kang Dynasty and Jonathan Majors was set to reprise his MCU role as the villain Kang the Conqueror. Jeff Loveness joined the film as writer that September. In November 2023, Cretton departed, Waldron replaced Loveness as writer, and Marvel was considering moving away from the Kang storyline, in part due to Majors's legal issues; Majors was fired the following month. The return of the Russo brothers as directors and McFeely as co-writer, the casting of Downey as new villain Doctor Doom, and the new subtitle Doomsday were all announced in July 2024. Filming began in April 2025 at Pinewood Studios in England, with a large cast consisting mainly of actors from previous MCU media and 20th Century Fox's Marvel films. Location filming is taking place in England and Bahrain.\nAvengers: Doomsday is scheduled to be released in the United States on December 18, 2026, as part of Phase Six of the MCU.

Cumming said the make-up process was reduced to an hour-and-a-half for Doomsday from the four-and-a-half to five hours it took on the 20th Century Fox film X2 (2003), in large part because the character's tattoos were no longer applied individually by hand.

He felt Downey, who previously starred as Tony Stark / Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), was the one person who could take on the role.

There are conflicting reports about whether Ryan Reynolds will reprise his role as Wade Wilson / Deadpool in the film.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nAfter directing the films Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), Anthony and Joe Russo expressed interest in directing a Secret Wars film based on the 1984–85 comic book crossover event written by Jim Shooter and the 2015–16 comic book storyline written by Jonathan Hickman. Both follow various Marvel characters who converge on the planet Battleworld. Infinity War and Endgame writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely said they would return to write such a film if the Russo brothers were directing it. At San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) in July 2022, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige announced the films Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. They were set to conclude \"The Multiverse Saga\", which covers Phases Four, Five, and Six of the MCU. The Kang Dynasty was inspired by a 2001–02 comic book storyline written by Kurt Busiek in which Kang the Conqueror travels through time to enslave humanity. Jonathan Majors was cast as Kang for several Phase Four projects, and was confirmed to be starring in both new Avengers films. Destin Daniel Cretton was hired to direct The Kang Dynasty, with Jeff Loveness writing the script, and Michael Waldron set to write Secret Wars.\nFollowing Majors's arrest in March 2023 and subsequent assault allegations, reports and speculation emerged about his future in the MCU. Loveness was no longer involved in the film by the start of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike in May, reportedly because he was closely associated with the Kang storyline and Marvel was \"moving away\" from that. In June, the release dates for The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars were pushed back to May 1, 2026, and May 7, 2027, respectively, in part due to the scripts not being ready before the strike. Cretton stepped down as director of The Kang Dynasty in November 2023, partially due to schedule delays, and Waldron was set to rewrite the film. The next month, Majors was fired by Disney and Marvel Studios after he was found guilty of harassment and reckless assault in the third degree. The studio had started referring to The Kang Dynasty internally as Avengers 5 by then. By February 2024, both Avengers 5 and Secret Wars were being rewritten to minimize Kang's role or remove him entirely following Majors's firing.\nShawn Levy became the studio's top choice to direct Avengers 5 by mid-March 2024, after he directed the MCU film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), but there were potential scheduling issues with his other projects. By that May, Marvel Studios had approached Robert Downey Jr.—who starred as Tony Stark / Iron Man in \"The Infinity Saga\", covering the MCU's Phases One, Two, and Three—about returning to the MCU to take on the new character of Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom. Downey said he would only return if the Russo brothers also returned as directors. After McFeely approached the Russos with an idea for the films that excited them, they entered early talks to direct both Avengers 5 and Secret Wars by mid-July. At SDCC at the end of the month, the Russos were confirmed to be directing the two films. They revealed that Avengers 5 was now titled Avengers: Doomsday, and both films would feature Downey as Doctor Doom. The Russos were producing the films through their production company AGBO, and McFeely had joined as writer for both films, working with Waldron. In March 2025, Marvel announced 26 cast members for the film alongside Downey. Many of those actors returned from previous MCU media, while some were reprising their roles from 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series. Downey, Marvel Studios, and Feige teased that there were more cast members to reveal. Feige said Doomsday would focus on the Avengers, Wakandans, Fantastic Four, Thunderbolts—revealed in Thunderbolts* (2025) to be the government-sanctioned New Avengers—and the \"original\" X-Men teaming up to face Doom.\nProduction designer Gavin Bocquet and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel reteamed with the Russo brothers after working on their television series Citadel (2023–present). Costume designer Judianna Makovsky returned from previous MCU films. The Russos said Doomsday and Secret Wars were being produced together in a similar way to Infinity War and Endgame, but they would not be filmed back-to-back like those films were. Principal photography for Doomsday began on April 28, 2025, at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England, under the working title Apple Pie 1. In May 2025, Disney delayed the release date to December 18, 2026, to allow more time for production to be completed. Location filming was taking place in Bahrain by the end of the month, and was also set to occur at Windsor Great Park in June and August. Filming is expected to last for approximately six months. Jeffrey Ford is editing the film after working on previous MCU media.\n\n\n== Music ==\nIn April 2024, Alan Silvestri indicated that he could be composing the music for an upcoming MCU project after previously doing so for Infinity War, Endgame, and other MCU films. That July, he was confirmed to be returning as the composer for both Doomsday and Secret Wars.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe Doomsday subtitle, the return of the Russo brothers, and the casting of Downey as Doctor Doom were all announced at Marvel Studios' SDCC panel in July 2024. The announcement involved multiple people dressed as Doom appearing on stage, including Downey, who unmasked himself to reveal his casting to the audience. Kat Bailey at IGN described the casting announcement as \"one of the most dramatic reveals in recent Marvel history\" and reported on mixed responses from fans, with some praising Downey's return while others thought it was a desperate move from Marvel Studios following the creative reshuffling caused by Majors's firing. Charles Pulliam-Moore of The Verge saw the casting as \"Marvel betting that it might be able to win audiences back with another massive cinematic event built around a person whose face and voice have long since become synonymous with Iron Man\". Other commentators also discussed the casting and mixed responses to it, including Collider's Collier Jennings who criticized the casting of a non-Romani actor considering the character's comic book heritage. The announcement led to speculation about whether Downey would be playing an alternate universe variant of Tony Stark / Iron Man or if his recasting would be ignored in the film's story.\nCoinciding with the start of production in March 2025, Marvel aired a nearly five-and-a-half-hour-long livestream showing a line of director's chairs with cast member names on them. A new chair was revealed approximately every 12 minutes, accompanied by music from a relevant previous Marvel project. After revealing 26 cast members, the livestream ended with an appearance by Downey and a rendition of Silvestri's Avengers theme. The livestream saw around 100,000 concurrent viewers on YouTube, and an hour-over-hour audience growth, to become the most viewed cross-platform livestream stunt. It became the second-most trending video on YouTube with 275 million views in its first 24 hours, surpassing past livestreams for Marvel's red carpet premieres. The livestream also accumulated 3.1 million mentions across social media, which is five times higher than the \"social volume\" of the first trailer for Deadpool & Wolverine. It garnered 55 distinct trending terms on X (formerly Twitter), with the hashtag \"AvengersDoomsday\" the top trending topic on the site for over seven hours. Numerous Internet memes were also generated with each cast announcement. Anthony D'Alessandro of Deadline Hollywood described the stunt as a \"pop cultural event\". Variety's Jordan Moreau and Brent Lang called the livestream a \"slow-burn\" and likened it to the release date reveal for the seventh season of Game of Thrones in 2017, which saw a block of ice melt to reveal the date; both stunts were \"mocked for their pace\". Austen Goslin of Polygon, who was concerned about the large cast that was announced, described the livestream as \"agonizingly slow [but] exceedingly fun\". He enjoyed checking the stream for each new reveal and then seeing responses on social media. James Whitbrook of Gizmodo said the number of viewers the livestream had \"speaks to the studio's ability to maintain much of that grip it's had on pop culture over the past almost 20 years now\". Based on the cast members announced in the livestream, Devin Meenan of /Film believed the film could be adapting elements from the 2012 comic book crossover event \"Avengers vs. X-Men\" written by Bendis, Matt Fraction, Jason Aaron, Ed Brubaker, and Hickman. He also felt elements of the 2010 limited series Doomwar, written by Jonathan Maberry, could be included. That comic depicts Doctor Doom invading Wakanda and features the X-Men.\nThe Russo brothers and Rudd introduced footage from the film at Destination D23 in late August 2025.\n\n\n== Release ==\nAvengers: Doomsday is scheduled to be released in the United States on December 18, 2026. It was originally scheduled for release on May 2, 2025, but was delayed to May 1, 2026, in part due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, followed by another delay to the December 2026 release to allow more time for production to be completed. It will be part of Phase Six of the MCU.\n\n\n== Sequel ==\n\nA sequel, titled Avengers: Secret Wars, is scheduled to be released on December 17, 2027. It is also being written by Waldron and McFeely, and directed by the Russo brothers. The film will conclude Phase Six of the MCU.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website  at Marvel.com\nAvengers: Doomsday at IMDb",

        "title": "Pedro Pascal",
        "content": "José Pedro Balmaceda Pascal (Spanish: [xoˈse ˈpeðɾo βalmaˈseða pasˈkal]; born April 2, 1975) is a Chilean and American actor. After nearly two decades of taking small roles on stage and television, Pascal had his breakout role as Oberyn Martell in the fourth season of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones (2014). He gained further prominence with his portrayal of Javier Peña in the Netflix crime series Narcos (2015–2017). He went on to appear in the films The Great Wall (2016), Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017), The Equalizer 2 (2018), and Triple Frontier (2019).\nPascal's leading roles as Din Djarin in the Disney+ science fiction series The Mandalorian (2019–2023) and Joel Miller in the HBO post-apocalyptic drama series The Last of Us (2023–present) propelled him to international stardom, earning him a reputation for portraying adoptive father figures. For the latter role, he received numerous accolades, including a Screen Actors Guild Award and a nomination for a Golden Globe Award and two Primetime Emmy Awards. He also portrayed parental characters in We Can Be Heroes (2020), Strange Way of Life (2023), The Wild Robot (2024), and The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025). Pascal has also starred in the films Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) and Gladiator II (2024).\nActive in theatre since 1999, he made his Broadway debut as Edmund in a 2019 adaptation of King Lear. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2023.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJosé Pedro Balmaceda Pascal was born on April 2, 1975, in Santiago, Chile to child psychologist Verónica Pascal Ureta and fertility doctor José Balmaceda Riera, a member of the Castilian-Basque aristocracy. His paternal grandmother was born in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. He has an older sister named Javiera, a younger brother named Nicolás, and a younger sister named Lux, who is an actress and transgender activist. Pascal's mother was the cousin of Andrés Pascal Allende, the nephew of socialist Chilean president Salvador Allende (through his sister Laura). Pascal Allende was an early leader of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, a militant far-left organization.\nTwo years before Pascal's birth, the democratically elected socialist government of Salvador Allende was overthrown by General Augusto Pinochet, leading to the country becoming a military dictatorship. Both of Pascal's parents were listed as enemies of the state by the Pinochet regime and the family eventually fled Chile when he was nine months old, after seeking refuge in the Venezuelan embassy in Santiago for six months.\nThe family later received political asylum in Denmark before settling in the United States, where Pascal was raised in San Antonio, Texas, until they relocated to Orange County, California, when he was eleven years old. By the time he was eight years old, his family regularly visited Chile to see his 34 cousins. His parents returned to Chile in 1995 after his father Dr. José P. Balmaceda was accused of stealing fertility patients' eggs and embryos and implanting them in other women without their knowledge and consent.\nHe pursued acting at the Orange County School of the Arts and graduated in 1993, before attending New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he graduated in 1997. After his mother's death, he began using his maternal surname professionally as a tribute to her and because he felt that Americans had difficulty pronouncing his paternal surname, Balmaceda.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1999–2013: Early work ===\n\nEarly in his career, Pascal appeared in several television series, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, NYPD Blue, The Good Wife, Nurse Jackie, and Homeland. Pascal experienced hard times during that point in his career; besides working in small acting and theatre roles, he took jobs waiting at restaurants. Pascal admitted that he was fired \"often, upwards of, I don't know, maybe close to 10 times\". In times of extreme hardship, Pascal's close friend Sarah Paulson would give him her per diem money \"so that he could have money to feed himself.\" At a point when he found difficulty in affording medical care, only having less than seven dollars in his bank account, he received a residual check from his role in Buffy, which helped him to restabilize his finances and allowed him to continue pursuing acting.\nPascal is a member of New York City's LAByrinth Theater Company. He received the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award and Garland Award for his role in the International City Theater production of Orphans, and has performed in classical and contemporary works. in 2005, Pascal made his feature film debut in Julia Solomonoff's Sisters. For Pascal's role, Solomonoff was looking for candidates with strong English-language skills. In addition to meeting this requirement, Pascal (then credited as Balmaceda) was found to be \"someone with a very special face, very photogenic, with a kind of mystery\" by Solomonoff. In 2010, he wrote a play, directed by Sarah Silverman, Flaca Loves Bone, about four siblings who meet in a snowy wood to uncover a family secret. Also in 2010, Pascal made his directorial debut with Killing Play, written by David Anzuelo, at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater. He also directed underneathmybed and Yosemite there. He was cast in the pilot for the 2011 Wonder Woman television adaptation as Ed Indelicato, Wonder Woman's liaison to the LAPD, but the show was not picked up.\n\n\n=== 2014–2018: Breakthrough and rise to fame ===\n\nIn 2014, Pascal portrayed the character Oberyn Martell in the fourth season of HBO's critically acclaimed television series Game of Thrones. The season aired from April 6 to June 15, 2014, and Pascal's performance as the passionate and vengeful Dornish prince garnered significant praise from both critics and audiences, with numerous publications, including CNET, Collider, The Mary Sue, Time, and Esquire naming Martell as one of the best characters in the show. The Los Angeles Times praised him as a sex symbol in the role, calling it \"the real tipping point in his career\"; MovieWeb assessed that his career \"skyrocket[ed]\" after playing Martell. Pascal stated that he was a huge fan of the show before being cast as Oberyn and was ecstatic to join. As part of the ensemble, he has received a Screen Actors Guild Awards nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.\nIn 2015, Pascal portrayed the vampire Max in Bloodsucking Bastards. In April, Pascal co-starred with Heidi Klum in the music video for Sia's \"Fire Meet Gasoline\". In August, Pascal gained further recognition for his portrayal as Javier Peña, based on a real-life DEA agent, in the popular Netflix crime drama series Narcos. The show's two first seasons depict the rise and fall of the infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar and the subsequent Medellín Cartel, as the show's focus shifted to the Cali Cartel for its third and final season, Pascal took on the role of both lead actor and narrator.\nIn 2016, he portrayed mercenary Pero Tovar in the fantasy action film The Great Wall, alongside Matt Damon, and directed by Zhang Yimou. Set against the backdrop of the Great Wall of China, the film follows European mercenaries who become embroiled in a battle against ancient creatures threatening humanity. Despite the film's visually stunning production and ambitious scope, it received mixed reviews for its narrative and character development. Filmed on location in Qingdao, China. Pascal has voiced his admiration for Zhang, whom he had been a fan of during his youth.\n\nIn 2017, Pascal portrayed the charismatic and skilled operative within the Statesman organization, Jack Daniels, also known as Agent Whiskey, in Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Golden Circle. Writing for Collider, Chris Sasaguay called his character \"one cool cowboy\", observing his \"genuine love for getting into a cutthroat brawl\", and praising the \"playful side that comes so easily to Pascal [...] which isn't lost in playing Whiskey, turning him into a worthy new character to stand beside the Kingsman agents\".\nIn 2018, he starred as Dave York, the main antagonist, against Denzel Washington in the thriller sequel film The Equalizer 2. In Prospect, Pascal portrayed the character Ezra, a seasoned and enigmatic prospector navigating a dangerous alien moon in search of valuable resources. CNET's \nMonisha Ravisetti was \"delightfully surprised when Pedro Pascal showed up in a burnt orange spacesuit\", and Dais Johnston retroactively compared the role to Pascal's future characters in The Mandalorian and The Last of Us, writing for Inverse, \"Pedro Pascal plays a gruff man who only looks out for himself until a child softens his heart\". In 2018's If Beale Street Could Talk, directed by Barry Jenkins and based on James Baldwin's novel, Pascal made a cameo appearance as Pietro Alvarez, a frivolous yet crucial character who ultimately reveals a compassionate and empathetic side.\n\n\n=== 2019–present: Worldwide recognition ===\nIn February 2019, Pascal made his Broadway debut in an adaptation of King Lear with Glenda Jackson and Ruth Wilson, where he took on the role of Edmund, the cunning and ambitious illegitimate son of the Earl of Gloucester. Since 2019, Pascal has portrayed the title role in The Mandalorian, the first live-action Star Wars television series, which debuted on Disney+, the show follows the adventures of a lone bounty hunter in the outer reaches of the galaxy. The role brought Pascal much wider recognition, and would later help establish him for his portrayals of father figures. The same year, he starred as Francisco \"Catfish\" Morales in the Netflix heist drama Triple Frontier, in which he portrays a helicopter pilot.\n\nIn 2020, he portrayed Maxwell Lord in the DC Extended Universe film Wonder Woman 1984, directed by Patty Jenkins. Following delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was released to theaters and HBO Max in December 2020.  The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw called Pascal's character \"a version of Norman Vincent Peale, the positive-thinking guru who was such an influence on presidents Nixon and Trump\". The New York Times and the BBC both thought that Pascal was miscast for the role. In the film We Can Be Heroes, he played Marcus Moreno. Screen Rant commented on the paternal aspect of the character, \"It certainly should be the case that Pascal's fatherly role in a children's movie portrays him as a truly loving and caring father, and that's exactly what [the character] does\".\nIn early 2021, a video from a 2020 virtual play reading of I, My Ruination surfaced on multiple social media platforms of Pascal laughing hysterically then transitioning smoothly into crying. The video quickly became an internet meme, often being paired with the Beach House song \"Space Song\" to display themes of tragedy on social media.\nIn 2022, Pascal co-starred with Nicolas Cage in the action comedy film The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. His performance was widely praised by critics. A scene in which Pascal's character looks at a gruff and irritated Cage with a grin on his face while driving under the influence of LSD would spawn another internet meme on TikTok. It is commonly used humorously when two parties are in stark disagreement or conflict with each other over a topic in an exaggeratedly emotional fashion, and is paired with the 1969 Mama Cass song \"Make Your Own Kind of Music\". Pascal also appeared in The Bubble, Judd Apatow's satirical comedy exploring celebrity culture amidst the pandemic. Reviewing the film for The A.V. Club, Luke Y. Thompson called Pascal's character Dieter Bravo a \"womanizer\", and noted that the character's \"fake 'ethnic' accent skewers what he likely has to endure regularly\". Shot during the COVID-19 pandemic, the film portrays the protocols adopted during filming due to the event as \"purposely a little off-center\".  He starred in Miu Miu's Women's Tales series short film, directed by Janicza Bravo, titled House Comes With a Bird. In November, he signed with Creative Artists Agency.\nIn 2023, Pascal starred in HBO's highly anticipated television adaptation, The Last of Us, based on the critically acclaimed 2013 video game, created by Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann. He took on the role of Joel Miller, a hardened survivor in a post-apocalyptic world, tasked with protecting a young girl named Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey. Pascal reportedly received $600,000 per episode. Empire's John Nugent and /Film's Valerie Ettenhofer praised Pascal's performance as the best of his career, citing his ability to portray nuance and rare vulnerability. Druckmann called Ramsey and Pascal's chemistry \"a joy.\" The characterization of the paternal dynamic in the role and the similarity of his character in The Mandalorian earned Pascal international recognition for portraying adoptive father figures. This massive surge in popularity led him to become dubbed \"daddy\" in internet culture. Around this time, Pascal became a prominent figure in meme culture, with several memes of him achieving viral status, including a meme from a clip of Pascal eating a sandwich during a guest episode of LADbible's \"Snack Wars\" YouTube series in which he appeared with The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau. Several popular memes of Pascal were derived from The Last of Us episode \"Kin\", such as one from a scene where Joel is portrayed as having a panic attack, and others relating to his character's tendency to lean on furniture throughout the episode due to being in a constant state of fear.\n\nIn February 2023, he hosted a Saturday Night Live episode, with Coldplay as the musical guest. In April, he was added to the cast of Ethan Coen's 2024 film Drive-Away Dolls, and Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In May, he co-starred in the short film Strange Way of Life alongside Ethan Hawke, directed by Pedro Almodóvar. He plays Silva, who reunites with Hawke's Jake in the two's older age. Pascal previously expressed his admiration for and desire to work with Almodóvar. Screen Rant noted it as another example of Pascal taking a role with the \"dad\" archetype. In June, Pascal was named by Carnegie Corporation of New York as an honoree of the Great Immigrants Award. In July, Pascal made history as the first Latino to receive three nominations in the same year for the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards. The nominations included Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal in The Last of Us, Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his guest-hosting role in an episode of Saturday Night Live, and Outstanding Narrator for his narration in Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World.\nIn January 2024, he starred in Freaky Tales, directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.  In June, musician Omar Apollo released his second studio album, God Said No, where Pascal features on the penultimate track, \"Pedro\", where he contributes a monologue about his heart being \"shattered by something\". In the animated feature The Wild Robot, he portrayed Fink, a fox who plays a parental role to a goose named Brightbill alongside Lupita Nyong'o's robot Roz. He next starred in Gladiator II, the sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000). At the end of 2024, he was polled as Grindr's hottest man of the year.\nIn 2025, Pascal acted in Celine Song's Materialists, Ari Aster's Eddington, and portrayed Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film The Fantastic Four: First Steps, a role he is set to reprise in Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPascal is fluent in both English and Spanish. \nHis sister, Javiera Balmaceda, is a producer at Amazon MGM Studios.\nHe developed a close friendship with actress Sarah Paulson soon after moving to New York City in 1993. Pascal is also close friends with Oscar Isaac, as the two actors met while appearing in a 2005 off-Broadway production of Beauty of the Father. Isaac and Pascal would later appear together in the 2019 film Triple Frontier. While filming The Last of Us, he became close friends with Bella Ramsey, calling himself and Ramsey \"linked souls\".\nPascal identifies as an agnostic and a progressive liberal. He is an advocate of LGBTQ+ rights and was supportive of his sister Lux Pascal when she came out as transgender. Lux said, \"He has been an important part of this. He is also an artist and has been a guide. He was one of the first to give me the things that formed my identity.\" In April 2025, Pascal condemned author J. K. Rowling, calling her a \"heinous loser\" in an Instagram comment, after she celebrated the For Women Scotland Ltd v The Scottish Ministers ruling, which allowed for the exclusion of trans women from \"single-sex services for women\".\nOn Christmas Eve 2023, Pascal called for a ceasefire in the Gaza war and urged donations to Doctors Without Borders. On March 1, 2025, Pascal posted in support of Ukraine on Instagram, writing, \"Stay on the right side of history. Glory to Ukraine\", after U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance's public criticisms of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In May 2025, Pascal signed an open letter criticizing the film industry's \"passivity\" during the ongoing Gaza genocide.\n\n\n== Acting credits and accolades ==\n\nBeginning his career in 1996, Pascal's highest rated film and television projects, according to the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, include: The Uninvited (2024), The Last of Us (2023–present), If Beale Street Could Talk (2018), Calls (2021), The Good Wife (2009–2011), The Mandalorian (2019–2023), Prospect (2018), Narcos (2015–2017), Game of Thrones (2014), and Graceland (2013–2014).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPedro Pascal at IMDb",

Signed to WWE since 2001, he is a record 17-time world champion, holding the most recognized world title reigns in the promotion's history, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. Cena has also starred in numerous films and TV shows, including The Marine (2006), Bumblebee (2018), and F9 (2021), as well as currently starring in the TV series Peacemaker (2022–present) as the eponymous lead.\nOriginally pursuing a bodybuilding career, Cena began wrestling in 1999 and signed with WWE in 2001 to its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). After debuting on the main roster on SmackDown! in 2002, he rose to prominence as a brash, villainous rapper before becoming the company's top heroic figure from the mid-2000s to the mid-2010s. From 2018 he began working a reduced schedule. His run as a face from 2003 to 2025 was the longest continuous portrayal of a heroic character in WWE history. Cena has headlined multiple major WWE pay-per-views, including its flagship event, WrestleMania, six times (22, 23, 27, 28, 29, and 41 – Night 2). He has held numerous championships and accomplishments, including 14 WWE Championships and 3 World Heavyweight Championships. He is also a two-time Royal Rumble and one-time Money in the Bank winner. His full-time career received mixed critical and audience reception, with praise for his character work and promotional skills but criticism for his perceived over-representation and on-screen dominance relative to other wrestlers. In contrast, his later career has been more positively received.\nOutside of his wrestling career, Cena has acted in both comedies and action films, receiving praise for his roles in Trainwreck, Blockers, and The Suicide Squad.

He also worked in the store area of Gold's Gym for $6 an hour.\n\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n\n\n=== Ultimate Pro Wrestling (1999–2001) ===\n\nIn 1998, Cena moved to California to train for professional wrestling at Ultimate Pro Wrestling's (UPW) Ultimate University, operated by Rick Bassman.

After a heel turn, he began feuding with Billy Kidman and adopted a rapper persona inspired by a backstage freestyle overheard by Stephanie McMahon and Paul Heyman. Debuting the \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" character, Cena began performing freestyle raps in promos and wore jerseys and hats as part of his gimmick,  along with the slogan \"Word Life\".  He was briefly paired with enforcer B-2 (Bull Buchanan) and then Red Dogg until he was sent to the Raw brand in February.\nAt the 2003 Royal Rumble, Cena made his first appearance in the match but was eliminated by The Undertaker. He then entered a number-one contender tournament for the WWE Championship, defeating  Eddie Guerrero, The Undertaker and Chris Benoit before losing to champion Brock Lesnar at Backlash. Cena continued high-profile feuds with The Undertaker and Kurt Angle, eventually turning face after joining Angle's team at Survivor Series in November\n\n\n==== Rise to superstardom (2004–2005) ====\n\nAt the 2004 Royal Rumble, Cena was eliminated by Big Show and failed to earn a WWE Championship match at No Way Out.

He retained the title at Judgment Day and The Great American Bash before being stripped of it on the July 8 of SmackDown! after accidentally knocking over General Manager Kurt Angle.\nCena regained the title by defeating Booker T in a best of five series that concluded at No Mercy on October 3, but lost it days later to Carlito Caribbean Cool on SmackDown!. Their storyline escalated when Cena was (kayfabe) stabbed in a nightclub by Carlito's bodyguard Jesús, an angle used to explain his absence while filming The Marine. Cena returned at Survivor Series on November 14 and regained the title on the November 18 episode of SmackDown!, then defeated Jesús in a street fight at Armageddon on December 12.\nAt the 2005 Royal Rumble, Cena and Batista were the final two participants and were eliminated simultaneously by one-another. After a restart, Batista won. Cena earned a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania 21 by defeating Kurt Angle at No Way Out, beginning a feud with champion John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL). Although he lost his United States Championship to Orlando Jordan in March, Cena defeated JBL at WrestleMania to win his first WWE Championship. He introduced a customized spinner belt and defeated JBL again in an \"I Quit\" match at Judgment Day.\nCena was drafted to Raw on June 6, 2005, becoming the first pick in that year's draft lottery. He began a feud with General Manager Eric Bischoff, who opposed Cena's refusal to participate in fighting the ECW roster at One Night Stand. At Vengeance, Cena retained his title in a triple threat match against Christian and Chris Jericho. Bischoff backed Jericho as his chosen challenger, but Cena retained his championship at SummerSlam and defeated Jericho again in a You're Fired match on the August 22 episode of Raw. Kurt Angle subsequently replaced Jericho as Bischoff's hand-picked contender. Over the next few months, Cena lost to Angle by disqualification at Unforgiven, pinned Shawn Michaels at Taboo Tuesday in a triple threat match involving Angle, and pinned Angle at Survivor Series.  During this feud, Cena added a submission finisher, the STFU, in preparation for a triple threat submission match against Angle and Chris Masters on the November 28 episode of Raw.\n\n\n==== WWE Champion (2006–2007) ====\n\nCena retained the WWE Championship in the Elimination Chamber at New Year's Revolution, but immediately lost it to Edge, who cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. Cena regained the title at the Royal Rumble and retained it against Triple H at WrestleMania 22, Cena's first WrestleMania headlining match. Cena lost the title a few months later to Rob Van Dam at ECW One Night Stand due to Edge's interference, in a match where the crowd was notably hostile to Cena. Edge later won the title from Van Dam on the July 3 episode of Raw, leading to a lengthy feud that ended with Cena defeating him in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match at Unforgiven in September to reclaim the championship. Cena returned with his version of the spinner title belt on the next night's Raw.\nCena was involved in a Champion of Champions match at Cyber Sunday against Big Show and King Booker. Kevin Federline interfered in the match, leading to the duo feuding. In the new year, Federline pinned Cena on the January 1, 2007 episode of Raw with an assist from Umaga. Cena then defended his championship against Umaga twice at New Year's Revolution and in a Last Man Standing match at the Royal Rumble.\nThe night afterwards on Raw, Cena teamed with Shawn Michaels to win the World Tag Team Championship from Rated-RKO before defeating Michaels at WrestleMania 23 to retain the WWE title.  Michaels would turn on Cena the night after, costing the pair the tag titles in a battle royal. In the summer Cena also defeated The Great Khali at Judgment Day by submission and at One Night Stand by pinfall and Bobby Lashley, King Booker, Mick Foley and Randy Orton in a five-pack challenge at Vengeance: Night of Champions, and against Lashley at The Great American Bash in subsequent defenses and began a feud with Randy Orton, against him retaining the title at SummerSlam and Unforgiven.\nOn the October 1 episode of Raw, Cena suffered a legitimate torn pectoral muscle during a match against Mr. Kennedy and was sidelined indefinitely. He was stripped of the WWE Championship the following night, ending his 380-day reign. Cena underwent surgery for his injury at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion and further world championship reigns (2008–2010) ====\nAt the 2008 Royal Rumble, Cena made a surprise return as the final participant of the Royal Rumble match, which he won by last eliminating Triple H. Rather than wait for WrestleMania XXIV he used his title shot against WWE Champion Randy Orton at No Way Out but won by disqualification, thus not capturing the title. Despite this, Cena was later added to the WrestleMania XXIV title match, making it a triple threat, but was pinned by Orton. Following WrestleMania Cena would feud with JBL, defeating him at Judgment Day and One Night Stand, before losing to him in a New York City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash.\nIn August, Cena and Batista briefly won the World Tag Team Championship for a week.  At SummerSlam, he suffered a legitimate neck injury  in a loss to Batista, sidelining him until his return at Survivor Series following surgery, where he defeated Chris Jericho to win his first World Heavyweight Championship. While retaining the title against Jericho at Armageddon  and against JBL at the Royal Rumble, Cena lost the title to Edge at No Way Out in an Elimination Chamber match. Cena regained the title at WrestleMania 25 in a triple threat match involving Big Show but lost it back to Edge at Backlash. He then defeated Big Show at Judgment Day and Extreme Rules, and ended a brief feud with The Miz at The Bash.\nCena failed to win the WWE Championship at Night of Champions and SummerSlam, but captured the title at Breaking Point by defeating WWE champion Orton in an \"I Quit\" match. Cena would further trade the championship with Orton several times over the year, losing it to Orton a month later at Hell in a Cell, and regaining it at Bragging Rights. Cena would hold onto the championship for two months before losing it to Sheamus at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in a tables match.\n\nIn 2010, after being eliminated by a surprise-returning Edge at the Royal Rumble, Cena regained the WWE Championship at Elimination Chamber but lost it moments later to Batista in an impromptu match. Cena defeated Batista to regain the title at WrestleMania XXVI, and  retained the title in subsequent matches at Extreme Rules and Over the Limit, ending their feud.\n\n\n==== Storyline with The Nexus (2010–2011) ====\n\nOn the June 7 episode of Raw, during a match against CM Punk, Cena was attacked by all eight former contestants of the first season of NXT, with Wade Barrett as their leader. This group, later referring to itself as The Nexus, made Cena lose the WWE Championship to Sheamus at Fatal 4-Way on June 20, as well as their steel cage match on July 18 at Money in the Bank. Cena formed an alliance with Edge, Chris Jericho, John Morrison, R-Truth, Bret Hart and former Nexus member Daniel Bryan to defeat The Nexus at SummerSlam on August 15. At Night of Champions on September 19, Cena was eliminated by Barrett in a six-pack challenge elimination match for the championship.\nAt Hell in a Cell on October 3, Cena faced Barrett with the stipulations that if he were to lose, he would join The Nexus, and if he were to win, The Nexus would disband. Cena lost to Barrett and reluctantly joined The Nexus. On October 24, Cena and fellow Nexus member David Otunga defeated Rhodes and Drew McIntyre to win the WWE Tag Team Championship at Bragging Rights. Later that night, he was forced to help Barrett defeat Orton in a WWE Championship match; Barrett won by disqualification, but not the title. The next night on Raw, Cena and Otunga lost the titles to fellow Nexus members Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel when Barrett ordered Otunga to lie down and lose the titles.\nAt Survivor Series on November 21, Cena officiated another WWE Championship match between Barrett and Orton; per stipulation, if Barrett did not win the championship, Cena would be \"fired\" from the WWE. Cena was fired (kayfabe) after Orton retained against Barrett. The next night on Raw, Cena gave a farewell speech before again costing Barrett the title by interfering in his rematch with Orton. A week later, Cena invaded Raw, first as a spectator, but then attacked members of the Nexus, explaining he would still take them down one by one despite not being employed. On the December 13 episode of Raw, Cena was rehired by Barrett in exchange that he would face him on December 19 at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in a chairs match, which Cena won.\n\nOn the January 17, 2011 episode of Raw, Cena faced CM Punk, who had assumed leadership of The Nexus and renamed the stable as The New Nexus, in a match which ended in a no contest after Cena was attacked by the debuting Mason Ryan, who later joined The New Nexus. Cena competed in the Royal Rumble match on January 30, which saw Cena eliminate most of the members of The New Nexus, ending their feud. He was eliminated by WWE Champion The Miz, who was not part of the match. Cena won the titular match at Elimination Chamber on February 20 to face The Miz at WrestleMania XXVII for the WWE Championship.\n\n\n==== Feuds with The Rock and CM Punk (2011–2013) ====\n\nThe next night on Raw, Cena replied in rap form to comments made by The Rock the previous week, as he returned as the announced guest host of WrestleMania. That night, Cena and The Miz defeated Slater and Gabriel to become WWE Tag Team Champions, but their rematch clause was immediately invoked and they lost the titles after The Miz attacked Cena. After weeks of insults, Cena and The Rock finally met on the March 28 episode of Raw, where, after a verbal confrontation and brief attack by The Miz and Alex Riley, Cena attacked The Rock with the Attitude Adjustment. At WrestleMania on April 3, Cena and The Miz fought to a double countout, but The Rock restarted the match and performed a Rock Bottom on Cena, allowing The Miz to retain the title. The next night on Raw, Cena, in response to The Rock \"screwing\" him out of the title, agreed to face him in the main event of WrestleMania XXVIII, marking the first WrestleMania match set up one year in advance.\nAt Extreme Rules on May 1, Cena defeated The Miz and Morrison in a triple threat steel cage match to become WWE Champion. Cena retained the title against The Miz on May 22 at Over the Limit in an \"I Quit\" match, and R-Truth on June 19 at Capitol Punishment. After CM Punk announced he was leaving the company due to his contract expiring after Money in the Bank on July 17, he defeated Cena for the WWE Championship, leaving with the title. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter awarded the match five stars, Cena's first and only five star match. On July 25, after Rey Mysterio won the title in a tournament, Cena challenged and defeated him for the title later that night, only to be interrupted by Punk, who also claimed to be champion. Cena lost to Punk at SummerSlam on August 14 in a championship unification match. At Night of Champions on September 18, Cena defeated Alberto Del Rio for his tenth WWE Championship, but lost it back to Del Rio at Hell in a Cell on October 2 in a triple threat Hell in a Cell match also involving Punk. Cena lost his rematch to Del Rio at Vengeance on October 23 in a Last Man Standing match due to interference by The Awesome Truth (The Miz and R-Truth). After weeks of them attacking Cena and employees, Cena was allowed to choose his partner to face them on November 20 at Survivor Series. He chose The Rock as his partner, and they defeated Miz and Truth; after the match, The Rock gave Cena a Rock Bottom.\n\nCena briefly feuded with Kane, who he fought to a double countout at Royal Rumble on January 29, 2012, and defeated in an Ambulance match on February 19 at Elimination Chamber. On March 19, Cena was involved in a three-car accident in Philadelphia, but suffered no severe injuries. At WrestleMania XXVIII on April 1, Cena lost to The Rock in the main event after attempting to hit the People's Elbow on The Rock, who countered with a Rock Bottom for the pinfall. \n\nThe following night on Raw SuperShow, Cena invited The Rock to the ring to congratulate him on his victory, however, his call was answered instead by the returning Brock Lesnar, who attacked Cena with an F-5. Raw and SmackDown General Manager John Laurinaitis revealed that he signed Lesnar to bring \"legitimacy\" to the WWE and for him to become its \"new face\". At Extreme Rules on April 29, Cena defeated Lesnar in an Extreme Rules match. At Over the Limit on May 20, Big Show helped Laurinaitis defeat Cena, but he was fired at No Way Out on June 17 after Cena defeated Big Show in a steel cage match with both their jobs on the line. Cena won the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match at Money in the Bank on July 15, earning a contract for a shot at the WWE Championship anytime within a year. At Raw 1000 on July 23, Cena cashed in his contract on Punk and won by disqualification after Big Show interfered, becoming the first person to cash in a Money in the Bank contract and not win a title. Cena failed to win the title from Punk in a triple threat match involving Big Show at SummerSlam on August 19, and fought him to a draw at Night of Champions on September 16. After being sidelined with a legitimate arm injury, Cena was pinned by Punk in a triple threat match involving Ryback at Survivor Series on November 18. He then feuded with Dolph Ziggler over an alleged relationship with AJ Lee and lost to Ziggler in a ladder match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 16 for his World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank contract, after AJ turned on Cena. Cena defeated Ziggler on the January 7 and 14 episodes of Raw despite interferences from AJ and Big E Langston, ending the feud.\nOn January 27, 2013, Cena won his second Royal Rumble match, announcing that he would pursue the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 29. At Elimination Chamber on February 17, Cena, Ryback and Sheamus lost to The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins). On the February 25 episode of Raw, Cena defeated Punk to retain his number one contendership to the WWE Championship. At WrestleMania on April 7, Cena defeated The Rock in their rematch to win his eleventh WWE Championship. Cena then began a rivalry with Ryback and suffered a legitimate achilles tendon injury, but retained the title in a Last Man Standing match (which ended in a no contest) at Extreme Rules on May 19 and a Three Stages of Hell match on June 16 at Payback. He defeated Mark Henry via submission to retain the title on July 14 at Money in the Bank. At SummerSlam on August 18, Cena lost the WWE Championship to Daniel Bryan with Triple H as the special guest referee, ending his reign at 133 days. The following night on Raw, Cena announced he would undergo surgery for a triceps tear and would be out for four to six months.\n\n\n==== World championship pursuits and reigns (2013–2015) ====\nCena returned at Hell in a Cell on October 27, defeating Del Rio to win his third World Heavyweight Championship. He retained the title against Del Rio on November 24 at Survivor Series. Cena next challenged then-WWE Champion Randy Orton to unify their respective championships, leading to a Tables, Ladders and Chairs title unification match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 15, which Cena lost. Cena failed to win the now-unified WWE World Heavyweight Championship from Orton at Royal Rumble on January 26, 2014, and in the Elimination Chamber match at the titular event on February 23 after being distracted by The Wyatt Family.\n\nFollowing the event, Bray Wyatt accepted Cena's challenge for a match at WrestleMania XXX on April 6 to prove that Cena's heroic act was a façade characteristic of \"this era of lies\" and turn Cena into a \"monster\". At WrestleMania, Cena defeated Wyatt despite interference from Luke Harper and Erick Rowan. The feud continued based on the story that Wyatt was capturing Cena's fanbase, exemplified by Wyatt leading a children's choir to the ring on the April 28 episode of Raw, where they later donned sheep masks. At Extreme Rules on May 4, Wyatt defeated Cena in a steel cage match after repeated interference from the rest of the Wyatt Family members and a demonic child. At Payback on June 1, Cena defeated Wyatt in a Last Man Standing match after burying him under multiple equipment cases, ending their feud.\nAt Money in the Bank on June 29, Cena won the ladder match for the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship. He retained the title at Battleground on July 20 in a fatal four-way match against Orton, Kane and Reigns. At SummerSlam on August 17, Cena lost the title to Lesnar in a squash match after sixteen suplexes and two F-5s, ending his reign at 49 days. In their rematch at Night of Champions on September 21, he failed to regain the title after Rollins attacked him, causing a disqualification. At Hell in a Cell on October 26, Cena defeated Orton in a Hell in a Cell match to become the number one contender for the championship.\nThe next night on Raw, Cena rejected The Authority's offer to join forces, resulting in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination tag match between Team Cena (Cena, Ziggler, Rowan, Big Show and Ryback) and Team Authority (Rollins, Kane, Harper, Henry and Rusev) at Survivor Series on November 23. Big Show turned on Cena, causing his elimination, but Ziggler won the match for Team Cena with the interfering Sting's help. Per the stipulation, The Authority were stripped from power and only Cena could bring them back. At TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 14, Cena defeated Rollins in a tables match to retain his number one contendership to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and face Lesnar for the title at Royal Rumble. On the December 29 episode of Raw, Rollins and Big Show held guest host Edge hostage, forcing Cena to reinstate The Authority, who added Rollins to his title match and \"fired\" Ziggler, Ryback and Rowan for joining Team Cena. He won their jobs back by defeating Rollins, Big Show and Kane in a handicap match. At Royal Rumble on January 25, 2015, Cena was unsuccessful in capturing the title.\n\n\n==== United States Champion (2015–2016) ====\nCena then began feuding with United States Champion Rusev and failed to win the title at Fastlane on February 22, when he passed out from Rusev's submission, the Accolade, after Rusev hit Cena with a low blow following a distraction by his manager Lana. Cena challenged Rusev to a rematch, which was declined, and Stephanie McMahon decreed that Cena would not compete at WrestleMania 31 unless Rusev agreed to a rematch. On the March 9 episode of Raw, Cena attacked Rusev, refusing to release the STF submission hold, causing Lana to grant Cena the match. Cena defeated Rusev at WrestleMania on March 29 to win his fourth United States Championship, marking Rusev's first pinfall loss in the main roster. He issued weekly open challenges for the title, culminating in successful defenses against the likes of Dean Ambrose, Stardust, Bad News Barrett, Kane, Sami Zayn, Neville, Zack Ryder and Cesaro. He retained his title against Rusev in a Russian Chain match on April 26 at Extreme Rules, and an \"I Quit\" match on May 17 at Payback, ending their feud. The following night on Raw, Cena was attacked by then-NXT Champion Kevin Owens, setting up a Champion vs. Champion match at Elimination Chamber on May 31, which Owens won. Cena defeated Owens at Money in the Bank on June 14 and at Battleground on July 19 to retain the United States Championship and end their feud.\nCena resumed his feud with then-WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins, with Rollins refusing Cena's challenges for the title. On the July 27 episode of Raw, The Authority forced him to defend the title against Rollins, successfully doing so despite suffering a legitimate broken nose. At SummerSlam on August 23, Cena lost to Rollins in a \"Winner Takes All\" match for both the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and the United States Championship after guest host Jon Stewart attacked him with a steel chair, ending his reign at 147 days. He won his fifth United States Championship from Rollins on September 20 at Night of Champions (a record in the WWE ownership era of the title), defeating him to retain the title the next night on Raw and in a steel cage match on October 3 at WWE Live from Madison Square Garden. Cena also resumed his open challenges for the title, which he lost to the returning Alberto Del Rio at Hell in a Cell on October 25. He underwent shoulder surgery on January 7, sidelining him for an undisclosed length of time.\n\n\n==== Feud with AJ Styles (2016–2017) ====\nCena returned at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, helping The Rock fend off The Wyatt Family. Cena made his full return on the Memorial Day edition of Raw on May 30, four months earlier than had been expected for his type of injury. He was confronted by AJ Styles, who betrayed Cena when he joined his former The Club teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in attacking him. On June 19, at Money in the Bank, Cena lost to Styles after interference from Gallows and Anderson. At Battleground on July 24, Cena, Enzo Amore and Big Cass defeated The Club in a six-man tag team match after Cena pinned Styles. During the 2016 WWE draft on July 19, Cena was drafted to the SmackDown brand. At SummerSlam on August 21, Cena again lost to Styles. With Styles later winning the renamed WWE World Championship, Cena challenged him and Dean Ambrose in a triple threat match for the title on October 9 at No Mercy, but lost after being pinned by Styles, which came after Ambrose and Cena simultaneously made Styles submit, therefore restarting the match. Cena took a sabbatical from WWE to film American Grit season 2.\nOn January 29, 2017, Cena defeated Styles at Royal Rumble to win the WWE Championship and tie Ric Flair for the most recognized world title reigns at 16. He lost the title in an Elimination Chamber match at the titular event on February 12 to Bray Wyatt, and failed to regain it two nights later on SmackDown Live in a triple threat match also featuring Styles. Cena then began a feud with The Miz, with The Miz accusing Cena of being a hypocrite because of his movie commitments, while Cena accused The Miz of stealing other wrestlers' moves and personalities. The Miz's wife Maryse then slapped Cena before Cena and his girlfriend Nikki Bella sent The Miz and Maryse retreating. Cena and Bella defeated them in a mixed tag team match at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, after which Cena proposed marriage to Bella, which she accepted.\n\n\n==== Free agent (2017–2019) ====\n\nIn July 2017, WWE dubbed Cena a \"free agent\" during the Superstar Shake-up, meaning he could work for both the Raw and SmackDown brands. Cena defeated Rusev in a flag match at Battleground on July 23, Baron Corbin at SummerSlam on August 20, and lost to Roman Reigns on September 24 at No Mercy. Cena returned to SmackDown the next month after Commissioner Shane McMahon named him as the final member of Team SmackDown for the men's 5-on-5 elimination match against Team Raw at Survivor Series on November 19; Cena was eliminated by Kurt Angle and Team SmackDown was defeated.\nCena failed to win the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2018, an Elimination Chamber match to determine the number one contender for the Universal Championship on February 25 at the titular event, and a six-pack challenge for the WWE Championship on March 11 at Fastlane. On April 8, at WrestleMania 34, Cena was quickly defeated by The Undertaker. He defeated Triple H on April 27 at the Greatest Royal Rumble, and teamed with Bobby Lashley to defeat Elias and Owens at Super Show-Down on October 6. He was scheduled for a match at Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia on November 2, but refused to work the event following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nCena returned to WWE television on the January 1, 2019 episode of SmackDown, where he and Becky Lynch defeated Andrade Cien Almas and Zelina Vega in a mixed tag team match. On the January 14 episode of Raw, Cena lost to Finn Bálor in a fatal four-way match also involving Drew McIntyre and Corbin to determine the number one contender for the Universal Championship at Royal Rumble. Cena was scheduled to compete in the Royal Rumble on January 27, but was taken out due to an in-storyline ankle injury supposedly suffered during the match.\n\n\n==== Part-time performer (2019–2024) ====\nHe appeared at WrestleMania 35 on April 7 in his \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" persona and interrupted Elias' concert, performing his finisher on Elias (calling it by its original name of the F-U) after insulting him. On the July 22 episode of Raw titled Raw Reunion, he engaged in a rap battle with The Usos.\nCena returned to WWE again on the February 28, 2020 episode of SmackDown, seemingly announcing his retirement before he was confronted by \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt, who challenged him to a match at WrestleMania 36, which Cena accepted. On Night 2 of WrestleMania on April 5, rather than a traditional wrestling match, the two fought in a surreal cinematic-style match called a Firefly Fun House match, showcasing moments from Cena's and Wyatt's history. Wyatt ultimately defeated Cena, after which his motionless body vanished from the middle of the ring.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cena was unable to appear at WrestleMania 37, marking the first time he missed a WrestleMania in nearly 20 years, as he had wrestled or appeared at the event every year since his first appearance in 2003. At the time, Cena was in Canada filming the HBO Max series Peacemaker and couldn't travel to Tampa, Florida for WrestleMania 37 without facing a two-week quarantine, which would have shut down production on the series. He made his return to WWE programming at Money in the Bank on July 18, 2021, confronting Roman Reigns after the latter retained his Universal Championship against Edge in the main event. After initially being scheduled to face Finn Bálor for the title, Cena hijacked a contract signing on the July 30 episode of SmackDown so he would challenge Reigns at SummerSlam on August 21, where Cena failed to win the title.\nCena returned on the June 27, 2022 episode of Raw, which marked the 20th anniversary of his main roster in-ring debut. He cut a promo recalling all his memories and thanking the fans for their support, also making appearances backstage with The Street Profits, Ezekiel, Theory, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, and Omos. On the December 30 episode of SmackDown, Cena and Kevin Owens defeated The Bloodline's Reigns and Sami Zayn. On the March 6, 2023 episode of Raw, Cena accepted Theory's challenge for a United States Championship match at WrestleMania 39. On Night 1 of WrestleMania on April 1, Cena lost to Theory. At Money in the Bank on July 1, Cena made a surprise appearance and was confronted by Grayson Waller after Cena stated that WrestleMania should come to the United Kingdom. Waller then attacked Cena, who retaliated by hitting the Attitude Adjustment on Waller.\n\nAt Payback on September 2, Cena served as the host and special guest referee for the match between LA Knight and The Miz. On the September 15 episode of SmackDown, Cena was attacked on The Grayson Waller Effect by Jimmy Uso and his Bloodline partner Solo Sikoa, before AJ Styles saved Cena. They were set to sign a contract for a tag team match at Fastlane on October 7, but Styles was left unable to compete after a backstage assault from the Bloodline. Knight eventually signed a contract to join Cena in the match at Fastlane, which they won. Cena made his first appearance on WWE NXT on October 10, being in Carmelo Hayes' corner during Hayes' match against Bron Breakker. On the October 20 episode of SmackDown, Cena teased retirement before calling out anyone to face him, leading to Sikoa coming out and brawling with Cena, setting up a match between the two at Crown Jewel on November 4, which Cena lost after nine Samoan Spikes. On Night 2 of WrestleMania XL on April 7, 2024, Cena appeared during the main event between Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns to aide Rhodes and take out both Sikoa and Reigns with the Attitude Adjustment. Afterwards, The Rock appeared and performed a Rock Bottom on Cena. The next night on Raw, Cena competed in his first match on Raw since January 2019, where he teamed with Raw Tag Team Champions Awesome Truth (The Miz and R-Truth) to defeat Judgment Day members Finn Bálor, JD McDonagh, and Dominik Mysterio.\n\n\n==== Retirement tour (2024–present) ====\n\nCena made a surprise appearance at Money in the Bank on July 6, 2024, to announce his retirement from in-ring action at the end of 2025.\nAt the Raw premiere on Netflix on January 6, 2025, he announced that he would compete at the Royal Rumble on February 1 in the eponymous match, where he was the last man eliminated by Jey Uso. Cena won the Elimination Chamber match at the namesake event on March 1 by last eliminating CM Punk, tying Triple H's record for the most Elimination Chamber victories at four and earning an Undisputed WWE Championship match against Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41. After the match, Cena viciously attacked Rhodes and aligned himself with The Rock and Travis Scott, turning heel for the first time since 2003. In subsequent appearances, Cena criticized the fans for their treatment of him over the years, vowing to \"ruin\" wrestling and retire as champion. In the main event of Night 2 of WrestleMania 41 on April 20, Cena defeated Rhodes with help from Travis Scott to win the Undisputed WWE Championship, becoming a record 17-time world champion.\n\nOn the Raw after WrestleMania 41, Cena was attacked by Randy Orton, setting up a title match at Backlash on May 10, where Cena defeated Orton to retain the title after interference from R-Truth. At the post-show press conference, Cena hit R-Truth with an Attitude Adjustment when the latter interrupted him, setting up a match between them at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIX on May 24, which Cena won after a low blow. He later interfered in the main event between Jey Uso and Logan Paul for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Uso won with an assist from a returning Rhodes, setting up a tag team match between Cena and Paul against Uso and Rhodes at Money in the Bank on June 7, which Cena and Paul lost after interference from R-Truth. He lost to R-Truth via disqualification on the June 20 episode of SmackDown after hitting him with the title belt. At Night of Champions on June 28, Cena defeated CM Punk to retain the title after interference from Seth Rollins, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed.\nOn the August 1 episode of SmackDown, Cena reverted to being a face after being beaten up by the 2025 King of the Ring tournament winner Cody Rhodes, who made Cena sign the contract for a Street Fight for the title at SummerSlam after Cena had tried to back out of the match. On Night 2 of the event on August 3, Cena lost the title to Rhodes, and was subsequently confronted and attacked by a returning Brock Lesnar. On August 31 at Clash in Paris, Cena defeated Logan Paul.\n\n\n== Professional wrestling style and persona ==\n\n\n=== In-ring style ===\n\nCena's original gimmick, known as the \"Doctor of Thuganomics\", portrayed a white rapper who wore jerseys, backwards hats, and a chain with a padlock around his neck. First as \"The Prototype\", and later under his real name, Cena sometimes used underhanded tactics to score victories, occasionally using his chain as a weapon behind the referee's back. He often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media and the crowd. He also performed \"rap battles\", where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other. In 2006, shortly after his debut film, The Marine, his wrestling character shifted from that of a rapper to a young military upstart, wearing dog tags and cargo shorts to the ring and also performing a salute to the crowd. Cena said in a 2011 interview with WWE.com that \"every night when I do that salute, it's also a sign of respect to the men and women that don the uniform of the Armed Forces.\"\nDuring WWE's change from TV-14 to TV-PG in mid-2008, the name of Cena's finishing move, the \"FU\", was changed to the \"Attitude Adjustment\" and his finishing submission move, the \"STFU\", was renamed the \"STF\" to fit with WWE's new policies. During his career, he has been known for ending his matches with a sequence of moves, dubbed the \"Five Moves of Doom\". The moves typically go in the following order: two flying shoulder blocks, protobomb, \"Five Knuckle Shuffle\", and \"Attitude Adjustment\".\nCena has portrayed a heroic character throughout his WWE career, except for a villainous run from 2002 to 2003, and his recent heel turn at Elimination Chamber in 2025.  Despite the initial reception to his heel turn, the execution of his villainous character had negative reception. Cena himself labeled his heel work as a faliure. His signature ring gear includes jean shorts, sneakers, wristbands, and armbands. He also wears a variety of T-shirts and baseball caps, which commonly include one of his catchphrases: \"Never Give Up\", \"You Can't See Me\", \"Hustle, Loyalty, Respect\", and \"Respect. Earn it\". He has a history of returning from both real and scripted injuries much sooner than expected. ESPN reporter David Shoemaker said in April 2016, \"Never underestimate Cena's recuperative abilities. He's somewhere on the recovery scale between German platelet-rich plasma therapy and Deadpool\". Fellow wrestler Big Show said he felt most stable being lifted by Cena, despite Cena being over 200 lbs lighter and almost a foot shorter—a testament to Cena's functional strength.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nDuring his WWE career, Cena has used his attire in an attempt to reflect the most current fashions and styling within the hip hop culture that his character represents. Cena started out wearing \"throwback jerseys\" and Reebok pumps until WWE produced specific Cena merchandise which he began wearing. While Cena was a member of the SmackDown brand, one of his WWE-produced T-shirts bore the suggestive spoonerism \"Ruck Fules\". Whenever it appeared on television, the image was censored, not by the network, but by WWE to sell more shirts under the premise that it was \"too hot for TV\". He also wore a chain with a large padlock, occasionally using it as a weapon, until WrestleMania 21, when it was replaced with a chromed and diamond studded \"Chain Gang\" spinner medallion matching his spinner title belt.\nAround the time The Marine was released, Cena began wearing more military related attire, including camouflage shorts, dog tags, a Marine soldier cap, and a WWE produced shirt with the legend \"Chain Gang Assault Battalion\". Shortly after WrestleMania 23, when promotion for The Marine ended, the military attire diminished and was replaced with apparel bearing his new slogan \"American Made Muscle\" along with denim shorts, not seen since he was a member of the SmackDown roster. He then wore shirts that promoted Cenation and his trademark line \"You Can't See Me\".\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nCena has been called the greatest professional wrestler of all time by his peers Kurt Angle, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, and veteran industry personality Paul Heyman. Timothy Bella of The New York Times described Cena as \"perhaps the last of the monocultural, crossover stars, following the likes of Hulk Hogan, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin and the Rock.\" WWE chairman Vince McMahon said he regarded Cena as the WWE's Babe Ruth. Bleacher Report named Cena one of the 10 greatest WWE wrestlers of all time. Shawn Michaels's one hour long match on WWE Raw against Cena is touted as one of the best matches in history, and Michaels said that after a fortnight WWE tour in the United Kingdom, he did not want to do the match with anyone else other than him.\nIn 2012, WrestleMania XXVIII, headlined by the John Cena vs. The Rock main event, became the highest drawing event in WWE history with 1,217,000 buys. The event held the record for the highest grossing live event in WWE history as of 2012, grossing $8.9 million.\n\n\n== Acting career ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nWWE Studios, a division of WWE which produces and finances motion pictures, produced Cena's first movie—The Marine, which was distributed theatrically by 20th Century Fox America beginning on October 13, 2006. In its first week, the film made approximately US$7 million at the United States box office. After ten weeks in theaters, the film grossed $18.7 million. Once the film was released on DVD, it fared better, making $30 million in rentals in the first twelve weeks.\n\nHis second film, also produced by WWE Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox was 12 Rounds. Filming began on February 25, 2008, in New Orleans; the film was released on March 27, 2009.\nCena co-starred in his third film produced by WWE Studios, titled Legendary, which was played in selected theaters beginning on September 10, 2010, for a limited time. It was released on DVD on September 28. That same year, Cena starred in the children's film Fred: The Movie, a film based on Lucas Cruikshank's YouTube videos of the same name, where he plays Fred's imaginary father. The movie was first aired on Nickelodeon in September 2010.\nIn 2015, Cena made appearances in the comedy films Trainwreck, Sisters and a cameo in Daddy's Home. In 2017, Cena starred in the war drama The Wall and lent his voice for the animated films Surf's Up 2: WaveMania and Ferdinand. He also appeared in Daddy's Home 2, reprising his role in a larger capacity than the 2015 film. In 2018, Cena starred in the comedy Blockers and had a leading role in the Transformers spin-off prequel, Bumblebee. In 2019, he starred in Playing with Fire, playing the role of smokejumper superintendent Jake Carson. In 2020, he voiced Yoshi, a polar bear, in the adventure comedy film Dolittle.\nIn 2019, Cena was cast in Justin Lin's F9, playing Jakob Toretto, the brother of Vin Diesel's character Dominic Toretto. During the film's promotional tour in 2021, Cena referred to Taiwan as \"a country\". He subsequently posted an apology on social media as China considers Taiwan a part of China.\nCena also was cast as Christopher Smith / Peacemaker in James Gunn's The Suicide Squad, a role originally intended for Dave Bautista. In 2023, he reprised his role as Jakob Toretto in Fast X, which premiered in theaters on May 19. He was also the voice of Rocksteady in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which was released on August 2.\n\n\n=== Guest appearances ===\nBefore his WWE debut, Cena made an appearance on the webcast Go Sick as Bruebaker, an angry, cursing wrestler in 2001.\nDuring his WWE career, Cena appeared on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! three times. He has also appeared on morning radio shows including the CBS and XM versions of Opie and Anthony as part of their \"walkover\" on October 10, 2006. Other appearances have included NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Fuse's Celebrity Playlist, Fox Sports Net's The Best Damn Sports Show Period, FOX's MADtv, G4's Training Camp (with Shelton Benjamin), and two appearances on MTV's Punk'd (August 2006 and May 2007), as the victim of a practical joke. He also served as a co-presenter with Hulk Hogan at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards, as a guest judge during the third week of the 2006 season of Nashville Star, and appeared at the 2007 Nickelodeon UK Kids Choice Awards.\n\nIn January 2007, Cena, Batista, and Ashley Massaro appeared representing WWE on an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, giving the children of the family whose house was being renovated WWE merchandise and eight tickets to WrestleMania 23. Two months later, he and Bobby Lashley appeared on the NBC game show Deal or No Deal as \"moral support\" to longtime WWE fan and front row staple, Rick \"Sign Guy\" Achberger. Edge and Randy Orton also appeared as antagonists. On April 9, 2008, Cena, along with fellow wrestlers Triple H and Chris Jericho, appeared on the Idol Gives Back fund-raising special. In March 2009, Cena made an appearance on Saturday Night Live during the show's cold opening sequence. On March 7, he was a guest on NPR's quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in a Not My Job sequence titled \"Sure, pro wrestling is a good gig, but when you win, do they throw teddy bears into the ring?\".\n\n\n=== Television ===\nIn 2001, between his training in Ultimate Pro Wrestling and Ohio Valley Wrestling, Cena was involved in the UPN produced reality show Manhunt, in which he portrayed Big Tim Kingman, leader of the group of bounty hunters who chased down the contestants who acted as fugitives. The show, however, was mired in controversy when it was alleged that the portions of the show were rigged to eliminate certain players, scenes were re-shot or staged to enhance drama and contestants read from scripts.\nCena was featured on the ABC reality series Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race, which aired in June 2007, making it to the final round before being eliminated on June 24, placing third in the competition overall.\nIn 2007, Cena was interviewed for the CNN Special Investigations Unit documentary Death Grip: Inside Pro Wrestling, which focused on steroid and drug use in professional wrestling. When asked if he had taken steroids, he was heard to reply, \"I can't tell you that I haven't, but you will never prove that I have\". The day after the documentary aired, WWE accused CNN of taking Cena's comments out of context to present a biased point of view, backing up their claim by posting an unedited video of Cena answering the same question – filmed by WWE cameras from another angle – in which he is heard beginning the same statement with \"absolutely not\". A text interview on the website with Cena later had him saying the news outlet should apologize for misrepresenting him, which CNN refused, saying they felt the true answer to the question began with the phrase \"my answer to that question\". However, they did edit the documentary on subsequent airings to include the \"absolutely not\".\nCena hosted the Australian Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards with Natalie Bassingthwaighte on October 11, 2008, in Melbourne. He guest starred as Ewan O'Hara, brother of Juliet O'Hara, in an episode of the fourth season of the comedy drama Psych.

Three nights later, Cena made an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers.\nCena hosted two seasons of American Grit on Fox, a reality television series with 10 episodes. 16 men and women were split into four teams, where challenges were given. A US$1 million prize was given to the winning team. American Grit premiered on Fox on April 14, 2016, and the finale of season 1 aired on June 9.\nCena hosted the ESPN ESPY Awards on July 13. On December 10, Cena was the guest host of Saturday Night Live on NBC.\nOn January 24, 2017, Nickelodeon announced that Cena would host the 2017 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards ceremony on March 11. On January 11, 2018, it was announced that he would be hosting the awards ceremony again on March 24, becoming the third host behind Whitney Houston and Rosie O'Donnell to host the ceremony in back to back years. Two days later, the game show Keep It Spotless premiered with Cena as an executive producer. In addition, he was cast on Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as the voice of the villain Baron Draxum.

He performed his fifth WWE theme song, \"Basic Thuganomics\", and it was featured on the WWE soundtrack album WWE Originals. He also recorded a song, \"Untouchables\", for the company's next soundtrack album WWE ThemeAddict: The Music, Vol. 6. He was featured on the remix for Murs's song \"H-U-S-T-L-E\", appearing in the video clip.\nCena's debut album, You Can't See Me, was recorded with his cousin Tha Trademarc. It features, among other songs, his entrance theme, \"The Time is Now\", and the single \"Bad, Bad Man\" alongside Bumpy Knuckles, for which a music video was made that parodied 1980s culture, notably the television show The A-Team. A video was also made for the second single, \"Right Now\", that premiered on WWE Monday Night Raw on August 8, 2005. Cena and Tha Trademarc were later featured on a track by the Perceptionists called \"Champion Scratch\". Cena was featured on T-Boz's postponed album, Still Cool.\nIn October 2014, Cena was featured on two songs with rapper Wiz Khalifa for his two singles \"All Day\" and \"Breaks\" for the soundtrack to the WWE 2K15 video game.\nCena is a self-taught pianist, starting to learn the instrument in 2016. In 2022, he performed a piano rendition of Mötley Crüe's \"Home Sweet Home\" for the Peacemaker soundtrack, playing it onscreen as his Peacemaker character in a poignant scene to close the episode \"Murn After Reading\".\n\n\n=== Discography ===\nStudio albums\n\nYou Can't See Me (2005)\nSoundtrack albums\n\nPeacemaker (2022)\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\n\nBefore his professional wrestling career, Cena appeared in an advertisement for Gold's Gym. As a wrestler, he has endorsed the energy drink YJ Stinger, appearing in commercials beginning in October 2003, and Subway, for whom he filmed advertisements with their spokesperson Jared Fogle in November 2006 that began airing the following January. In 2007, he also endorsed two \"signature collections\" of energy drinks and energy bars sold by American Body Builders.\nIn 2008, Cena filmed a commercial as part of Gillette's \"Young Guns\" NASCAR campaign. In 2009, Cena expanded his relationship with Gillette by introducing a new online campaign called \"Be A Superstar\" featuring himself alongside fellow WWE wrestlers Chris Jericho and Cody Rhodes. The campaign features motivational videos. After Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson called Cena \"Fruity Pebbles\" during their feud, in reference to Cena's colorful merchandise, Cena appeared on the box of Fruity Pebbles cereal in 2013.\nHe was the pace car driver for the 58th annual Daytona 500. On October 13, 2016, Cena made his debut as the voice of Ernie the Elephant in a new commercial campaign launched by Wonderful Pistachios. He was named to Adweek's \"Creative 100\" and received praise for his performance. In 2020, Cena and Honda announced a partnership, with Cena becoming the new voice of Honda.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\n\nCena has granted over 650 wishes for children with life-threatening illnesses through the Make-A-Wish Foundation—the most in Make-A-Wish history, with his first wish dating back to 2002. The Guinness Book of World Records confirmed that not only had Cena granted this many wishes by mid-2022, but that second place was fewer than 200. In 2009, Cena received the Chris Greicius Celebrity Award.\nFrom late 2011 until WrestleMania XXVIII, Cena wore a black \"Rise Above Hate\" T-shirt promoting WWE's \"Be a Star\" anti-bullying campaign.

Cena accepted the dare, but did it in reverse by waving his hand in front of his face instead to make it look more visible to his brother. Over time, this evolved into his signature catchphrase \"You Can't See Me\". In mid-2015, Cena was the subject of the Internet meme \"Unexpected John Cena\", also known as simply \"Unexpected Cena\" or \"IT'S JOHN CENA\". He has also been the subject of many memes due to his \"You can't see me\" catchphrase, such as being invisible in photos.\nOn May 10, 2021, Cena posted a video on his Weibo account, in which he sat in a car and ate ice cream while promoting the upcoming film Fast & Furious 9. In the video, Cena speaks Mandarin and sings into the ice cream cone as if it were a microphone. The video was viewed by millions of users and inspired the creation of the meme \"Bing Chilling\", a mishearing of bīngqílín (冰淇淋), which means ice cream and is said repeatedly in the video.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nCena resides in Land O' Lakes, Florida. He has often said that he does not want children because he would not want to be an absentee parent due to focusing on his career.\nWhile promoting his 2009 film 12 Rounds, Cena announced his engagement to Elizabeth Huberdeau. They were married on July 11, 2009. Cena filed for divorce on May 1, 2012, which was finalized on July 18. Later that year, he began dating fellow wrestler Nikki Bella. They became engaged on April 2, 2017, when Cena proposed to her at WrestleMania 33, but ended their relationship in April 2018; they had been planning to marry the following month, on May 5.\nCena began dating engineer Shay Shariatzadeh in early 2019, and they were married on October 12, 2020, in a private ceremony in Tampa, Florida. The two had met during the production of Cena's 2019 film Playing with Fire, which was filmed in Vancouver, where Shariatzadeh was working.\nCena started learning Mandarin Chinese in 2016 to help the WWE expand its reach, and he spoke in Mandarin at a press conference in China.\nIn December 2017, the Ford Motor Company sued Cena for breach of the contract under which he had bought his 2017 Ford GT. Ford alleged that he had sold it for a profit shortly after receiving it, instead of keeping the car for at least two years as agreed. Ford and Cena settled the dispute on June 19, 2018. While most of the settlement's details were not disclosed, it was reported that Cena had agreed to apologize to Ford, and that Ford had agreed to donate the amount they had received in the settlement to charity.\nFrom July to November 2018, Cena lived in Yinchuan, China, to work with Jackie Chan on the film Hidden Strike. While there, he also created a show on WWE's YouTube channel in which he highlighted his trips to local markets and other stores.\nOn March 31, 2025, Cena revealed he previously had skin cancer.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Video games ==\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\n\n\n=== Professional wrestling ===\nThe Baltimore Sun\nBest Feud of the Decade (2010) vs. Edge\nMatch of the Year (2007) vs. Shawn Michaels on April 23 at Raw\nWrestler of the Year (2007, 2010)\nFeud of the Year (2010) vs. The Nexus\nOhio Valley Wrestling\nOVW Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nOVW Southern Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Rico Constantino\nGuinness World Records\nLongest WWE face run before turning heel (7,786 days)\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nFeud of the Year (2006) vs. Edge\nFeud of the Year (2011) vs. CM Punk\nMatch of the Year (2007) vs. Shawn Michaels on Raw\nMatch of the Year (2011) vs. CM Punk at Money in the Bank\nMatch of the Year (2013) vs. Daniel Bryan at SummerSlam\nMatch of the Year (2014) vs. Bray Wyatt in a Last Man Standing match at Payback\nMatch of the Year (2016) vs. AJ Styles at SummerSlam\nMost Improved Wrestler of the Year (2003)\nMost Popular Wrestler of the Decade (2000–2009)\nMost Popular Wrestler of the Year (2004, 2005, 2007, 2012)\nWrestler of the Year (2006, 2007)\nRanked No. 1 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2006, 2007 and 2013\nRolling Stone\nBest Promos (2015) tied with Kevin Owens\nBest Storyline (2015) vs. Kevin Owens\nWWE Match of the Year (2015) vs. Kevin Owens at Money in the Bank\nSports Illustrated\nMuhammad Ali Legacy Award (2018)\nRanked No. 4 of the top 10 wrestlers in 2017\nRanked No. 4 of the 20 Greatest WWE Wrestlers Of All Time\nUltimate Pro Wrestling\nUPW Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment / WWE\nWWE Championship (14 times)\nWorld Heavyweight Championship (3 times)\nWWE United States Championship (5 times)\nWWE Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with The Miz (1) and David Otunga (1)\nWorld Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Batista (1) and Shawn Michaels (1)\nMoney in the Bank (2012 – WWE Championship contract)\nRoyal Rumble (2008, 2013)\nWWE Championship No. 1 Contender's Tournament (2003, 2005)\nSlammy Award (11 times)\nGame Changer of the Year (2011) – with The Rock\nHero in All of Us (2015)\nHoly $#!+ Move of the Year (2010) – Sending Batista through the stage with an Attitude Adjustment off the top of a car (occurred at Over the Limit, accepted by Wade Barrett on Cena's behalf) \nInsult of the Year (2012) – To Dolph Ziggler and Vickie Guerrero: \"You're the exact opposite.

        "title": "Arch Manning",
        "content": "Archibald Charles Manning (born April 27, 2004) is an American football quarterback for the Texas Longhorns. He is a member of the Manning family.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nManning was born on April 27, 2004, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Manning is the oldest son of Cooper Manning and Ellen Heidingsfelder. Through his father, he is grandson of Archie Manning, and nephew to Cooper's brothers, Peyton and Eli, all three former NFL quarterbacks. His younger brother, Heid, was the center for the football team and played lacrosse at Isidore Newman School.\n\n\n== High school football ==\nManning played high school football at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans. In his freshman year, Manning was the varsity starter at quarterback, the first freshman quarterback to start Newman's season opener in at least 40 years. He shined in his debut, leading Newman to a 26-point victory. In the final game of the season against Dunham, Manning threw for only 71 yards on 20 attempts and 10 completions. They would lose, 22–20. Manning completed his freshman season with 2,509 yards and 34 touchdowns, earning MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year honors.\nManning opened his sophomore season by having six touchdowns against East Jefferson. On October 15, 2020, he made his national television debut in a game against Booker T. Washington, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two more. In a game where Newman beat Cohen, 76–0, Manning passed for 169 yards and five touchdowns in the first quarter of action before being pulled from the game. In the first round of the Division III playoffs, Newman received a bye and played Catholic - N.I. in the second round. Manning would throw for 127 yards and a touchdown in the 14–7 win. In the final game of the season in the semifinals, Manning completed less than 50 percent of his passes and threw an interception to lose to Lafayette Christian Academy, 21–7.\nManning was again named the starting quarterback for Newman for his junior season in 2021. In Newman's first game against Vandebilt Catholic, Manning passed for 258 yards and accounted for all four touchdowns in the 28-point shutout victory.

The following week, Lafayette Christian would blow out Newman, 49–7. In 2021, Manning threw for 1,841 yards, 26 touchdowns, and four interceptions while having six rushing touchdowns.\nManning was the captain of the Newman football team for his senior season in 2022. In their matchup against Pearl River, Manning threw for 356 yards and seven touchdowns in a 59–7 victory, breaking his uncle Eli's Newman record of 7,268 career passing yards and his uncle Peyton's Newman record of 93 career touchdowns.\n\n\n=== Recruiting ===\n\nTo avoid a media frenzy, Manning's family withheld him from media interviews and also declined premature college scholarship offers. He ran a private account on Instagram, allowing only friends and coaches to follow him, including Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin. \"They've shut down everything,\" said one member of the local media, \"but the attention is going to come.\" In his college search he visited SMU, Clemson, LSU, Alabama, Texas, Georgia, and Virginia, as well as Ole Miss, his grandfather's, father's, and uncle's former team. On December 21, 2022, Manning signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Texas and committed on June 23, 2022; only then did he make his account public.\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\n\n== College career ==\n\n\n=== 2023 season ===\n\nAfter playing in the spring game for Team Orange, Manning was named the team's third-string quarterback behind Quinn Ewers and Maalik Murphy. Manning made his collegiate debut on November 24, during the third quarter of a blowout win against Texas Tech, completing 2-of-5 passing attempts for 30 yards. After the season, Manning was redshirted.\n\n\n=== 2024 season ===\n\nManning made his 2024 season debut against Colorado State when he entered the game in relief of Ewers during the third quarter while the Longhorns had a 38–0 lead. Manning finished with five completions for 95 yards and a touchdown. He also added a rushing touchdown. Against UTSA, Ewers left with an abdominal injury in the second quarter forcing Manning to come into the game with a 14–0 lead. On his first play of the game, Manning threw a 19-yard touchdown to DeAndre Moore. Two plays later, he rushed for a 67-yard touchdown to put the Longhorns ahead 28–7. After Manning threw a 75-yard strike to freshman wide receiver Ryan Wingo to go up 42–7, he added another passing touchdown in the fourth quarter to go up 49–7 before being relieved by freshman Trey Owens. Manning finished the game with 223 passing yards, 53 rushing yards, and five total touchdowns (four passing, one rushing) as Texas blew out UTSA, 56–7. On September 19, head coach Steve Sarkisian announced that Manning would be the starting quarterback the following week against Louisiana–Monroe. This announcement came after Manning shared the title of SEC Freshman of the Week with Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed for Week 3. He was also named Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award National Player of the Week and was tabbed to the Davey O'Brien Award Great 8 list.\n\n\n=== 2025 season ===\n\nManning was named the starting quarterback for the preseason #1 Texas Longhorns heading into the 2025 season. In the first game against the defending national champion #3 Ohio State Buckeyes, Manning struggled as he completed 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards, a touchdown, and an interception as the Longhorns lost 14–7 on the road.\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\n\n== Highlights and awards ==\n\n\n=== College ===\n\n\n=== High school ===\n\n\n==== Awards ====\nU.S. Army Bowl participant (2022)\nBobby Dodd National Back of the Year (2022)\nMaxPreps Sophomore All-American Second Team (2020)\nMaxPreps Freshman All-American First Team (2019)\n4× LFCA 2A All-State First Team (2019–2022)\nLCWA 2A All-State First Team (2022)\n3× LCWA 2A All-State Honorable Mention (2019–2021)\n\n\n==== Records ====\nIsidore Newman career total yards: 9,754\nIsidore Newman career total touchdowns: 140\nIsidore Newman career passing yards: 8,539\nIsidore Newman career passing touchdowns: 115\nIsidore Newman single-game passing touchdowns: 7 (September 30, 2022, vs. Pearl River)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTexas Longhorns profile",

The family subsequently settled in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, when she was two months old.\nShe is the youngest of four siblings, all of whom play tennis; her sister Gracia and brother Kevin played at the college level. Inspired by her older siblings, Victoria began playing tennis around the age of three or four.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2022-2023: Early years ===\nMboko made her WTA Tour main-draw debut at the 2022 Canadian Open in the doubles draw, partnering Kayla Cross. She made her first singles appearance as a wildcard at the 2022 Championnats de Granby, losing to Rebecca Marino. Her first professional singles title came at the W25 tournament in Saskatoon in 2022, a title she successfully defended in 2023. Her progress in earlier years had been affected by injuries.\nMboko reached the finals of two junior Grand Slam tournaments in 2022, losing in both doubles competitions at the Australian Open and at Wimbledon.\n\n\n=== 2025: Canadian Open title, top 25 ===\n\nIn January and February, Mboko won 22 successive matches without dropping a set to claim four ITF Circuit singles titles at tournaments in Le Lamentin, Martinique; Petit-Bourg, Guadeloupe; Rome, United States; and Manchester, United Kingdom. Her 20 consecutive ITF-level main-draw match wins during this period set a new record for Canadian women since the ITF began keeping such records in 1994. She won a fifth ITF title of the year in March at the W75 tournament in Porto, Portugal, defeating Harriet Dart in the final. By early May 2025, her win-loss record for the season was 33–3. This series of results contributed to her entering the WTA top 200 for the first time, reaching a career-high ranking of No. 156 on 31 March 2025.\nShe was given a wildcard entry into the Miami Open, her first WTA 1000 main draw. There, she recorded her first WTA Tour-level win by defeating Camila Osorio in the first round, before losing in the second round to 10th seed Paula Badosa in a third set tiebreak. Mboko then made her debut for the Canada Billie Jean King Cup team against Romania in the qualifying round of the BJK Cup held in Tokyo, recording a win over Miriam Bulgaru in the opening singles match.\nShe qualified for the Italian Open and defeated wildcard entrant Arianna Zucchini in the first round. In the second round, she lost to fourth seed Coco Gauff, in three sets. Mboko made her French Open debut, after winning all three qualifying matches in straight sets. There, she defeated Lulu Sun and Eva Lys, recording her first two major main-draw wins. She made her debut at Wimbledon, as a lucky loser, but lost to Hailey Baptiste in the second round.\nAt the Canadian Open, Mboko reached the quarterfinals by upsetting top seed and world No. 2, Coco Gauff, in straight sets. She followed that win by defeating Jéssica Bouzas Maneiro to reach the semifinals. She became the youngest player to reach the semifinals in Canada since Belinda Bencic in 2015. After saving a match point, Mboko defeated ninth seed Elena Rybakina in three sets to reach her first WTA Tour final. In the final, she defeated Naomi Osaka in three sets to lift her first career title, becoming the third Canadian to win the home-country tournament and the first to do it in Montréal. As a result, she reached the top 25 at No. 24 in the WTA singles rankings on 11 August 2025.\n\n\n== Playing style ==\nMboko plays right-handed with a two-handed backhand. According to the WTA, her game is built around a strong serve and a counterpunching backhand, and she also utilizes drop shots regularly. She has credited Tennis Canada and the support from fellow Canadian players for her development.\n\n\n== Performance timeline ==\n\nOnly WTA Tour (incl. Grand Slams) main-draw and Billie Jean King Cup results are considered in the career statistics.\nCurrent through the 2025 US Open.\n\n\n== WTA 1000 tournaments ==\n\n\n=== Singles: 1 (title) ===\n\n\n== WTA Tour finals ==\n\n\n=== Singles: 1 (title) ===\n\n\n== WTA Challenger finals ==\n\n\n=== Singles: 1 (runner-up) ===\n\n\n== ITF Circuit finals ==\n\n\n=== Singles: 11 (8 titles, 3 runner-ups) ===\n\n\n=== Doubles: 2 (2 titles) ===\n\n\n== Junior Grand Slam finals ==\n\n\n=== Doubles: 2 (2 runner-ups) ===\n\n\n== Wins over top-10 players ==\nMboko has a 1–2 record against players who were, at the time the match was played, ranked in the top 10.\n\n\n== WTA Tour career earnings ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVictoria Mboko at the Women's Tennis Association\nVictoria Mboko at the International Tennis Federation\nVictoria Mboko at the Billie Jean King Cup\nVictoria Mboko at Wimbledon\nVictoria Mboko at ESPN.com",

        "title": "Benjamin Šeško",
        "content": "Benjamin Šeško (pronounced [ˈbeːnjamin ˈʃɛːʃkɔ], born 31 May 2003) is a Slovenian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Manchester United and the Slovenia national team.\nŠeško joined Red Bull Salzburg aged 16 in 2019 from Domžale. He was loaned to the Salzburg's reserve team FC Liefering for two seasons, where he scored 22 goals in 44 games in the second tier of Austrian football. He made his first-team debut for Red Bull Salzburg in January 2021 and went on to win three Austrian Bundesliga titles and one Austrian Cup. In July 2023, Šeško joined German club RB Leipzig, where he scored 39 goals in 87 appearances over two seasons, and won one DFL-Supercup.\nŠeško represented Slovenia at youth international level, before becoming the youngest player to appear for the senior national team in 2021, aged 18, and scored his first goal for the national team in October 2021, making him Slovenia's youngest ever goalscorer.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nŠeško began his career at his hometown club Radeče when he was in the first grade. He then spent one year with Rudar Trbovlje in the under-11 selection, before returning to Radeče. In 2016 he transferred to Krško, where he played for the under-15s and under-17s. In the 2017–18 season, he scored 59 goals in 23 matches for the under-15s. In 2018, Šeško joined Domžale, where he stayed for one season.\n\n\n=== Red Bull Salzburg ===\nAt the age of 16, on 3 June 2019, Šeško signed a three-year professional contract with Red Bull Salzburg. He debuted with Red Bull Salzburg in a 3–0 Austrian Football Bundesliga win over TSV Hartberg on 30 January 2021.\n\n\n==== Loan to FC Liefering ====\nImmediately after signing with Red Bull Salzburg, he was moved to their farm club FC Liefering, competing in the Austrian Second League. In the 2020–21 season, he scored 21 goals in 29 appearances and became the league's second-best goalscorer. He scored most of his goals in the final part of the season, scoring 13 goals in the last 7 rounds.\n\n\n=== RB Leipzig ===\nOn 9 August 2022, RB Leipzig announced that Šeško would join them on 1 July 2023, on a five-year contract until 2028, for a reported transfer fee of around €24 million.\nOn 3 September 2023, Šeško scored his first goals for RB Leipzig by netting a brace in a 3–0 away win over Union Berlin, which ended their 24-match streak without loss at home. On 19 September, he scored his first UEFA Champions League goal (excluding qualifying rounds) as RB Leipzig defeated Young Boys 3–1 away from home in the matchday 1 of the 2023–24 edition. Šeško finished his first season with 18 goals across all competitions, and also became the youngest ever player to score in seven consecutive Bundesliga games at 20 years and 353 days.\nIn June 2024, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and AC Milan all pursued Šeško, but he decided to stay with RB Leipzig, extending his existing contract by another year until 2029. During the 2024–25 season, he emerged as RB Leipzig's top scorer, setting a personal record with 21 goals in all competitions.\n\n\n=== Manchester United ===\nOn 9 August 2025, Premier League club Manchester United announced the signing of Šeško on a five-year contract until 2030, thus becoming the first-ever Slovenian to represent the club. The transfer fee was reported to be an initial €76.5 million, with an additional €8.5 million in performance related add-ons. On 17 August, he made his debut for the club, as a substitute, in a 1–0 loss against Arsenal in the opening round of the Premier League.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\nEligible for Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (due to his mother hailing from Doboj), Šeško opted for the former, having represented the country at the under-15, under-16, under-17, and under-19 levels. He made his under-19 debut in a friendly game against Austria in September 2020.\nIn May 2021, Šeško was called up by the senior team manager Matjaž Kek for a pair of friendlies in June 2021. He debuted for Slovenia in a 1–1 friendly tie with North Macedonia on 1 June 2021. At the time he was 18 years and 1 day old and became the youngest debutant in the national team, surpassing the previous record set by Petar Stojanović seven years earlier. On 8 October 2021, Šeško scored his first goal for Slovenia in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Malta, becoming Slovenia's youngest ever goalscorer at the age of 18 years, 4 months and 8 days.\n\nDuring the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League B campaign, Šeško helped Slovenia avoid relegation to League C with two decisive goals. He provided an assist and scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Norway on 24 September 2022, and also scored in a 1–1 draw against Sweden three days later. The goal against Sweden was described as a \"wonder goal\" by the media, and was nominated as one of the best goals of the matchday by UEFA.\nŠeško was Slovenia's top scorer in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers, netting five goals from nine appearances in Group H as Slovenia qualified for its first European Championship since 2000. He was later named in the squad for the final tournament, where he played in all four Slovenia's matches. The team advanced to the knockout stages for the first time and was eliminated by Portugal in the round of 16 on penalties.\nOn 9 September 2024, Šeško scored his first international hat-trick in a 3–0 victory over Kazakhstan in the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League B.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\nŠeško is described as a tall, athletic centre-forward known for his powerful finishing, explosive pace, and aerial ability, standing at 1.95 m (6 ft 5 in). He has also recorded a top speed of 35.7 km/h, which is just 1.5 km/h slower than the fastest player in Bundesliga.\nŠeško is considered one of the most promising young strikers in Europe. His combination of physical strength and technical ability has led to comparisons with Zlatan Ibrahimović, who he cited as a role model during his formative years. Recruitment analysts have described Šeško as a clinical forward capable of dropping into space, holding off defenders, and linking effectively with teammates in advanced positions.\nWhile he initially operated primarily as a penalty-box striker, Šeško has gradually expanded his involvement in the build-up phase, becoming more engaged in general play around the final third. He has shown improvement in his link-up play and movement off the ball, often dropping deeper to support attacking transitions and contribute to team possession beyond just finishing chances.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of match played 30 August 2025\n\n\n=== International ===\nAs of match played 23 March 2025\n\nScores and results list Slovenia's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Šeško goal.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nRed Bull Salzburg\n\nAustrian Bundesliga: 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23\nAustrian Cup: 2021–22\nRB Leipzig\n\nDFL-Supercup: 2023\nIndividual\n\nSlovenian Footballer of the Year: 2022\nSlovenian Youth Footballer of the Year: 2021, 2022, 2023\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBenjamin Šeško profile at the Manchester United F.C. website\nBenjamin Šeško national team profile at NZS (in Slovene)\nBenjamin Šeško club profile at NZS (in Slovene)\nBenjamin Šeško – UEFA competition record (archive)",

        "title": "Jim Lovell",
        "content": "James Arthur Lovell Jr. (  LUV-əl; March 25, 1928 – August 7, 2025) was an American astronaut, naval aviator, test pilot, and mechanical engineer. In 1968, as command module pilot of Apollo 8, he, along with Frank Borman and William Anders, became one of the first three astronauts to fly to and orbit the Moon. He then commanded the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970 which, after a critical failure en route, looped around the Moon and returned safely to Earth.\nA 1952 graduate of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Lovell flew McDonnell F2H Banshee night fighters. He was deployed in the Western Pacific aboard the aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La. In January 1958, he entered a six-month test pilot training course at the Naval Air Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, with Class 20 and graduated at the top of the class. He was then assigned to Electronics Test, working with radar, and in 1960 he became the Navy's McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II program manager. In 1961, he became a flight instructor and safety engineering officer at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and completed Aviation Safety School at the University of Southern California.\nLovell was not selected by NASA as one of the Mercury Seven astronauts due to a temporarily high bilirubin count. He was accepted in September 1962 as one of the second group of astronauts needed for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Prior to Apollo, Lovell flew in space on two Gemini missions, Gemini 7 (with Borman) in 1965 and Gemini 12 in 1966. He was the first person to fly into space four times. Among the 24 astronauts who have orbited the Moon, Lovell was the earliest to make a second visit but remains the only returnee never to walk on the surface. He was a recipient of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He co-authored the 1994 book Lost Moon, on which the 1995 film Apollo 13 was based, and he was featured in a cameo appearance in the film. Lovell died in 2025, aged 97.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJames Arthur Lovell Jr. was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 25, 1928. He was the only child of James Lovell Sr., a furnace salesman born in Toronto, Canada, who died in a car accident in 1933 when Jr. was 5. and Blanche (née Masek), who was of Czech descent. For two years after the death of his father, Lovell and his mother lived with a relative in Terre Haute, Indiana. They then moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and he went to Juneau High School. He was a member of the Boy Scouts during his childhood and became an Eagle Scout, the organization's highest rank. He was interested in rocketry and built flying models as a teenager.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Lovell attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison for two years, where he studied engineering under the United States Navy's \"Flying Midshipman\" program from 1946 to 1948. He later credited the program for giving him the opportunity to attend college, saying that he otherwise did not have the money to attend. At Wisconsin, he played college football and pledged to the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. He supplemented a meager Navy stipend by working at a local restaurant washing dishes and busing tables, and caring for the university's lab rats and mice on weekends.\nWhile Lovell was attending pre-flight training in the summer of 1948, the Navy was beginning to make cutbacks in the program, and cadets were under a great deal of pressure to transfer out. There were concerns that some or most of the students who graduated as naval aviators would not have pilot billets to fill. To avoid this outcome, Lovell decided to apply to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He secured a nomination from his local U.S. Representative, John C. Brophy, and entered Annapolis in July 1948.\nDuring his first year, Lovell wrote a treatise on the liquid-propellant rocket engine. He graduated in the spring of 1952 with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned as an ensign in the Navy.\n\n\n== Marriage and family ==\nLovell began dating Marilyn Lillie Gerlach while they were in high school. As a college student, she transferred from Wisconsin State Teachers College to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., to be near him while he was attending the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. They married on June 6, 1952, in a ceremony at St. Anne's Church in Annapolis. The couple had four children: Barbara, James, Susan, and Jeffrey.\n\n\n== Navy career ==\nLovell was one of 50 members of his graduating class of 783 initially selected for naval aviation training. He went to flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola from October 1952 to February 1954. He was designated a naval aviator on February 1, 1954, upon completion of pilot training, and was assigned to VC-3 at Moffett Field near San Francisco, California. From 1954 to 1956 he flew McDonnell F2H Banshee night fighters. This included a Western Pacific deployment aboard the aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La. Lovell eventually completed 107 carrier deck landings. Upon his return to shore duty, he was reassigned to provide pilot transition training for the North American FJ-4 Fury, McDonnell F3H Demon, and Vought F8U Crusader.\nIn January 1958, Lovell entered a six-month test pilot training course at what was then the Naval Air Test Center (now the United States Naval Test Pilot School) at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, with Class 20, which also included future astronauts Wally Schirra and Pete Conrad, who gave Lovell the nickname \"Shaky\". Lovell graduated at the top of the class. Usually, the top graduate was assigned to flight test on graduation. Still, the head of electronics test had complained about never getting the top graduate, so Lovell was assigned there, where he worked with radar sets.\nLater that year, Lovell, Conrad, and Schirra were among 110 military test pilots selected as potential astronaut candidates for Project Mercury. Schirra went on to become one of the Mercury Seven, but Lovell was not selected because of a temporarily high bilirubin count. In 1960, electronics test and armaments test were combined and became weapons test, and Lovell became the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II program manager. During this time future astronaut John Young served under him. In 1961 Lovell received orders for VF-101 \"Detachment Alpha\" at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia, as a flight instructor and safety engineering officer, and he completed Aviation Safety School at the University of Southern California.\n\n\n== NASA career ==\n\n\n=== Astronaut selection ===\n\nIn 1962, NASA began recruiting its second group of astronauts, intended to fly during the Gemini and Apollo programs. This time the process was a public one. Lovell found out about the selection from an advertisement that had been placed in Aviation Week & Space Technology, and decided to apply a second time. A three-person selection panel consisting of Mercury Seven astronauts Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton, and NASA test pilot Warren J. North, reduced the candidates to 32 finalists, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio for medical examinations. The tests there were much the same as those employed to select the Mercury Seven, but this time Lovell passed. The remaining 27 then went to Ellington Air Force Base near Houston, where they were individually interviewed by the selection panel.\nOn September 14, Slayton informed Lovell that he had been accepted. To avoid tipping off the media, Lovell checked into the Rice Hotel in Houston under the name of Max Peck, its general manager. On September 17, the media crowded into the 1800-seat Cullen Auditorium at the University of Houston for the official announcement, but it wasn't as big as the unveiling of the Mercury Seven three years before. The group became known as the \"Next Nine\" or the \"New Nine\". The new astronauts moved to the Houston area in October 1962. Conrad and Lovell built houses in Timber Cove, south of the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC). Developers in Timber Cove offered astronauts mortgages with small down payments and low interest rates. The MSC complex was not yet complete, so NASA temporarily leased office space in Houston.\nThe task of supervising the Next Nine's training fell to Mercury Seven astronaut Gus Grissom. Initially, each of the astronauts was given four months of classroom instruction on subjects such as spacecraft propulsion, orbital mechanics, astronomy, computing, and space medicine. Classes were for six hours a day, two days a week, and all sixteen astronauts had to attend. There was also familiarization with the Gemini spacecraft, Titan II and Atlas boosters, and the Agena target vehicle. Jungle survival training was conducted at the United States Air Force (USAF) Tropic Survival School at Albrook Air Force Station in the Panama Canal Zone, desert survival training at Stead Air Force Base in Nevada, and water survival training on the Dilbert Dunker at the USN school at Naval Air Station Pensacola and on Galveston Bay. Following the precedent set by the Mercury Seven, each of the Next Nine was assigned a special area in which to develop expertise that could be shared with the others, and to provide astronaut input to designers and engineers. Lovell became responsible for recovery systems.\n\n\n=== Gemini program ===\n\n\n==== Gemini 7 ====\n\nLovell was selected as backup pilot for Gemini 4, which was officially announced on July 29, 1964. It put him in position for his first space flight three missions later, as pilot of Gemini 7 with command pilot Frank Borman, under a rotation system devised by Slayton. Borman was a USAF officer, and Lovell had first met him during the evaluation process for astronaut selection. Their selection for the Gemini 7 mission was officially announced on July 1, 1965, along with that of Edward White and Michael Collins as their backup crew.\nLike all Gemini missions, it was part of the preparations for Apollo. The flight's objective was to evaluate the effects on the crew and spacecraft from fourteen days in orbit, this being sufficiently long for any possible Moon mission, and would therefore enable doctors to evaluate the medical aspects of such a flight. The Gemini 6 mission preceding it was to demonstrate techniques for space rendezvous, also a critical requirement for Apollo. These techniques had been worked out by Dean F. Grimm and Buzz Aldrin, who had written his doctoral thesis on the subject.\nThe Gemini 6 mission, which was commanded by Schirra with Tom Stafford as pilot, had a serious setback on October 15, 1965, when the Agena target vehicle that Gemini 6 was supposed to rendezvous with exploded soon after takeoff. Lovell was present at the Launch Control Center at Cape Kennedy when this occurred. Officials from McDonnell, the manufacturer of the Gemini spacecraft, then raised the possibility of a rendezvous between Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 during the two weeks while Gemini 7 was in orbit. The only change to the latter's flight plan this required was to circularize its orbit to match that intended for the Agena target vehicle. Borman rejected a proposal by Schirra that Lovell and Stafford exchange places, on the grounds that it was hazardous and likely to jeopardize the fourteen-day mission objective through loss of oxygen.\nIn planning the mission, it was decided that both astronauts would sleep at the same time and observe the same work periods, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Experiments were not scheduled, but fitted in when time allowed. Of the twenty experiments, eight were medical, aimed at gathering data about the effects of long-duration space flight. Of the rest, four were tests of spacecraft systems, five involved radiometry or navigation, and three involved photography and observation, To save space, the G5C spacesuit was designed to incorporate a soft hood instead of a helmet and zippers instead of a neck ring. It weighed a third less than the standard Gemini space suit and could be stowed more easily.\nGemini 7 lifted off on December 4, 1965, and reached its intended 300-kilometer (160 nmi; 180 mi) near-circular orbit. Lovell, who was taller than Borman, had more difficulty donning and removing his spacesuit. Mission rules required that one astronaut remain suited at all times, but the suits made the astronauts uncomfortably warm. Mission control eventually relented and allowed both to leave their suits off. Gemini 6, now called Gemini 6A, attempted to launch on December 12; the engines ignited, but shut down less than two seconds later due to an electrical problem and a fuel cap accidentally having been left in place. After repairs, Gemini 6A successfully lifted off on December 15, and rendezvoused with Gemini 7 on Gemini 6A's fourth orbit. The two spacecraft then flew in tandem for three orbits, the distance between them varying between 0.30 and 90 meters (1 and 300 ft). Gemini 6A returned to Earth on December 16.\nIn the final two days of the mission, Lovell had time to read part of Drums Along the Mohawk by Walter D. Edmonds. As in earlier long-duration flights, malfunctions accumulated as the flight wore on. Two of the thrusters stopped working. After the flight, this was traced to the fact that they had an old type of laminate in the thrust chamber instead of the new type that had been developed to solve this problem. This proved to be only an annoyance, but there was more concern over a loss of power in the fuel cells. By day thirteen, a warning light was illuminated continuously and it was feared that the cells, which were only giving partial output, might fail completely, and the mission might have to be cut short; tests were carried out in St. Louis that demonstrated that the batteries could sustain them for the remainder of the flight. Gemini 7 made a successful return from orbit on December 18. The fourteen-day flight set an endurance record, making 206 orbits.\n\n\n==== Gemini 12 ====\n\nOn January 24, 1966, Lovell was named as the backup command pilot of Gemini 10, with Aldrin as the pilot. On March 21, this was changed as a result of the deaths of the Gemini 9 prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, in an air crash. The Gemini 9 backup crew of Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan became the prime crew of Gemini 9A, and Lovell and Aldrin became their backups. This positioned Lovell for his second flight and first command, of Gemini 12. Lovell and Aldrin's selection for this mission was officially announced on June 17, along with that of Gordon Cooper and Gene Cernan as their backups.\n\nThe goals of Gemini 12, the final Gemini mission, were ill-defined at first. \"Essentially Gemini 12 didn't have a mission\", Lovell later recalled. \"It was, I guess, by default ... supposed to wind up the Gemini program and catch all those items that were not caught on previous flights.\" By July, its mission had become to master extravehicular activity (EVA), something that had proven problematic on earlier Gemini missions, as they had been more strenuous than expected and performing simple tasks had been more complicated. A series of innovations had been developed in response to the problems that had been encountered. It had been found that moving in space was similar to being underwater, and Aldrin made use of this new training technique. A waist restraint was provided on the space suit, and the Gemini spacecraft and the Agena target vehicle had additional handrails, handholds, and rings for tethering the waist restraint. Procedures were modified to minimize fatigue.\nGemini 12 lifted off on November 11, and quickly achieved orbit. Its first task was to rendezvous with its Agena target vehicle. This was complicated when the rendezvous radar set failed. Instead, Aldrin, who had written his PhD on the rendezvous, used a sextant to measure the angle between the spacecraft and the Agena, and then calculated the required actions using the onboard computer. Lovell then flew the spacecraft accordingly. Rendezvous was achieved, and Gemini successfully docked with the Agena, achieving the fifth space rendezvous and fourth space docking with an Agena target vehicle. Lovell then successfully undocked and docked again.\nAldrin performed three EVAs. The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. It set an EVA record of two hours and twenty minutes. The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. He performed several tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for Apollo. The EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes. Before returning to the spacecraft, Aldrin cleaned the pilot's window with a cloth, and Lovell jokingly asked him if he could change the oil too. A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.\nGemini 12 returned to Earth on November 15, after 59 orbits. During re-entry a pouch containing books and small pieces of equipment broke free and landed in Lovell's lap. He did not want to grab it, as he feared he might pull on the D-ring that activated the ejector seat. It did not move any further, and the landing went well. The spacecraft landed 5.6 kilometers (3 nmi; 3.5 mi) from the recovery ship, the aircraft carrier USS Wasp. Twelve experiments had been carried out. This mission proved that people could work effectively outside the spacecraft, which was required for the Apollo missions with the goal of getting man on the Moon by the end of the decade.\n\n\n=== Apollo program ===\n\n\n==== Apollo 1 ====\n\nOn January 27, 1967, Grissom, White and Roger Chaffee were killed in the Apollo 1 fire. At the time, Lovell was in Washington, D.C., where, along with fellow astronauts Neil Armstrong, Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper and Richard Gordon, he had attended the signing of the Outer Space Treaty and the reception afterwards in the Green Room of the White House hosted by President Lyndon Johnson. Four days later, Lovell flew to West Point, New York, with Borman in a NASA T-38 for the funeral service for White at the Old Cadet Chapel. After the service, White was laid to rest in the West Point Cemetery; Lovell served as a pallbearer along with Armstrong, Borman, Conrad, Stafford and Aldrin.\nThe Apollo command module was redesigned after the fire, and afterwards it underwent a series of qualification tests. In April 1968, Lovell, along with fellow astronauts Stuart Roosa and Charles Duke, spent 48 hours in command module CM-007A, bobbing in the Gulf of Mexico to test the seaworthiness of the Apollo spacecraft. The NASA research vessel MV Retriever stood by with technicians and divers, while the astronauts assessed how quickly the spacecraft's flotation devices could right it from the \"stable II\" (upside down) position. The urine collection hose was used to vacuum up water that entered the cabin. Although this did not seem to bother Lovell, Duke regarded it as his worst experience as an astronaut, and Roosa became quite seasick. The NASA Roundup newspaper wrote the event up under the headline, \"Yo, Ho, Ho and a Bottle of Marezine\", referencing the brand name of a motion sickness drug.\n\n\n==== Apollo 8 ====\n\nLovell was originally chosen as command module pilot (CMP) on the backup crew for Apollo 9 along with Armstrong as commander (CDR) and Aldrin as lunar module pilot (LMP). Apollo 9 was planned as a high-apogee Earth orbital test of the Lunar Module (LM). Lovell later replaced Michael Collins as CMP on the Apollo 9 prime crew in July 1968 when Collins needed to have surgery for a bone spur on his spine. This reunited Lovell with his Gemini 7 commander Frank Borman, along with LMP William Anders. Aldrin became Lovell's backup CMP, and Fred Haise joined Armstrong's crew as LMP.\n\nConstruction delays of the first crewed LM prevented it from being ready in time to fly on Apollo 8, planned as a low Earth orbit test. It was decided to swap the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 prime and backup crews in the flight schedule so that the crew trained for the low-orbit test could fly it as Apollo 9, when the LM would be ready. A lunar orbital flight, now Apollo 8, replaced the original Apollo 9 medium Earth orbit test mission. The crew was informed of this decision on August 10, 1968, and the training schedule was adjusted accordingly. Starting in September, the crew spent ten hours a day in the simulator rehearsing the mission.\nApollo 8 was launched on December 21, 1968, and Borman, Lovell and Anders became the first crew to ride the Saturn V rocket, as well as the first to travel to the Moon. Their Apollo craft entered lunar orbit on December 24 (Christmas Eve) and reduced speed to go into a 10.9-by-312.1-kilometer (5.9 by 168.5 nmi; 6.8 by 193.9 mi) orbit. The engine was then fired again to enter a 111-kilometer (60 nmi; 69 mi) circular orbit around the Moon.\nOn Christmas Eve, the crew broadcast black-and-white television pictures of the lunar surface back to Earth. Lovell took his turn with Borman and Anders in reading a passage from the Biblical creation story in the Book of Genesis. They made a total of ten orbits of the Moon in 20 hours and ten minutes, and began their return to Earth on December 25 (Christmas Day) with a rocket burn made on the Moon's far side, out of radio contact with Earth. When contact was re-established, Lovell broadcast, \"Please be informed, there is a Santa Claus.\"\n\nAs CMP, Lovell served as navigator, using the spacecraft's sextant to determine its position by measuring star positions. These measurements were used to calculate required mid-course corrections. During otherwise idle time, he conducted navigational sightings, maneuvering the module to view stars and entering data via the Apollo Guidance Computer keyboard. During one of these data entries, Lovell accidentally erased some of the computer's memory by entering the wrong codes, causing the inertial measurement unit (IMU) to register the module as having the same orientation it did before liftoff. The IMU then initiated thruster firings to \"correct\" for this newly registered attitude.\nAfter identifying the issue, the crew knew that they would have to reenter the orientation data. Lovell took about ten minutes to calculate the correct values, using the thrusters to align the stars Rigel and Sirius in the sextant, and another 15 minutes to enter the correct measurements into the computer. The experience later proved valuable during Apollo 13, when Lovell had to perform a similar manual realignment under critical conditions after the IMU had been turned off to conserve energy.\nA feature on the Moon's surface (Mount Marilyn) was named by Lovell in honor of his wife.\nThe spacecraft splashed down safely before dawn on December 27 after 147 hours of flight, 4.8 kilometers (2.6 nmi; 3.0 mi) from the recovery ship, the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown. It was estimated that the crew had traveled 933,419 kilometers (504,006 nmi; 580,000 mi).\n\n\n==== Apollo 13 ====\n\nLovell was backup CDR of Apollo 11, with Anders as CMP, and Haise as LMP. In early 1969, Anders accepted a job with the National Aeronautics and Space Council effective August 1969, and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time. Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable.\nUnder the normal crew rotation in place during Apollo, Lovell, Mattingly, and Haise were scheduled to fly as the prime crew of Apollo 14, but George Mueller, the director of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, rejected Slayton's choice of fellow Mercury Seven astronaut Alan Shepard to command Apollo 13. Shepard had only recently returned to flight status after being grounded for several years, and Mueller thought that he needed more training time to prepare for a mission to the Moon. Slayton then asked Lovell if he was willing to switch places with Shepard's crew to give them more training time. \"Sure, why not?\" Lovell replied, \"What could possibly be the difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14?\"\nThere was one more change. Seven days before launch, a member of the Apollo 13 backup crew, Duke, contracted rubella from a friend of his son. This exposed both the prime and backup crews, who trained together. Of the five, only Mattingly was not immune through prior exposure. Normally, if any member of the prime crew had to be grounded, the remaining crew would be replaced as well, and the backup crew substituted, but Duke's illness ruled this out, so two days before launch, Mattingly was replaced by Jack Swigert from the backup crew. Mattingly never developed rubella and later flew to the Moon on Apollo 16.\nLovell lifted off aboard Apollo 13 on April 11, 1970. He and Haise were to land near the Fra Mauro crater. The Fra Mauro formation was believed to contain much material spattered by the impact that had filled the Imbrium basin early in the Moon's history, and dating it would provide information about the early history of the Earth and the Moon.\n\nDuring a routine liquid oxygen tank stir in transit to the Moon, a fire started inside an oxygen tank. The most probable cause determined by NASA was damaged electrical insulation on wiring that created a spark that started the fire. A problem with draining the tank had been reported before the mission, and Lovell had approved the action taken to turn on the heaters to purge the oxygen rather than to replace the faulty tank, which would have delayed the mission by a month. Neither he nor the launch pad crew were aware that the tank contained the wrong thermostat switch. The heaters were left on for eight hours, and while this successfully purged the oxygen, it also removed teflon insulation from the copper electrical wiring. Liquid oxygen rapidly turned into a high-pressure gas, which burst the tank and caused the leak of a second oxygen tank. In just over two hours, all onboard oxygen was lost, disabling the hydrogen fuel cells that provided electrical power to the Command/Service Module Odyssey.\n\nApollo 13 was the second mission not to use a free-return trajectory, so that they could explore the western lunar regions. Using the Apollo Lunar Module as a \"life boat\" providing battery power, oxygen, and propulsion, Lovell and his crew re-established the free return trajectory that they had left, and swung around the Moon to return home. Based on the flight controllers' calculations made on Earth, Lovell had to adjust the course twice by manually controlling the Lunar Module's thrusters and engine.\nApollo 13 returned safely to Earth on April 17. \"I'm afraid\", Lovell said, \"this is going to be the last lunar mission for a long time.\" His comment was rebutted by NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine, who hastened to reassure the public that NASA would be mounting more missions to the Moon. Nine months later, Apollo 14 would make the voyage to Fra Mauro, with modified oxygen tanks and an extra battery for emergencies.\nAs Lovell said to NASA's \"Houston we Have a Podcast\" in 2020: \"You can't suddenly have a problem, and then just you know, close your eyes and then hope there's a miracle coming on, because a miracle is something you have to do yourself, or having people to help you.\"\nApollo 13's flight trajectory gave Lovell, Haise, and Swigert the record for the farthest distance that humans have ever traveled from Earth. Lovell is one of only three men to travel to the Moon twice, but unlike the other two, John Young and Gene Cernan, he never walked on it. He accrued 715 hours and 5 minutes in space flights on his Gemini and Apollo flights, a personal record that stood until the Skylab 3 mission in 1973.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\n\nLovell retired from the Navy and the space program on March 1, 1973, and went to work at the Bay-Houston Towing Company in Houston, Texas, taking on the role of CEO in 1975. He became president of Fisk Telephone Systems in 1977, and later worked for Centel Corporation in Chicago, retiring as an executive vice president on January 1, 1991. Lovell was a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. He was also recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with their Silver Buffalo Award.\nLovell served on the board of directors for several organizations, including Federal Signal Corporation in Chicago from 1984 to 2003, the Astronautics Corporation of America in his hometown of Milwaukee from 1990 to 1999, and Centel from 1987 to 1991.\nIn 1999, the Lovell family opened a restaurant in Lake Forest, Illinois, \"Lovell's of Lake Forest\". The restaurant displayed memorabilia from Lovell's time with NASA and the filming of Apollo 13. The restaurant was sold to son and executive chef James (\"Jay\") in 2006. The restaurant was put on the market for sale in February 2014, and it closed in April 2015, the property being auctioned the same month.\nLovell's wife, Marilyn (born July 11, 1930), died of natural causes on August 27, 2023, at the age of 93. \nLovell died on August 7, 2025, at his home in Lake Forest, Illinois, at the age of 97.\n\n\n== Awards and decorations ==\n\nLovell's awards and decorations include:\n\n\n=== Military, federal service, and foreign awards ===\nNavy Distinguished Service Medal with gold star\nDistinguished Flying Cross with gold star\nPresidential Medal of Freedom\nCongressional Space Medal of Honor\nNASA Distinguished Service Medal\nNASA Exceptional Service Medal with star\nLégion d'honneur (Chevalier)\n\n\n=== Other awards and accomplishments ===\nAlpha Phi Omega Fall Pledge Class Namesake (1967)\nAmerican Academy of Achievement Golden Plate Award (1968)\nHenry H. Arnold Trophy (1969)\nInstitute of Navigation Award (1969)\nNational Geographic Society's Hubbard Medal (1969)\nFédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) De Laval Medal & Gold Space Medals (1971)\nDistinguished Eagle Scout Award (1990)\nSilver Buffalo (Boy Scouts of America) (1992)\nSpace Foundation's General James E.

Lovell received a second Harmon International Trophy in 1967 when he and Aldrin were selected for their Gemini 12 flight. The Apollo 8 crew won the Robert J. Collier Trophy for 1968. President Richard Nixon awarded them the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy in 1969, which Lovell accepted on behalf of the crew. The General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy is normally awarded to Air Force personnel, but an exception was made to include Lovell so that the entire Apollo 8 crew were awarded the 1968 trophy. Lovell was awarded a third Harmon International Trophy in 1969 for his role in the Apollo 8 mission. The Apollo 8 crew was also awarded the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Haley Astronautics Award for 1970, and were named Time Magazine Men of the Year in 1968. The Apollo 7, 8, 9, and 10 crews were awarded the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Special Trustees Award for 1969.\nLovell was one of ten Gemini astronauts inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982, and, along with the other 12 Gemini astronauts, Lovell was inducted into the second U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame class in 1993.\nAt a parade attended by 500,000 people, Lovell was conferred Chicago's medal of merit. The Apollo 13 crew was awarded the City of New York Gold Medal, but Lovell had already received it for the Apollo 8 mission. In lieu of a second medal, the mayor gifted him a crystal paperweight that he \"invented for the occasion\". He was also awarded the 1970 City of Houston Medal for Valor for the mission. He was awarded his second Haley Astronautics Award for his role on Apollo 13.\nLovell was featured on the cover of Time magazine on January 3, 1969, and April 27, 1970, and on the cover of Life magazine on April 24, 1970.\nLovell was a recipient of the University of Wisconsin's Distinguished Alumni Service Award in 1970. In his acceptance speech he emphasized the use of words over \"rock throwing\" to help attain political goals. He was awarded an honorary doctor of science degree at Western Michigan University's summer commencement exercises in 1970. He was also awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree at William Paterson College's commencement exercises in 1974. Lovell was also granted an honorary doctor of science degree from University of Wisconsin–Madison, his original alma mater, speaking at the December 2016 commencement.\n\n\n=== Tributes ===\nA small crater on the far side of the Moon was named Lovell in his honor in 1970. Discovery World in Milwaukee was renamed The James Lovell Museum of Science, Economics and Technology. It was at the time located on James Lovell St., also named for Lovell. The Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center was completed in October 2010, merging the Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes and the North Chicago Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\nTom Hanks paid him a tribute following his death, saying \"There are people who dare, who dream, and who lead others to places we would not go on our own. Jim Lovell [...] was that kind of guy.\" Interim NASA administrator Sean Duffy attributed Lovell's \"calm strength under pressure\" as having helped the Apollo 13 crew return safely to Earth.\n\n\n=== Organizations ===\nTrustee of the National Space Institute\nChairman of the National Eagle Scouts Association\nFellow in the Society of Experimental Test Pilots\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nAbout a month after the return to Earth of Apollo 13, Lovell and his crewmates, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, appeared on The Tonight Show with host Johnny Carson. In 1976, Lovell made a cameo appearance in the Nicolas Roeg film The Man Who Fell to Earth.\nLovell and Jeffrey Kluger wrote a 1994 book about the Apollo 13 mission, Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13, on which the 1995 Ron Howard film Apollo 13 was based. Lovell's first impression on being approached about the film was that Kevin Costner would be a good choice to portray him, given the physical resemblance, but Tom Hanks was cast in the role. To prepare, Hanks visited James and Marilyn Lovell at their home in Texas and flew with Lovell in his private airplane. Kathleen Quinlan was nominated for a supporting actress Oscar for her performance as Marilyn.\nIn the film, Lovell has a cameo as the captain of USS Iwo Jima. He can be seen as the naval officer shaking Hanks' hand, as Hanks speaks in voice-over, in the scene where the astronauts come aboard the Iwo Jima. The filmmakers offered to make Lovell's character an admiral aboard the ship, but Lovell said: \"I retired as a captain and a captain I will be.\" He was cast as the ship's skipper, Captain Leland Kirkemo. Along with his wife Marilyn, who also has a cameo in the film, Lovell provided a commentary track on both the single disc and the two-disc special edition DVD.\nTim Daly portrayed Lovell in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, and Pablo Schreiber played him in the 2018 film about Armstrong, First Man.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nInterview with Jim Lovell for NOVA series: To the Moon WGBH Educational Foundation, raw footage, 1998\nAppearances on C-SPAN\nJim Lovell at IMDb\nJim Lovell discography at Discogs",

        "title": "Hulk Hogan",
        "content": "Terry Gene Bollea (; August 11, 1953 – July 24, 2025), better known by his ring name Hulk Hogan, was an American professional wrestler and media personality. Hogan was widely regarded as one of the greatest and globally most recognized wrestling stars of all time. He won multiple championships worldwide, most notably being a six-time WWF Champion. He is best known for his work in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He also competed in promotions such as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), the American Wrestling Association (AWA), and  New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW).\nKnown for his showmanship, large physique, and trademark blond American Fu Manchu moustache and bandanas, Hogan began training in 1977 with Championship Wrestling from Florida and achieved global stardom after joining the WWF in 1983. His heroic, all‑American persona helped usher in the 1980s professional wrestling boom, during which he headlined eight of the first nine editions of WWF's flagship annual event WrestleMania and regularly headlined Saturday Night's Main Event. His first reign as WWF Champion lasted 1,474 days—the third-longest in the title’s history—and he became the first wrestler to win back-to-back Royal Rumbles in 1990 and 1991.\nIn 1994, Hogan joined WCW and won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship six times. His reinvention as the villainous  Hollywood Hogan and leadership of the New World Order (nWo) revitalized his career and significantly contributed to the success of the \"Monday Night War\" wrestling boom of the late 1990s, including three headline appearances at Starrcade. Hogan returned to WWF in 2002—after WWF acquired WCW—winning the Undisputed WWF Championship for a then-record-equalling sixth reign before departing in 2003. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005 and a second time in 2020 as part of the nWo.\nOutside wrestling, Hogan appeared in films such as Rocky III (1982), No Holds Barred (1989), and Suburban Commando (1991), and starred in television shows including Thunder in Paradise and Hogan Knows Best. He also fronted the Wrestling Boot Band; their sole record, Hulk Rules, reached number 12 on the Billboard Top Kid Audio chart in 1995.\nSeveral controversies damaged Hogan's public image. In 1994, he admitted to using anabolic steroids since 1976, and helping stop a wrestling unionization effort. In 2012, the internet media company Gawker published portions of a sex tape, which later had portions leak in which Hogan was heard using racial slurs. Hogan sued Gawker, which was found liable and subsequently declared bankruptcy. Despite this legal victory, Hogan's reputation has been described as \"permanently tarnished\", a view reflected in the mixed public reaction to his death in July 2025.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHogan was born in Augusta, Georgia, on August 11, 1953, the son of construction foreman Pietro \"Peter\" Bollea (December 6, 1913 – December 18, 2001) and homemaker and dance teacher Vernice \"Ruth\" (née Moody; January 16, 1920 – January 1, 2011). Hogan was of Italian, Panamanian, Scottish, and French descent; his paternal grandfather, also named Pietro, was born in 1886 in Cigliano, Province of Vercelli in Piedmont. Hogan had an older brother named Allan (1947–1986) who died at the age of 38 from a drug overdose.  When he was one and a half years old, his family moved to Port Tampa, Florida. \nAs a boy, he was a pitcher in Little League Baseball. Hogan attended Robinson High School. He began watching professional wrestling at 16 years old. While in high school, he revered Dusty Rhodes, and he regularly attended cards at the Tampa Sportatorium. It was at one of those wrestling cards where he first noticed \"Superstar\" Billy Graham and began looking to him for inspiration; since he first saw Graham on TV, Hogan wanted to match his \"inhuman\" look.\nHogan was also a musician, spending a decade playing fretless bass guitar in several Florida-based rock bands. He went on to study at Hillsborough Community College and the University of South Florida. After music gigs began to get in the way of his time in college, he dropped out of the University of South Florida. Eventually, Hogan and two local musicians formed a band called Ruckus in 1976. The band soon became popular in the Tampa Bay region. During his spare time, Hogan worked out at Hector's Gym in the Tampa Bay area, where he began lifting. Many of the wrestlers who were competing in the Florida region visited the bars where Ruckus was performing. Among those attending his performances were Jack and Gerald Brisco.\n\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1977–1979) ===\nJack and Geraldo Brisco got Hogan connected with Hiro Matsuda—the man who trained wrestlers working for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF)—to make him a potential trainee. During the first session in training, Matsuda broke Hogan's leg. After 10 weeks of rehab, Hogan returned to train with Matsuda and blocked him when he tried to break his leg again. In Hogan's professional wrestling debut, CWF promoter Eddie Graham booked him against Brian Blair in Fort Myers, Florida, on August 10, 1977. A short time later, Hogan donned a mask and assumed the persona of \"The Super Destroyer\", a hooded character previously played by Don Jardine and subsequently used by other wrestlers.\nAfter a brief career hiatus, Hogan wrestled for the Alabama-based promotion Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling (GCCW) in 1978. He formed a tag team with Ed Leslie known as The Boulder Brothers under the names Terry and Ed Boulder. During his time in Alabama, Hogan had early encounters with André the Giant, including two matches and a televised arm-wrestling contest that generated significant local interest. On May 24, 1979, Hogan wrestled his first world championship match against NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race at Rip Hewes Sports Complex in Dothan. Hogan pinned Race during the match and was briefly announced as the new champion on GCCW television. However, the NWA later overturned the decision, declaring a disqualification and nullifying the title change. Hogan went on to win the Southeastern Heavyweight Championship twice later in the year; first defeating Ox Baker, then again after regaining it from Professor Tanaka, following a brief loss to Austin Idol.\nLater that year, Hogan and Leslie joined Jerry Jarrett's Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis promotion. While in Memphis, Hogan made a talk show appearance alongside actor Lou Ferrigno, star of the television series The Incredible Hulk. The host commented that Hogan, standing 6 ft 7 in (201 cm) and weighing 295 lbs (134 kg) with 24-inch (61 cm) biceps, dwarfed Ferrigno. Inspired by this, Mary Jarrett suggested the nickname \"The Hulk,\" resulting in Hogan wrestling as Terry \"The Hulk\" Boulder. He also occasionally also performed under the name Sterling Golden.\n\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation (1979–1981) ===\n\nAccording to his autobiography My Life Outside the Ring, Bollea briefly left professional wrestling in 1979 and was working on the Tampa docks when he was spotted by Gerald Brisco. Brisco and his brother encouraged Hogan to return to wrestling and helped arrange a meeting with World Wide Wrestling Federation promoter Vince McMahon Sr. However this claim is disputed, with some wrestling historians crediting Terry Funk with recommending Hogan to McMahon Sr., having recognized his potential during Hogan's early matches. Funk, who previously appeared in the 1978 Sylvester Stallone film Paradise Alley, would also later recommend Hogan to Stallone when he appeared as Thunderlips in Rocky III.\nMcMahon was impressed with Bollea's charisma and physical stature, offered him a spot on the WWWF roster as an opponent for André the Giant. McMahon, who wanted to use an Irish name, gave him the last name Hogan, and suggested he dye his hair red.  Hogan, whose hair was already thinning, declined, quipping, \"I'll be a blond Irishman.\"   Hogan wrestled his first match in the WWWF under the ring name \"Hulk Hogan\" by defeating Harry Valdez on the November 17 episode of Championship Wrestling. He was presented as a villain in the WWWF, and was managed by \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie.\nThe next year, Hogan began a high-profile feud with André the Giant. On August 9, 1980, at Showdown at Shea, André defeated Hogan in a match.  However, Hogan notably body-slammed André during the bout, an early version of the iconic moment that would later be immortalized at WrestleMania III. They faced off again on August 30, 1980, at Madison Square Garden in a televised match with Gorilla Monsoon serving as special guest referee. Once again, Hogan managed to body-slam André, but was unsuccessful in ultimately defeating him.\n\n\n=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1980–1985) ===\n\nIn 1980, Hulk Hogan began wrestling for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he was nicknamed \"Ichiban\" (一番; \"Number One\"). by Japanese fans. He made his debut on May 13, 1980, while still under contract with the WWF, and continued to tour Japan occasionally over the next few years. During his time in NJPW, Hogan used a more technical wrestling style than the power-based approach he used in the U.S. He also used the Axe Bomber, a crooked arm lariat, as his finisher in Japan instead of the running leg drop.\nWhile still appearing for the WWF, including wrestling Pedro Morales for the Intercontinental Championship in March 26, 1981, Hogan achieved major success in Japan. On June 2, 1983, he won the inaugural International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) tournament by defeating Antonio Inoki by knockout, becoming the first holder of the original version of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Hogan also teamed with Inoki to win the MSG Tag League tournament in both 1982 and 1983. \nIn 1984, Hogan returned to NJPW to defend the IWGP title against Inoki, who had earned a title shot by winning that year's IWGP League. Hogan lost the match and therefore the title by countout after interference from Riki Choshu. During this period, Hogan also defended his WWF World Heavyweight Championship in Japan against opponents like Seiji Sakaguchi and Tatsumi Fujinami. His final match of that tour was on June 13, 1984, where he again lost to Inoki by countout in an IWGP title match. Hogan was the only IWGP champion to defend the title without winning the qualifying tournament.\n\n\n=== American Wrestling Association (1981–1983) ===\nAfter accepting a role in Rocky III, a decision that led to Vincent J. McMahon releasing him from the WWF, Hogan joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA), owned by Verne Gagne, in August 1981. He initially debuted as a villain managed by \"Luscious\" Johnny Valiant, but quickly became a fan favorite due to his charisma and popularity with the crowd. Hogan soon began feuding with the villainous Heenan Family and Nick Bockwinkel. His official turn to a hero occurred in mid-1981 during a televised segment where he saved Brad Rheingans from an attack by Jerry Blackwell. This sparked a feud with Blackwell, which Hogan eventually won, leading to his first title matches against Bockwinkel by the end of the year.\nIn March 1982, Hogan defeated Bockwinkel and his manager Bobby Heenan in a non-title handicap match in the International Amphitheatre in Chicago, Illinois. He repeatedly challenged Bockwinkel for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, with most of their matches ended in disqualification, preventing a title change. In April 1982, Hogan seemingly won the championship in St. Paul, Minnesota, but the decision was later overturned by AWA President Stanley Blackburn due to the use of a foreign object.\nHogan introduced the term \"Hulkamania\" during a May 15, 1982 appearance on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Following his role in Rocky III, \"Hulkamania\" gained widespread popularity. It was also during his time in the AWA that Hogan would first claim \"Hulkamania is running wild,\" a recurring catchphrase of his over his career.\nDespite his growing popularity, Gagne resisted making Hogan the AWA World Champion, preferring traditional wrestling over Hogan's flamboyant entertainment-driven style. Gagne later agreed to have Hogan win the title at AWA's Super Sunday event on April 24, 1983, but only if Hogan gave him the majority share of his merchandise and earnings in New Japan Pro-Wrestling.  Hogan declined, offering only a 50/50 split, and Gagne withheld the championship. Whilst Hogan still pinned Bockwinkel at Super Sunday, the decision was reversed later that night. After further unsuccessful title attempts, a storyline teased Hogan leaving the promotion. However he returned on July 31, 1983, wearing an \"American Made\" shirt and focusing on a new feud with Masa Saito.\nLater that year, Vince McMahon Jr. secretly visited Hogan in Minneapolis and offered him a leading role in the WWF. Hogan accepted and abruptly left the AWA in November 1983, reportedly sending his resignation by telegram. Gagne initially believed it was a prank until he realized Hogan was not showing up for AWA shows. In his memoir My Life Outside the Wrestling Ring, Hogan stated that he left because McMahon promised him the WWF Heavyweight Championship and a key role in expanding the company nationally.\n\n\n=== Return to WWF (1983–1993) ===\n\n\n==== Rise of Hulkamania (1983–1984) ====\nAfter purchasing the WWF from his father in 1982, Vincent K. McMahon planned to expand the company into a nationally and selected Hulk Hogan as its top star, citing his charisma and widespread recognition. Hogan returned to the WWF at a television taping in St. Louis, Missouri, on December 27, 1983, defeating Bill Dixon.\nOn the January 7, 1984 episode of Championship Wrestling, Hogan solidified his status as a fan favorite by rescuing Bob Backlund from an attack by the Wild Samoans. On January 23, 1984, Hogan won his first WWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating The Iron Sheik at Madison Square Garden, becoming the first wrestler to escape the Sheik's finishing move, the camel clutch, in the process.\nFollowing his victory, commentator Gorilla Monsoon famously declared, \"Hulkamania is here!\" Hogan quickly became the face of the WWF, referring to his fans as \"Hulkamaniacs\" and promoting his \"three demandments\": training, saying prayers, and eating vitamins. A fourth, \"believing in yourself,\" was later added during his 1990 feud with Earthquake. Hogan’s ring attire adopted a red-and-yellow color scheme, and his entrances featured him tearing his shirt, posing, and encouraging the crowd to cheer.\nHis matches during this period often followed a formula: after an initial offense, he would appear to be on the verge of defeat after being beaten down by his opponent, before “Hulking up” drawing on crowd energy to make a sudden comeback. This would be then followed by his signature sequence of moves: finger-pointing, punches, an Irish whip, the big boot and running leg drop to secure victory.\nIn 1984, similarities between Hogan and Marvel Comics’ Incredible Hulk led to a legal agreement. Titan Sports, Marvel, and Hogan signed a deal granting Marvel the trademarks to \"Hulk Hogan,\" \"Hulkster,\" and \"Hulkamania\" for 20 years. As part of the agreement, the WWF could no longer refer to Hogan as “The Incredible Hulk,” “Hulk,” or use purple and green in his presentation. Marvel also received 0.9% of Hogan-related merchandise revenue, $100 per match, and 10% of Hogan’s other earnings under the name. This agreement would carry over into Hogan's time in WCW, which by 1996 had become a sister company to Marvel rival DC Comics through their parent company Time Warner. Hogan was using the \"Hollywood Hogan\" persona at that time, avoiding potential legal conflicts. In reference to the dispute, a story in 1988's Marvel Comics Presents #45 had a panel where a wrestler resembling Hogan was tossed through an arena roof by the Incredible Hulk as he had \"picked the wrong name.\" \n\n\n==== International renown (1985–1988) ====\n\nOver the following year, Hulk Hogan became the face of professional wrestling as Vince McMahon expanded the WWF into mainstream pop culture through the Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection on MTV, This period saw large increases in viewing attendance, television ratings, and pay-per-view buys. Hogan was the main attraction at the first WrestleMania, held on March 31, 1985, where he teamed with actor and wrestler Mr. T to defeat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff.\nHogan made multiple successful title defenses throughout 1986, including against King Kong Bundy at WrestleMania 2 and Orndorff at The Big Event and Saturday Night's Main Event IX. In the fall he occasionally wrestled in tag team matches with The Machines as Hulk Machine under a mask copied from NJPW's gimmick \"Super Strong Machine\". At WrestleMania III in 1987, Hogan defended his title against André the Giant, whom the WWF promoted as undefeated in the WWF for 15 years. André turned heel by aligning with manager Bobby Heenan in the lead-up to a match at WrestleMania III, which was promoted as one of the biggest in wrestling history. At the event, Hogan successfully defended the title by body-slamming André, winning the match with a leg drop.\nHogan was named the most requested celebrity of the 1980s for the Make-a-Wish Foundation children's charity. He was featured on the covers of Sports Illustrated (the first and as of 2013, only professional wrestler to do so), TV Guide, and People magazines, while also appearing on The Tonight Show and having his own CBS Saturday morning cartoon titled Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling.  He also co-hosted Saturday Night Live on March 30, 1985. AT&T reported that the 900 number information line he ran while with the WWF was the single biggest 900 number from 1991 to 1993. Hogan continued to run a 900 number after joining World Championship Wrestling (WCW).\n\n\n==== The Mega Powers (1988–1989) ====\n\nHogan lost the WWF title to André the Giant on The Main Event I after a setup involving \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase and referee Earl Hebner, who had secretly taken the place of his identical twin brother Dave Hebner, the referee originally assigned to the match. After André delivered a  belly to belly suplex on Hogan, Earl Hebner counted the pin even though Hogan's shoulder was off the mat. After the match, André gave the title to DiBiase as part of their deal. However, WWF President Jack Tunney ruled that a title couldn't be sold and the championship was vacated.\nAt WrestleMania IV, Hogan entered a tournament to win the vacant title. He and André both got byes into the quarterfinals, but their match ended in a double disqualification. Later, Hogan helped stop André from interfering in the final match, which allowed Randy Savage to beat DiBiase and win the championship. Afterwards, Hogan, Savage, and manager Miss Elizabeth formed a partnership known as The Mega Powers, feuding with The Mega Bucks and the Twin Towers in the rest of the year.\nBy the end of 1988, the Mega Powers started a storyline where they begun to fall apart after Savage grew jealous of Hogan and suspected romantic tension between Hogan and Miss Elizabeth. At the 1989 Royal Rumble, Hogan accidentally eliminated Savage while trying to get rid of another wrestler. Soon after at The Main Event II, during a tag match against The Twin Towers Savage accidentally knocked down Elizabeth. Hogan took her backstage for help, leaving Savage alone in the ring. When Hogan returned and asked for a tag, Savage slapped him and walked out. Hogan finished the match and won on his own.\nAfter the match, Savage attacked Hogan backstage, breaking up the partnership and officially starting their feud. This culminated at WrestleMania V, where Hogan defeated Savage to win his second WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\n\n\n==== Further WWF Championship reigns and steroid scandal (1989–1993) ====\n\nDuring Hogan's second reign as champion, he starred in the film No Holds Barred, which was the inspiration of a feud with Hogan's co-star Tom Lister, Jr., who appeared at wrestling events as his film character Zeus. The duo would fight multiple times across the country during late 1989, including tag team matches at SummerSlam and at the No Holds Barred pay-per-view, with Hogan winning each match. He also won the 1990 Royal Rumble match, during which he encountered the Ultimate Warrior for the first time. \nTheir brief interaction in the match lead to a feud between the pair, culminating in Hogan losing his championship to the Warrior in a title vs title match at Wrestlemania VI. In the months following his WrestleMania VI defeat, he teased retiring after being attacked by Earthquake in a sneak attack on The Brother Love Show, but returned by SummerSlam and defeated Earthquake in a series of matches across the country.\nHogan became the first wrestler to win two Royal Rumble matches in a row after winning the 1991 Royal Rumble match. He subsequently defeated Sgt. Slaughter at  WrestleMania VII, and lost the title to The Undertaker at Survivor Series later that year following interference from Ric Flair. Hogan regained the championship at This Tuesday in Texas six days later after throwing ashes from Undertaker's urn in his face. The championship was later declared vacant due to two succeeding controversial title changes. \nIt was decided that the vacant WWF Championship would be decided in the 1992 Royal Rumble match. During the match, Hogan was eliminated by Sid Justice, who in turn Hogan helped Flair to eliminate, leading to Flair's victory. At WrestleMania VIII, Hogan defeated Sid via disqualification due to interference by Sid's manager Harvey Wippleman. During this time, news sources began to allege that George Zahorian, a doctor for the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, had been selling steroids illegally to WWF wrestlers, including Hogan. Amidst public scrutiny, Hogan took a leave of absence from the company in late 1992.\nHogan returned to the WWF in February 1993, helping his friend Brutus Beefcake in his feud with Money Inc. Renaming themselves The Mega-Maniacs, at WrestleMania IX Hogan and Beefcake lost by disqualification to Money Inc. in a match for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Later that night, Hogan won his fifth WWF Championship by pinning Yokozuna in an impromptu match only moments after Yokozuna had defeated Bret Hart for the championship. Hogan reportedly used his influence to have the finish of WrestleMania changed the weekend of the event so he would be champion during an upcoming international and de facto farewell tour. WWF Official Bruce Prichard has said in interviews Hogan was made champion to help ticket sales for a WWF tour of Europe.\nAt the first annual King of the Ring pay-per-view on June 13, Hogan lost the WWF Championship to Yokozuna after Hogan was blinded by a fireball shot by Harvey Wippleman disguised as a \"Japanese photographer\". This was Hogan's last WWF pay-per-view appearance until 2002; after continuing his feud on the international house show circuit with Yokozuna until August 1993, Hogan sat out the rest of his contract which expired later that year.\nBefore he lost the belt to Yokozuna, on May 3, 1993, Hogan returned to NJPW as WWF Champion and defeated IWGP Heavyweight Champion The Great Muta at Wrestling Dontaku. Hogan also wrestled The Hell Raisers with Muta and Masahiro Chono as his tag team partners. His last match in Japan was on January 4, 1994, at Battlefield, when he defeated Tatsumi Fujinami.\n\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling (1994–2000) ===\n\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion (1994–1996) ====\n\nStarting in March 1994, Hogan began making appearances on World Championship Wrestling (WCW) television, with interviewer Gene Okerlund visiting him on the set of Thunder in Paradise episodes. On June 11, 1994, Hogan officially signed with WCW in a ceremony that was held at Disney-MGM Studios. He was managed by Jimmy Hart. The next month, Hogan made his in-ring debut at Bash at the Beach defeating Ric Flair to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. His arrival was seen as a turning point for the company, bringing mainstream attention, increased pay-per-view sales, and new sponsorships.\nAfterwards Hogan continued feuding with Flair and later faced other top stars like The Butcher and Vader over the World Championship. He also reunited with Randy Savage, reforming the Mega Powers in WCW.\nIn September 1995, Hogan headlined the debut episode of WCW Monday Nitro, marking the beginning of the Monday Night Wars with WWF. He began wearing all black and feuded with The Dungeon of Doom, leading to a WarGames match at Fall Brawl where Hogan's team claimed victory. His 469-day title reign, the longest in the title's history, ended at Halloween Havoc after a disqualification loss to The Giant. The title was allowed to change hands under such circumstances due to a previously-agreed contract clause, but the controversy lead to the title being vacated. Hogan was unsuccessful in reclaiming the title at World War III, but would end his feud with The Giant with a cage match victory at SuperBrawl VI. In early 1996, he and Savage formed a team to battle The Alliance to End Hulkamania, defeating them at Uncensored in a Doomsday Cage match.\n\n\n==== New World Order and final years in WCW (1996–2000) ====\n\nAt Bash at the Beach 1996, Hulk Hogan turned heel for the first time in nearly fifteen years by attacking Randy Savage and aligning with The Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall), cutting a promo afterwards in which he announced the formation of the New World Order (nWo). Rebranding himself as \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, he adopted a new black-and-white persona and dominated WCW, capturing his second WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Hog Wild on August 10 by defeating The Giant for the title. He briefly lost the title to Lex Luger on the August 4, 1997, episode of Nitro,  only to regain it five days later at Road Wild. Meanwhile, a lengthy storyline between Sting and the nWo reached its pinnacle at Starrcade on December 28, where Sting defeated Hogan to win the championship in a controversial finish.\nA feud with fellow nWo members Kevin Nash and Randy Savage led to the group's split into \"nWo Hollywood\" led by Hogan and \"nWo Wolfpac\" led by Nash; Hogan defeated Savage to win his fourth WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the April 20, 1998, episode of Nitro. He lost the title to the then-undefeated Bill Goldberg on the July 6, 1998 episode of Nitro. After this, he spent the rest of 1998 in high-profile celebrity matches at various WCW PPVs, involving the likes of Dennis Rodman, Karl Malone (Bash at the Beach), and Jay Leno (Road Wild). Hogan also had a critically panned rematch with The Warrior at Halloween Havoc on October 25, where his nephew Horace aided his victory. In late 1998, he announced a presidential run and retirement from wrestling,  which were later revealed as publicity stunts derived from Jesse Ventura's recent Minnesota gubernatorial win.\n\nHogan returned to WCW in January 1999 during the infamous \"Fingerpoke of Doom\" match, where he reclaimed the WCW title from Kevin Nash via a simple poke to Nash's chest, with the pair afterwards reunifying the nWo factions. The incident is widely seen as a key factor in WCW’s decline in ratings and popularity. Later that year in March, he lost the title to Ric Flair at Uncensored and returned as a babyface in July, defeating Savage to win his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the July 12 episode of Nitro. On August 9, Hogan defeated Nash at Road Wild to retain the championship. At Fall Brawl Hogan lost the title to Sting. In the rematch at Halloween Havoc, Hogan came to the ring in street clothes, laid down for the pin, and left the ring. Hogan was convinced shortly after by head booker Vince Russo to take time off.\nHogan returned in June 2000, feuding with the cruiserweight Billy Kidman, culminating in a match at The Great American Bash. Their feud had a negative reception, being voted as the worst feud of the year by readers of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. At Bash at the Beach on July 9, 2000,  Hogan was involved in a controversial segment. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, however before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo. The match ending was changed to a worked shoot where Jarrett laid down for Hogan, with Hogan after winning, disparaging Russo and the company on the microphone. Moments later, Russo came to the ring and said this would be \"the last time fans would ever see that piece of shit in a WCW ring\" whilst revealing Hogan's creative control clause in his contract.\nAs a result, Hogan filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Russo, which was eventually dismissed in 2002. Russo claims the entire incident was a work, and Hogan claimed that Russo had turned it into a shoot when Russo went into the ring. WCW President Eric Bischoff agreed with Hogan's side of the story, saying he and Hogan celebrated after the event over the success of the angle, but that Russo coming out to fire Hogan was unplanned. Regardless, the incident marked Hogan's final appearance in WCW.\nIn the months afterwards, in March 2001 Hogan underwent surgery on his knees, wrestling in a match for Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF) in November 2001 in preparation for his return to the WWF in February 2002.\n\n\n=== Second return to WWF/WWE (2002–2003) ===\n\nAt No Way Out on February 17, 2002, Hogan returned to the WWF as a heel, reuniting with Scott Hall and Kevin Nash as the original nWo. The group attacked The Rock and cost Stone Cold Steve Austin a chance at becoming the Undisputed WWF Champion, which lead to them feuding with both Austin and The Rock. This resulted in a match between Hogan and The Rock at WrestleMania X8 on March 17. Although Hogan entered as a heel, the crowd supported him and cheered him heavily. After losing the match, Hogan shook hands with The Rock and turned face, distancing himself from the nWo.\nFollowing WrestleMania, Hogan revived his red and yellow \"Hulkamania\" persona, though he initially kept elements of his \"Hollywood\" character such as his blonde mustache and black beard combination. On the March 25 episode of Raw, he was drafted to the SmackDown! brand,  where he began a feud with Triple H. Hogan defeated him at Backlash on April 21 to win the Undisputed WWF Championship, becoming the final WWF Champion before the company was renamed WWE in May 2002.\n\nHogan lost the title to The Undertaker at Judgment Day  on May 19. He later feuded with Kurt Angle, losing to him by submission at King of the Ring on June 23; notably the first time Hogan had lost by submission in WWE. He also briefly held the WWE Tag Team Championship with Edge for 19 days. Hogan was also notably defeated by Brock Lesnar by technical submission on the August 8 episode of SmackDown!. \nAfter his loss to Lesnar, Hogan went on a brief hiatus before returning in early 2003, dropping the remaining components of his \"Hollywood\" persona.  He faced The Rock again at No Way Out on February 23, losing the match. At  WrestleMania XIX on March 30, Hogan defeated Vince McMahon in a street fight billed as \"20 years in the making.\" Following this, Hogan adopted a masked alter ego named Mr. America  after McMahon tried to force him out of the WWE. Despite McMahon's attempts to prove Mr. America's identity, the masked wrestler continued to appear through May and June, including a victory over \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper at Judgment Day. Mr. America's final appearance was on the June 26 episode of SmackDown! in a six-man tag team match. The following week, Hogan quit WWE due to creative frustrations, unhappy with the payoffs for his matches after his comeback under the Mr. America gimmick.  On the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, McMahon aired footage of Hogan unmasking after the June 26 episode of SmackDown! and \"fired\" him on-screen, though Hogan had already left the company.\n\n\n=== Second return to NJPW (2003) ===\nHogan returned to NJPW in October 2003, when he defeated Masahiro Chono at Ultimate Crush II in the Tokyo Dome. Shortly after Hogan left WWE, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) began making overtures to Hogan, culminating in Jeff Jarrett, co-founder of TNA and then NWA World Heavyweight Champion, launching an on-air attack on Hogan in Japan after the Chono match. The attack was supposed to be a precursor to Hogan battling Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's first three-hour pay-per-view. Due to recurring knee and hip problems, Hogan did not appear in TNA.\n\n\n=== Third return to WWE (2005–2007) ===\n\nOn April 2, 2005, Hulk Hogan was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2005 by Sylvester Stallone. The following night at WrestleMania 21, Hogan made a surprise appearance to save Eugene from an attack from Muhammad Hassan and Khosrow Daivari. The lead-up to his induction and WrestleMania appearance was featured in the first season of Hogan Knows Best. At Backlash, Hogan teamed with Shawn Michaels to defeat Hassan and Daivari. Hogan and Michaels were later victorious in a match on the July 4 episode of Raw against Carlito and Kurt Angle, after which Michaels turned on Hogan. This led to a match at SummerSlam on August 21, where Hogan defeated Michaels. The two made up after the match, shaking hands.\n\nBefore WrestleMania 22 in 2006, Hogan inducted Gene Okerlund into the WWE Hall of Fame. He returned at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII  alongside Brooke Hogan, where he was attacked by Randy Orton. Hogan later defeated Orton at SummerSlam. This marked Hogan’s final WWE match, despite later talks of a potential bout with John Cena at WrestleMania 25 which ultimately fell through.\n\n\n=== Independent circuit (2007, 2009) ===\n\nDuring this time Hogan was invited to join Memphis Wrestling to face Jerry Lawler. Although the match had been promoted for months, contractual obligations prevented Lawler from participating, and he was replaced by Paul Wight. Hogan defeated Wight at the PMG Clash of Legends event on April 27, 2007.\nThroughout November 2009, Hogan performed in an independent wrestling tour across Australia titled Hulkamania: Let The Battle Begin. The main event of each show was a rematch between Hogan and Ric Flair, with Hogan winning each match.\n\n\n=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2009–2013) ===\n\nOn October 27, 2009, it was announced that Hogan had signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Hogan debuted on the January 4, 2010, episode of Impact! alongside Eric Bischoff in an executive role. Over the next few weeks, Hogan began an on-screen mentorship with Abyss,  and the two teamed to defeat A.J. Styles and Ric Flair in Hogan's first TNA match on the March 8 episode of Impact!.  At Lockdown on April 18, Team Hogan (Hogan, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam) defeated Team Flair (Flair, Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) in a Lethal Lockdown match.\nAfter months of storylines involving speculation about a secretive controlling force in TNA, Hogan turned heel by helping Hardy win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory on October 10, 2010, forming Immortal with Hardy, Bischoff, Abyss and Jarrett. As part of the angle, it was revealed that Bischoff had tricked TNA President Dixie Carter into signing paperwork to turn the company over to him and Hogan. The storyline concluded at Bound for Glory on October 16, 2011, when Hogan lost to Sting in a match that returned control of TNA to Carter. After the match, Hogan aided Sting during a post-match attack by members of Immortal, marking his return to a fan favorite role.\n\nHogan wrestled his final matches during TNA's tour of the United Kingdom, on January 26 and 27, 2012, at house shows in Nottingham and Manchester, where he, James Storm and Sting defeated Bobby Roode, Bully Ray and Kurt Angle in a six-man tag team main event at both events. Two months later, Hogan assumed the role of TNA's on-screen General Manager. His last major storyline in TNA was with the mysterious masked group Aces & Eights; the storyline included an angle where Bully Ray was in a relationship with his daughter Brooke, culminating at Lockdown on March 10, 2013, where Ray was revealed to be the leader of Aces & Eights. Hogan left TNA in October 2013 upon the expiration of his contract. His final appearance was on the October 3 episode of Impact Wrestling.\n\n\n=== Fourth return to WWE (2014–2015) ===\n\nHogan returned to WWE in early 2014, appearing on Raw to promote the WWE Network on February 24, and alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Joe Manganiello on March 24. During WrestleMania XXX, Hogan served as the host, making several appearances throughout the night.\nWWE honored Hogan's career during a live event at Madison Square Garden dubbed \"Hulk Hogan Appreciation Night\" with a special commemorative banner hanging from the rafters on February 27, 2015. The following month, he appeared on the March 23 episode of Raw in a segment with Snoop Dogg and Curtis Axel. Hogan posthumously inducted \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015 three days later. The next night at WrestleMania 31, Hogan, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, representing the nWo, interfered in the Sting–Triple H match on behalf of Sting, where they battled D-Generation X (DX) members Billy Gunn, X-Pac, Road Dogg, and Shawn Michaels.\n\n\n==== Racism scandal and departure ====\nIn July 2015, National Enquirer and Radar Online publicized an anti-black rant made by Hogan on a leaked sex tape recorded in 2007. In the recording, he is heard expressing disgust with the notion of his daughter dating a black man, referenced by repeated use of the racial slur \"nigger\". Hogan also said that he was \"a racist, to a point\". Once the recordings went public erupting in a media scandal, Hogan apologized for the remarks, which he said is \"language that is offensive and inconsistent with [his] own beliefs\". Radar Online later reported that Hogan had also used homophobic slurs on the leaked sex tape. It was also reported that Hogan had used racist language in a 2008 call to his then-imprisoned son, Nick, and also said that he hoped they would not be reincarnated as black males.\nOn July 24, WWE terminated their contract with Hogan; however, Hogan's lawyer said Hogan chose to resign. In response to the scandal, WWE removed almost all references to Hogan from their website, including his entry from its WWE Hall of Fame page and his merchandise from WWE Shop. Hogan’s characters were removed from WWE video games, Mattel halted production of his action figures, and retailers including Target, Toys \"R\" Us, and Walmart pulled his merchandise from their online stores.\nHogan gave an interview with Good Morning America on August 31 in which he pleaded forgiveness for his racist comments, attributing these to a racial bias inherited from his neighborhood while growing up. Hogan said that the term \"nigger\" was used liberally among friends in Tampa; former neighbors disputed this.\n\n\n===== Reaction from African-American wrestlers =====\nThe scandal spurred a range of responses from across the professional wrestling industry. Hogan received some support from his African-American peers. Virgil,  Dennis Rodman and Kamala each spoke positively about their experiences with Hogan and did not believe he was racist. Other black wrestlers working in the WWE made more critical comments, including Mark Henry, who said he was pleased by WWE's \"no tolerance approach to racism\" response and that he was hurt and offended by Hogan's manner and tone. Booker T said he was shocked and called the statements unfortunate. In the time that followed, numerous African-Americans associated with wrestling expressed some level of support for Hogan including: Rodman, The Rock, Booker T Kamala, Virgil, Mr. T, Henry, and Big E.\nHogan returned to the WWE in 2018, and apologized to WWE wrestlers in a backstage statement. Several African-American wrestlers, including The New Day, Titus O'Neil, Mark Henry, Shelton Benjamin and JTG doubted the sincerity of Hogan's apology, due to Hogan warning wrestlers to be \"mindful about being recorded without their knowledge\" during his apology instead of addressing his comments.\n\n\n=== Fifth return to WWE (2018–2025) ===\nOn July 15, 2018, Hogan was \"reinstated\" into the WWE Hall of Fame, despite no prior official statement suspending him. Vince McMahon stated, \"I knew he wasn’t racist. ... He said some racist things. He should pay for that, and he did.\" Hogan made his on-screen return on November 2, 2018, as the host of Crown Jewel. On January 7, 2019, Hogan returned to Raw to present a tribute to Gene Okerlund, who had died five days prior.\nDuring the following years, Hogan appeared on several WWE events, like the 2019 and 2020 Hall of Fame ceremonies, where he inducted Brutus Beefcake in 2019 and was inducted for a second time as part of the New World Order (with Scott Hall, Kevin Nash and Sean Waltman) in 2020. He also hosted the 35 and 37 editions of WrestleMania, along with Alexa Bliss and Titus O'Neil respectively. He also participated at Crown Jewel 2019, where he was the captain of a team opposing Ric Flair's team. In January 2025, Hogan made his final appearance at a professional wrestling event during the Raw debut on Netflix, where alongside Jimmy Hart he cut a promo advertising his Real American Beer. Hogan was heavily booed by the crowd, which received widespread coverage in the media.\n\n\n== Endorsements and business ventures ==\n\n\n=== Food, beverage, restaurants and wrestling shops ===\n\nHogan created and financed a restaurant called Pastamania located in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. It opened on the Labor Day weekend of 1995 and was heavily promoted on WCW's live show Monday Nitro.

A second store was opened in New York City in 2024, and a third opened in Pigeon Forge in 2025, shortly before his death.\nIn 2024, Hogan launched Real American Beer, a light beer brand.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nIn 2008, Hogan endorsed Barack Obama for president. In 2011, He recanted his endorsement after Obama used Hogan's \"Real American\" theme song without his permission during that year's White House Correspondents' Dinner. Hogan endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 United States presidential election. In the leadup to the  2016 United States presidential election, Hogan said he wanted to be Donald Trump's pick for Vice president.\nHogan formally endorsed Trump for president at the 2024 Republican National Convention. He also spoke at the 2024 Trump rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nIn October 2007, Hogan transferred all trademarks referring to himself to his liability company named Hogan Holdings Limited. The trademarks include Hulk Hogan, \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, Hulkster, Hogan Knows Grillin, Hulkamania.com, and Hulkapedia.com.\nIn April 2008, Hogan announced that he would license Gameloft to create a Hulkamania Wrestling video game for mobile phones. In 2010, Hogan starred alongside Troy Aikman in commercials for Rent-A-Center. On March 24, 2011, Hogan made an appearance on American Idol, surprising Paul McDonald and James Durbin, who were both wrestling fans. On October 15, 2010, Endemol Games UK announced Hulk Hogan's Hulkamania, an online gambling game featuring video footage of Hogan.\nIn October 2013, Hogan partnered with Tech Assets, Inc. to open a web hosting service called Hostamania.

Early in his career Hogan played the part of Thunderlips in Rocky III (1982). He also appeared in No Holds Barred (1989), before starring in family films Suburban Commando (1991), Mr. Nanny (1993), Santa with Muscles (1996), and 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain (1998).

Eric Bischoff was also listed as an executive producer. The characters were considered for a regular series, but instead received a second feature-length showcase two years later, called Assault on Death Mountain.\nIn 1995, he appeared on TBN's Kids Against Crime. Hogan made cameo appearances in Muppets from Space, Gremlins 2: The New Batch (the theatrical cut) and Spy Hard as himself. Hogan played the role of Zeus in Little Hercules in 3D. Hogan made two appearances on The A-Team in 1985 and 1986, along with Roddy Piper. He appeared on Suddenly Susan in 1999.\nHogan voiced \"The Dean\" in the 2011 animated show China, IL.\n\n\n=== Reality television and hosting ===\nIn July 2005, VH1 premiered Hogan Knows Best a reality show which centered around Hogan, his then-wife Linda, and their children Brooke and Nick. In July 2008, a spin-off entitled Brooke Knows Best premiered, which focused primarily on Hogan's daughter Brooke.\nIn 2008, Hogan hosted the comeback series of American Gladiators on NBC. He also hosted and judged the short-lived reality show, Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling. Hogan had a special titled Finding Hulk Hogan on A&E on November 17, 2010.\nIn 2015, Hogan was a judge on the sixth season of Tough Enough, alongside Paige and Daniel Bryan, but due to that year's Hogan scandal, he was replaced by The Miz.\n\n\n=== Music and radio ===\n\nHogan released a music CD, Hulk Rules, as Hulk Hogan and the Wrestling Boot Band, which also included Jimmy \"Mouth of the South\" Hart, his then-wife Linda and J.J Maguire. Despite negative reviews, Hulk Rules reached No. 12 on the Billboard Top Kid Audio chart in 1995. One of the songs, Hulkster in Heaven, was purportedly written about murder victim James Bulger.\nHogan and Green Jellÿ in 1993 performed a cover version of Gary Glitter's song \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\". In the 1980s, Hogan appeared in the music video for Dolly Parton's wrestling-themed love song \"Headlock on My Heart\" for Parton's show Dolly.\nHogan was a regular guest on Bubba the Love Sponge's radio show. He also served as the best man at Bubba's January 2007 wedding. On March 12, 2010, Hogan hosted his own radio show titled Hogan Uncensored, on Sirius Satellite Radio's Howard 101.\n\n\n=== Merchandising ===\nThe Wrestling Figure Checklist records Hogan as having 171 different action figures, produced between the 1980s and 2010s from numerous manufacturers and promotions.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nHogan provided his voice for the 2011 game Saints Row: The Third as Angel de la Muerte, a member of the Saints. In October 2011, he released a video game called Hulk Hogan's Main Event.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Legal issues ===\n\n\n==== Belzer lawsuit ====\n\nOn March 27, 1985, Richard Belzer requested on his cable TV talk show Hot Properties that Hogan demonstrate one of his signature wrestling moves. Hogan put Belzer in a modified guillotine choke, which caused Belzer to pass out. When Hogan released him, Belzer hit his head on the floor, sustaining a laceration to the scalp that required a brief hospitalization. Belzer sued Hogan for $5 million and later settled out of court. In 2006, it was claimed that the settlement totaled $5 million, half from Hogan and half from Vince McMahon. However, Belzer suggested that the settlement amount was closer to $400,000.\n\n\n==== Testimony in McMahon trial ====\n\nIn 1991, on The Arsenio Hall Show, Hogan denied using steroids, stating \"I trained 20 years two hours a day to look like I do. But the things that I'm not, I am not a steroid abuser and I do not use steroids.\" Billy Graham, a fellow wrestler, in a 1991 interview on Inside Edition, stated that he injected Hogan with steroids in the 80's. In 1993, media reports indicated that Hogan was a heavy steroid user.\nIn 1994, Hogan, having received legal immunity, testified in the trial of Vince McMahon relating to shipments of steroids received by both parties from WWF physician George T. Zahorian III. Under oath, Hogan admitted that he had used anabolic steroids since 1976 to gain size and weight, but that McMahon had neither sold him the drugs nor ordered him to take them. The evidence given by Hogan proved extremely costly to the government's case against McMahon. Due to this and jurisdictional issues, McMahon was found not guilty.\nDuring his testimony, Hogan said that he and King Kong Bundy had gone to McMahon to tip him off over Jesse Ventura's unionization efforts in 1986. Hogan later stated \"Vince already knew about it, I just said I didn't think it was a good idea. [Ventura] was running his mouth like usual, trying to get everyone on board, everyone knew\". This led to criticism; no professional wrestlers' union has been established.\n\n\n==== Sexual assault allegation and extortion lawsuit ====\nIn January 1996, Hogan was accused of sexual assault by a 29-year-old businesswoman on Labor Day weekend in 1995, at the first WCW Nitro taping at the Mall of America in Minneapolis. Gene Okerlund claimed he was with Hogan the whole day and denied the allegations. The woman and her lawyer sent Hogan a letter agreeing to settle the case financially before making it public, and Hogan sued for extortion. The woman filed a counter-suit against Hogan in 1997.\n\n\n==== Gawker lawsuit ====\n\nIn 2012, Gawker released a short clip of a sex tape between Hogan and Heather Clem, the estranged wife of radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge. Hogan stated that the tape was made without his knowledge or consent, and he sued Bubba and Heather Clem for invading his privacy on October 15, 2012. A settlement with Bubba was announced later that month, who subsequently issued a public apology. In lawsuit financed by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, Hogan also sued Gawker for $100 million for defamation, loss of privacy, and emotional pain. In 2015, clips from the tape with Hogan using slurs led to Hogan departing WWE.\nAfter a 2016 trial, Hogan was awarded $115 million. Also, on August 11, 2016, a Florida judge gave Hogan control of the assets of A. J. Daulerio, former Gawker editor-in-chief, who was involved in the posting of Hogan's sex tape. Gawker ultimately reached a $31 million settlement with Hogan in November 2016.\n\n\n=== Alleged fabrications ===\nHogan was accused multiple times of fabricating elements of his past. The Independent called Hogan \"a great believer in self-mythologising\". According to The Independent, Hogan claimed that Elvis Presley was a big fan of his, although Presley died before Hogan's rise in popularity. Hogan once claimed that the \"difference in time zones\" flying between the US and Japan caused him to wrestle \"400 days in a single year\". \nAfter Survivor Series in 1991, he accused The Undertaker of injuring his neck with a Tombstone piledriver. The Undertaker later denied injuring Hogan, stating he had performed the move safely. In 2009, Hogan claimed that both the Rolling Stones and Metallica wanted him to play bass guitar for them. Metallica singer James Hetfield denied Hogan's claim. Hogan also claimed that he turned down advances from both Cher and Madonna. \nIn 2014, Hogan claimed that a missed phone call resulted in him missing an opportunity to endorse what became the George Foreman Grill. Foreman's son later said Hogan wasn't considered. In 2010, Hogan said that he was offered the starring role in the film The Wrestler but turned it down. Director Darren Aronofsky later said he never considered Hogan. Hogan claimed in a radio interview to have a 10-inch (25 cm) penis, however, during the Gawker trial, he admitted this was not true, stating he was speaking in character.\n\n\n=== Family ===\n\nIn 1983, Hogan married his first wife, Linda Claridge. They had two children: a daughter, Brooke, and a son, Nick. On November 20, 2007, Linda filed for divorce, stating publicly that she decided to end her marriage after discovering that Hogan had an affair. Hogan denied ever cheating on Linda, and stated if he could change one thing in his life it would be to \"get divorced right after Nick was born\". In the divorce settlement, Hogan retained around 30% of the couple's liquid assets, totaling around $10 million. Hogan said he contemplated suicide after the divorce and credited American Gladiators co-star Laila Ali with preventing it.\nHogan began a relationship with Jennifer McDaniel in early 2008. The two were engaged in November 2009 and married on December 14, 2010, in Clearwater, Florida. The couple divorced in 2021.\nHogan became engaged to yoga instructor Sky Daily in July 2023, proposing to her at actor Corin Nemec's wedding reception. They married on September 22, 2023.\nThrough Brooke, Hogan would have two grandchildren who were born in January 2025. However, he would not meet them by the time of his death in July 2025.\n\n\n=== Religious beliefs ===\nHogan was public about his Christian faith, stating that he was \"saved\" at the age of 14 and had \"leaned on\" his religion throughout his life. Hogan attributed his salvation to the Youth Ranches of Hank Lindstrom, where he would specifically emphasize John 3:16 and salvation by faith alone. He and his wife, Sky Daily, were baptized at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Largo, Florida on December 20, 2023. However, his wife Sky's family are Scientologists, which contributed to Hogan's daughter Brooke distancing herself from the family due to fear of the church's litigious nature.\n\n\n=== Health problems ===\nHogan suffered numerous health problems, particularly with his back, since retiring as a wrestler following years of heavy weight-training and jolting as a wrestler. He underwent at least 25 medical procedures, including back surgeries, and knee and hip replacements.\nAfter the procedures failed to cure his back problems, Hogan underwent traditional spinal fusion surgery in December 2010, which enabled him to return to his professional activities. In January 2013, Hogan filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Laser Spine Institute for $50 million, saying that the medical firm persuaded him to undergo a half-dozen \"unnecessary and ineffective\" spinal operations that worsened his back problems. He claimed that the six procedures he underwent over a period of 19 months only gave him short-term relief. In addition, the Laser Spine Institute used his name on their advertisements, which Hogan claimed was without his permission. The Laser Spine Institute shut down in 2019.\nIn July 2025, Brooke Hogan stated that Hogan's health was declining by 2023, and that he had undergone numerous surgeries by this point in time.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn May 14, 2025, Hogan underwent a four-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion operation. During the procedure, Hogan's phrenic nerve, which helps the diaphragm contract and expand to allow the lungs to inhale and exhale air, was severed. Close friends Jimmy Hart and Eric Bischoff noted a rapid decline in Hogan's health following his neck fusion surgery. Hart shared that Hogan avoided visitors to prevent infection, while Bischoff recalled Hogan sounding weak and expressing embarrassment over his condition. On June 18, 2025, radio host Bubba the Love Sponge reported that Hogan was seriously ill in the hospital and \"might not make it\".\nHogan died at his Clearwater, Florida, home on the morning of July 24, 2025, at the age of 71. He collapsed while doing therapy after returning home from the hospital, and was taken by paramedics to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 11:17 AM. His official cause of death was acute myocardial infarction, known as a heart attack. His medical records later revealed he had been battling chronic lymphocytic leukemia and atrial fibrillation.\nOn August 5, 2025, Hogan's first funeral service was held at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Largo, Florida with widow Sky Daily, ex-wife Linda Hogan, Vince McMahon, Triple H, Stephanie McMahon, Ric Flair, Dennis Rodman, Kid Rock, Theo Von, and Bam Margera among those in attendance. Daughter Brooke, who was estranged from her father since 2023, did not attend his funeral services. Following another funeral service which was held at Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park & Funeral Home in Clearwater, Florida, Hogan was cremated and laid to rest.\n\n\n== Tributes and legacy ==\n\nHogan has been described as one of the largest attractions in professional wrestling history and a major reason why Vince McMahon's expansion of his promotion worked. Wrestling historian and journalist Dave Meltzer stated that \"...You can't possibly overrate his significance in the history of the business. And he sold more tickets to wrestling shows than any man who ever lived\". Hogan himself had previously said he is the second-greatest wrestler ever, after Ric Flair, although Chris Jericho has stated that Hogan is a better worker than Flair and that working with him was one of the favorite moments of Jericho’s career. Meanwhile, Cody Rhodes has said numerous times that Hogan's WrestleMania X8 match with The Rock is the greatest match in wrestling history and that it epitomized what professional wrestling is. Bret Hart has issued both praise and criticism for Hogan, lauding his look and describing him as a \"hero\" to both fans and fellow wrestlers, but calling his in-ring abilities \"very limited.\"\nFollowing Hogan's death on July 24, 2025, many wrestlers paid tribute to Hogan on social media, such as Vince McMahon, The Rock, The Undertaker, Steve Austin, Rob Van Dam, Shawn Michaels, John Cena, Triple H, Ric Flair, Kane, Sting, Jake Roberts, Ted DiBiase Sr., Kurt Angle, The Miz, Matt Hardy and many other wrestlers. Hogan was also remembered by people outside professional wrestling, like actor Sylvester Stallone, UFC President Dana White and U.S. President Donald Trump. Ron DeSantis, governor of Hogan's home state of Florida, declared August 1 as Hulk Hogan Day and ordered flags at the Florida State Capitol flown at half-staff.\nWWE honored Hogan with multiple tributes: first on the July 25 episode of SmackDown, then on the following episodes of Raw and NXT, and also at SummerSlam. Meanwhile, TNA dedicated its July 24 episode of Impact! to Hogan. In NJPW, Hogan was given a ten-bell salute, as well as a tribute ceremony, during the sixth night of the G1 Climax 35 tournament on July 26. Two days later, Hogan was honored on AEW Collision with a tribute from former WCW commentator Tony Schiavone.\nAt the same time, many sources noted his complicated legacy due to his backstage politics, his racial comments, and his support for Donald Trump. Mark Henry, who was critical of Hogan following his racism scandal, spoke of his legacy after his death: \"Regardless of his shortcomings, it didn’t make him less of a wrestler. It didn’t make him less of an entertainer. It’s never going to take away from his greatness.\"\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBischoff, Eric (2006).

        "title": "Spider-Man: Brand New Day",
        "content": "Spider-Man: Brand New Day is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is intended to be the 38th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the fourth film in the MCU Spider-Man film series following Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). The film is being directed by Destin Daniel Cretton from a screenplay by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Sadie Sink, Liza Colón-Zayas, Jon Bernthal, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Mando, and Tramell Tillman.\nSony was developing a fourth MCU Spider-Man film by August 2019 alongside No Way Home. Producer Amy Pascal revealed in November 2021 that it was intended to be the first in a new trilogy of Holland Spider-Man films, with work on the story beginning that December. McKenna and Sommers returned as writers from the previous films by February 2023, Cretton was hired to direct by October 2024, and the title was announced in March 2025. Filming began in August 2025 with location filming in Glasgow, Scotland, while soundstage work occurs at Pinewood Studios in England.\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day is scheduled to be released in the United States on July 31, 2026, as part of Phase Six of the MCU.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:A former Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Following Dr. Stephen Strange's spell at the end of the film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), the world has forgotten that Peter is Spider-Man and he is now focused on protecting New York City from street-level crime.\nZendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson: Peter's former classmate and ex-girlfriend\nJacob Batalon as Ned Leeds: Peter's former best friend\nSadie Sink\nLiza Colón-Zayas\nJon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher:A vigilante who aims to fight the criminal underworld by any means necessary, no matter how lethal the results are. Producer Kevin Feige said the character would have a \"different tonality\" in the film compared to his previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) appearances, which lean more into his violent actions than this film's rating would allow.\nMark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk: A founding Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated\nMichael Mando as Mac Gargan / Scorpion: A criminal who was captured by Spider-Man and arrested in the film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)\nTramell Tillman\nAdditionally, Charlie Cox is expected to reprise his MCU role as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a blind lawyer with superhuman senses from Hell's Kitchen, New York, who leads a double life as a masked vigilante. He served as Peter's lawyer during the events of No Way Home.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\n==== Interest and writing delay ====\nSony Pictures was reported in August 2019 to be developing a fourth Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Spider-Man film alongside the third, Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), after they co-produced Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) with Marvel Studios and its president Kevin Feige. Later that month, Sony said it would be making No Way Home without Marvel Studios and Feige after negotiations to update the production deal between the two companies failed. Following a negative fan reaction, Sony and Marvel's parent company Disney returned to negotiations and announced a new agreement at the end of September, which allowed Marvel Studios and Feige to produce No Way Home for Sony with producer Amy Pascal. In February 2021, star Tom Holland said No Way Home was the final film in his contract with Sony and Marvel but he hoped to continue playing Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the future. Zendaya, who portrays Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson in the MCU, said in July that she did not know if another MCU Spider-Man film would be made. That October, Holland said No Way Home was being treated as the end of a franchise that began with Homecoming. He said any further MCU Spider-Man films would differ from the first trilogy and feature a tonal change.\nHolland said in November 2021 that he was unsure if he should continue making Spider-Man films and felt he would have done something wrong if he was still portraying the character in his thirties. He expressed interest in a film focusing on the Miles Morales version of Spider-Man instead of Parker. Despite this, Pascal hoped to continue working with Holland on future Spider-Man films, and said work on the first film in a new trilogy was about to begin. The Hollywood Reporter reported that Sony did not yet have official plans for further MCU Spider-Man films but the studio hoped to continue its collaboration with Marvel Studios. Holland said he did not know about plans for future Spider-Man films, but there were some \"very, very exciting things\" being discussed and he felt the franchise had a bright future. The next month, he added that he had achieved what he wanted with the character and was ready to say goodbye to the role if he did not end up starring in another film, but he would be saddened to leave the franchise. Pascal expressed her hope that the partnership between Sony and Disney would last forever, and Feige promised that it would not break down again as it did during the development of No Way Home. He said Holland's Parker would return in another MCU film at some point, and confirmed that he had begun discussing the story for the next Spider-Man film with Pascal, Sony, and Disney. This would continue from Parker's \"momentous decision\" at the end of No Way Home to make everyone forget who he is.\nBy April 2022, when series director Jon Watts exited as director of Marvel Studios' Fantastic Four film (2025), Sony was expecting Watts to return for the next Spider-Man film. A month later, Sony Pictures CEO and chairman Tom Rothman confirmed that he hoped the \"whole group\" from the previous films would return, including Watts, Holland, and Zendaya. Feige said in February 2023 that they had a story with \"big ideas\" and writers had begun work on it, but this was put on hold in May because of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. Pascal said work would resume on the film after the strike concluded. Holland said he had been involved in meetings about the film, and these had also been put on hold because of the writers' strike. He was happy with the creative reasoning that had been proposed for why a fourth film should be made, but was apprehensive about the stigma surrounding fourth films in franchises and felt they had \"hit a home run with our first franchise and there's a part of me that wants to walk away with my head held high and pass the baton\" to another actor.\n\n\n==== Restarting active work ====\nThe writers' strike ended in late September 2023, and Holland confirmed in November that discussions about the film had restarted. He stated that he would only return for a fourth film if it would \"do justice to the character\". Journalist Jeff Sneider reported in early 2024 that Marvel Studios was considering Drew Goddard and Justin Lin to direct; that Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers had returned from the prior three Spider-Man films to write the script; that Holland and Zendaya were both expected to return; and that filming was set to begin in September or October of that year, delaying filming for the third season of Euphoria (2026) to accommodate Zendaya's schedule. Variety reported in March that the script was still being worked on and there was no director or filming date set. The next month, Holland said they were giving the writers the time that they needed to work on the script following the strike. He added that he would \"always want to do Spider-Man films\" and owed his career to the franchise, but reiterated that he wanted to make sure the next film was made the right way to preserve the legacy of the previous trilogy. Holland was able to have more input on the fourth film's story because he was involved in the creative process much earlier than he was for the previous Spider-Man films. Feige said in July that a draft of the script was being submitted \"relatively soon\", and Watts may not be available to direct due to his busy schedule with other projects. Watts ultimately chose not to direct the film.\n\nAfter further work on the script, the studios began meeting with directors. Destin Daniel Cretton was the top choice to direct by September 2024 when he was in early talks. He directed the film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) for Marvel Studios and signed an overall deal with them in December 2021 that included directing a sequel to that film and developing the Disney+ series Wonder Man (2025). Cretton was also hired to direct the MCU crossover film Avengers: The Kang Dynasty in July 2022, but stepped down in November 2023 due to schedule delays. That film was subsequently reworked into Avengers: Doomsday (2026). The fourth Spider-Man film was said to be the priority for Marvel Studios over a sequel to Shang-Chi. Also in September 2024, McKenna and Sommers were confirmed to be writing the film, Holland and Zendaya were reportedly in talks to return, and filming was expected to begin in early 2025. Sneider reported a planned release date in 2026 and questioned the extent of Zendaya's role compared to the previous Spider-Man films due to her busy schedule in 2025 filming Euphoria's third season and the film Dune: Part Three (2026). In October, Holland said he was excited after reading a draft of the script with Zendaya, though he felt it still needed work. He said one of the challenges was fitting into the overall plan for the MCU and described the schedule needed for this as \"a tall order but definitely achievable with the fantastic people we have working on it now\". He said filming would begin in mid-2025, working around his commitments to Doomsday and the film The Odyssey (2026). Zendaya no longer needed to work around the filming of Dune: Part Three, which had been delayed to early 2026. Soon after Holland's comments, he and Cretton were confirmed to have signed on for the fourth Spider-Man film. It was scheduled for release on July 24, 2026.\nBy November 2024, it was again unclear if Zendaya would reprise her role after she joined Holland in The Odyssey. Sneider reported that filming was not expected to begin until late 2025 or early 2026 and there was potential for the release date to be delayed until 2027 as a result, in part because Sony did not plan to release it the same year as the animated film Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, which was expected to be ready for a 2026 release at that point; Beyond the Spider-Verse was later scheduled for release in 2027. In December, Sneider further reported that Zendaya's role had been \"severely reduced\" due to her schedule, with filming set to take place from June to October 2025 between the filming schedules for Euphoria's third season and Dune: Part Three. He also reported that Charlie Cox was slated to reprise his role as Matt Murdock / Daredevil from No Way Home and other MCU media; alien symbiotes were included in the script; a new group of Parker's classmates would be introduced; and Sacha Baron Cohen was expected to appear as Mephisto, reprising his role from the series finale of the Disney+ miniseries Ironheart (2025).\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2025, filming was confirmed to be beginning in mid-2025 in London, and the release date was pushed back a week to July 31, 2026, to distance it from the release of The Odyssey earlier that month. Variety reported that it was still unclear whether Zendaya would be returning for the film, while Deadline Hollywood reported that she would but her deal had not been finalized. Sadie Sink was cast in a significant role in March, following rumors that she could portray the X-Men member Jean Grey in the MCU. At Sony's CinemaCon panel at the end of the month, Holland and Cretton announced the title as Spider-Man: Brand New Day, derived from the 2008 comic book storyline \"Brand New Day\". Holland described the film as a \"fresh start\" following the ending of No Way Home. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon were expected to return, with Batalon reprising his MCU role as Ned Leeds, while Sneider reported that the film would take place concurrently with the events of Doomsday and he did not expect Holland to appear in the latter as a result. Liza Colón-Zayas joined the cast in May.\nZendaya and Batalon were confirmed to be returning in June 2025, but the extent of their roles was unclear. Filming was revealed to be beginning that August. Additionally, Jon Bernthal was revealed to be reprising his MCU role of Frank Castle / Punisher in the film. Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter said the addition of Bernthal indicated that Brand New Day could have a more grounded story due to the Punisher's characterization and background, and questioned how his violent nature would translate into the family-friendly Spider-Man property. Feige confirmed Bernthal's role a month later. He said the ending of No Way Home was a promise to audiences that they would see Holland as a \"proper Spider-Man\" for the first time, with the character on his own and fighting street-level crime in New York City rather than dealing with \"world-ending events\". Because of this, Marvel wanted to include other street-level heroes in the film that Holland's Spider-Man had not interacted with before, such as the Punisher. Feige noted that the latter was introduced in a Spider-Man comic, specifically The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 1 #129 (1974). He said Cretton had eight or nine comic book covers on the art department wall, which he was planning to recreate in the film, seemingly including the cover of The Amazing Spider-Man #129. Costume designer Sanja Milkovic Hays returned from No Way Home and other MCU films. Charles Wood returned as production designer from previous MCU media.\nFollowing rumors that Mark Ruffalo would be reprising his MCU role as Bruce Banner / Hulk in the film, his casting was confirmed with the start of filming in August 2025. Aaron Couch and Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter said Ruffalo's role in the film had only \"firmed up\" as the script came together in the lead-up to filming. They noted that the previous MCU Spider-Man films each featured a major MCU co-star—Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man in Homecoming, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in Far From Home, and Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange in No Way Home—as part of Sony and Marvel Studios' special agreement, and compared this to the Marvel Team-Up comic books which feature Spider-Man teaming-up with different heroes. They felt Brand New Day was \"stacking the deck\" by featuring both Bernthal and Ruffalo. The latter made a cameo appearance in Shang-Chi for Cretton. Holland previously expressed interest in an MCU team-up with Spider-Man and the Hulk, enjoying an image from the comics of the pair together and believing they should have a \"big brother-little brother\" dynamic. Additionally, Michael Mando was set to reprise his role as Mac Gargan / Scorpion from Homecoming, following up on the tease of more story for the character in that film's mid-credits scene.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 3, 2025, in Glasgow, Scotland, under the working title Blue Oasis, with Brett Pawlak returning as cinematographer from many of Cretton's previous films. The Jackie Chan Stunt Team coordinated the fight sequences, returning from Shang-Chi. Filming was previously expected to begin in early 2025, but was adjusted to work around Holland's other commitments, including filming for The Odyssey, which took place first. Production was scheduled for around two weeks throughout Glasgow city center, including Merchant City, George Square, and Trongate, for scenes set in New York City, and one of the film's action set pieces. Holland was excited to start principal photography with location shooting, returning to the feel of making Homecoming, after production on No Way Home was restricted to soundstages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was glad that fans could experience the start of filming with the cast and crew. Set photos from Glasgow showed armored vehicles with a red demon logo on them. Bradley Russell of Total Film compared these logos to the symbol for the Inner Demons gang, who are led by Mister Negative in the comics, and speculated that Mister Negative could be appearing in the film. Paul Trainer at Glasgow World reported that the Glasgow set was using a reference bust in the shape of a rhinoceros head, similar to the design for the comics character Rhino.\nSoundstage work for Brand New Day is taking place at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. Filming took place at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey, England, on August 7. Around then, filming in Glasgow was extended until August 18, for the shooting of a commercial. Tramell Tillman joined the cast at the end of August.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nCretton discussed the film at Sony's CinemaCon panel in March 2025 and Holland appeared via a video message to announce the title. Commentators noted the appropriateness of the title considering the \"Brand New Day\" comic book storyline explores a reset of Spider-Man's character and story following the events of the 2007–08 \"One More Day\" storyline, similar to the reset for the MCU's Peter Parker at the end of No Way Home. There was also speculation about what impact the events of Doomsday would have on the film. Diego Peralta at ComicBook.com questioned whether it would adapt specific elements from the comic storylines, such as having Parker make a deal with Mephisto to resurrect his aunt May Parker following her death in No Way Home, or if the title was just a reference to Parker's new life. Kevin Erdmann of Screen Rant said the \"One More Day\" and \"Brand New Day\" storylines were controversial with readers, in part because they reverted Spider-Man's character growth and relationships. He felt the film could follow a similar storyline without making the same mistake.\n\nOn August 1, 2025—known as \"Spider-Man Day\"—Sony released a nine-second teaser of the film's new Spider-Man costume. It has comics-accurate red and blue colors, raised webbing, and the same faint hexagonal webbing design on the fabric from Holland's previous suits. Michael McWhertor at Polygon likened the raised webbing to the suit worn by former Spider-Man actor Tobey Maguire and said the fabric was \"glittery and textured\", a contrast to Holland's prior high-tech suits. Gizmodo's James Whitbrook said the new costume retained some of the \"metallic shiny blue\" from the suit that was introduced at the end of No Way Home. The next day, a twenty-second teaser was released with a full look at Holland in costume. Justin Carter, also at Gizmodo, said the biggest change other than the raised webbing was the spider logo on the chest, which is bigger than the one on Holland's previous costumes. Carter also noted the use of Michael Giacchino's MCU Spider-Man theme in the teaser. Jordan Moreau at Variety said the full costume was closer to the comics than Holland's previous costumes, while McKinley Franklin of The Hollywood Reporter said it resembled the suits worn by Maguire and Andrew Garfield in previous films. Discussing the new costume for Screen Rant, Andy Behbakht compared it to the suit that was introduced at the end of No Way Home. He pointed out that the script for No Way Home explains that Holland's Parker took inspiration from Maguire and Garfield's suits when designing his own. On August 10, Sony released a behind-the-scenes video recapping the first day of filming. Jack Dunn, also of Variety, felt Sony and Marvel had been generous with the amount of looks at the film they had released so far.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day is scheduled to be released by Sony Pictures Releasing in the United States on July 31, 2026. It was previously scheduled for release on July 24 of that year, but was pushed back a week so it would be released two weeks after The Odyssey instead of one, avoiding contention for the majority of IMAX screens which were expected to go to The Odyssey for around two weeks. Disney had intended to release an unspecified Marvel Studios film on that initial July date, but removed this from their release schedule in August 2024, which allowed Sony to schedule the fourth Spider-Man film then. It will be part of Phase Six of the MCU.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nIn April 2021, Sony signed deals with Netflix and Disney for the rights to their 2022 to 2026 film slate, following the films' theatrical and home media windows. Netflix signed for exclusive \"pay 1 window\" streaming rights, which is typically an 18-month window and included future Spider-Man films following Spider-Man: No Way Home. Disney signed for \"pay 2 window\" rights for the films, which would be streamed on Disney+ and Hulu as well as broadcast on Disney's linear television networks.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day at IMDb \nOfficial website  at Marvel.com",

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 15% of 13 critics' reviews are positive. Lipika Verma of Deccan Chronicle gave it a 3.5/5 rating praising it as a perfect family film- A story with fresh comedy, action and emotions, with the ingredients matching, while also praising the cast, music, cinematography and direction.  E24 Bollywood, writing in Hindi, gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, stating that it \"leaves no stone unturned in making you laugh\", while praising the direction of Vijay Kumar Arora and the performances of Ajay Devgn, Mrunal Thakur and Ravi Kishan. Dhaval Roy from The Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of 5, noting the film delivered hilarity regularly, while finding the plot tangled and overstuffed with characters and comic tracks, the song-and-dance sequences further dragging on without advancing the plot, and the climax convoluted, predictable, and over‑dramatised. Rishabh Suri from Hindustan Times also gave the film 3 stars out of 5, praising the performances and calling it a light-hearted comedy with a simple screenplay and engaging characters. \nNishad Thaivalappil from CNN-News18 awarded a similar rating of 3 stars out of 5, praising the performances while feeling the film lacked good humour. Devesh Sharma from Filmfare gave it 3/5 stars saying it is fun and games - a loud, loony, live-action cartoon which gleefully chucks logic out of the window and asks you bring along your funny bone. Piya Roy of The Telegraph (India) wrote that Son of Sardaar 2 starts out in the first half as genuinely funny and keeps the viewer's interest high, but felt that some elements in the second half added unnecessary baggage to it, while also mentioning that the complex issue of Indo-Pakistan dynamics is handled in the film in a \"humorous and clever way\". Anuj Kumar from The Hindu wrote that this film is a stereotypical Punjabi entertainer, a goofy comedy with strong performances (in particular Deepak Dobriyal and Ravi Kishen) and jokes that land, but also said that there are passages which make you cringe.\nVineeta Kumar from India Today gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5, remarking that while the film mixed India-Pakistan banter and awkward romance, it lacked the original's charm, and Devgn and Mrunal Thakur's chemistry felt forced and unconvincing. Bollywood Hungama gave the film 2 stars out of 5, finding the story promising and praising the background score, cinematography and production design, while feeling the music was not up to the mark and the humour was limited. Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express also gave the film 2 stars out of 5, praising Dobriyal's portrayal of a trans character, while feeling the film wanted to be a laugh-a-minute, madcap caper, but kept slackening.\nSaibal Chatterjee from NDTV gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, labelling it a comedy in which neither the whole nor the sum of its parts added up to much, while finding Kishan sporadically funny and praising the cinematography. Lachmi Deb Roy of Firstpost similarly gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5 and praised the performances of Kishan and Dobriyal, while finding the storyline bogus and the film poorly executed. Shreyas Pande from Cinema Express gave the film 1 star out of 5, remarking that while it was promoted as a family entertainer, parents will uncomfortably squirm on their seats watching the film continuously make bottom line derogatory jokes. Rahul Desai from The Hollywood Reporter India found the film more progressive and less performative than a majority of mainstream Hindi cinema, while also feeling the film blurred the lines between unintentional and intentional humour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSon of Sardaar 2 at IMDb\nSon of Sardaar 2 at Bollywood Hungama",

        "title": "The Life of a Showgirl",
        "content": "The Life of a Showgirl is the upcoming twelfth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It is scheduled for release on October 3, 2025, by Republic Records. Swift conceived the album during the European leg of the Eras Tour in 2024. She wrote and produced it with Max Martin and Shellback in Sweden, marking her first collaboration with the duo since her album Reputation (2017).\nSwift described the project as a vibrant and lively album about her life as an entertainer. The Life of a Showgirl contains 12 songs, with Sabrina Carpenter featured on the title track. The cover was photographed by Mert and Marcus; Swift adopted a provocative, showgirl-inspired, orange theme for the album, with journalists describing it as the most glamorous and flamboyant visual aesthetic of her career. She announced the album on the August 13, 2025, episode of New Heights, the sports podcast by Jason and Travis Kelce, which became the most-watched podcast premiere ever.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTaylor Swift released her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, on April 19, 2024. Conceived amidst Swift's heightened fame and publicized personal life during her 2023 run of the Eras Tour, The Tortured Poets Department became the global best-selling album of 2024. She included songs from the album in a revamped set list for the European and final North American legs of the Eras Tour, running from May to December 2024.\nIn April 2025, Universal Music Sweden reported in a now-deleted post that Swedish violinist Erik Arvinder was involved in the production of Swift's upcoming music. On July 15, Hits magazine reported \"seismic rumblings of a new Taylor [Swift album]\" before removing the claim hours later. Swift teased The Life of a Showgirl with various Easter eggs, with publications noting the specific outfit choices, social media posts, numbers, visuals, and performances spanning the promotional cycles of Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department, as well as the Eras Tour.\n\n\n== Writing and production ==\nSwift produced The Life of a Showgirl alongside Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, both of whom previously worked with Swift on her albums Red (2012), 1989 (2014), and Reputation (2017). She stated the collaboration began after she spoke to Martin in May 2024 while the Eras Tour was playing in Stockholm. She then traveled to Sweden in between tour dates on the European leg in the following months to record the album. Swift said the album is about what she went through and felt behind the scenes during the tour. This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant. It just comes from, like, the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life [...] and so that effervescence has come through on this record. And like [Travis Kelce] said, bangers.\nSwift asserted that there are no bonus songs for the album, as she wanted to have only twelve songs for her twelfth album. Swift explained that she wanted to create \"an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle\". She also stated that creating \"infectious\" melodies was one of her goals with the album, in contrast to its lyrically heavy predecessor. It is her first album since Red to not involve the American record producer Jack Antonoff.\n\n\n=== Songs ===\n\nThe opening track, \"The Fate of Ophelia\", is considered a reference to the death of Ophelia, the lead female character of English playwright William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. The second track, \"Elizabeth Taylor\", is titled after the English-American actress. Swift has previously referenced Taylor in the lyrics of her 2017 song, \"...Ready for It?\" from Reputation. The final song and the title track, \"The Life of a Showgirl\", features the American singer Sabrina Carpenter, who was one of the opening acts of the Eras Tour and has cited Swift as an artistic influence.\n\n\n== Promotion and impact ==\nOn August 11, 2025, the weekly sports podcast New Heights—hosted by Swift's boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce and his brother Jason—posted a thumbnail promoting their next episode, featuring a silhouette of Swift. Swift's marketing team, Taylor Nation, shared 12 pictures of Swift in orange-colored outfits from the Eras Tour, with the caption \"Thinking about when she said, 'See you next era'\", referencing the last sentence in The Eras Tour Book. A countdown with an orange background appeared on Swift's website, ending at 12:12 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−04:00) on August 12. Shortly after, New Heights released a snippet from the episode, revealing Swift as their special guest. When the countdown ended, Swift's website briefly crashed before revealing the title of her twelfth studio album to be The Life of a Showgirl, and featured a pre-order interface for the physical album (vinyl LP, cassette tape, and CD). A second New Heights teaser showed Swift confirming the album's title while displaying a blurred version of the cover artwork.\nA Spotify playlist curated by Swift, titled \"And, baby, that's show business for you\", was promoted through billboards in New York City and Nashville, Tennessee. The playlist contained all 22 songs from her discography that were produced by Martin and Shellback. Google Searches for \"Taylor Swift\" displayed orange confetti, a flaming heart emoji, and the previously revealed Spotify playlist title. Following the album announcement, buildings such as the Empire State Building and Kansas City Union Station were illuminated in orange, and media publications like Women's Wear Daily and National Geographic published stories about the history and influence of showgirls. The Life of a Showgirl also inspired various brands, companies, corporations, and franchises to post glittery-orange memes and parodies on their social media accounts.\nJournalists wrote that Swift \"broke the internet\" with the New Heights episode and album announcement on August 13. During the podcast, Swift revealed the album's cover artwork, track listing, collaborators, theme, and the release date of October 3. Four limited edition CD variants titled \"Sweat and Vanilla Perfume,\" \"It's Frightening,\" \"It's Rapturous,\" and \"It's Beautiful\", each with its own cover and color scheme, were made available for pre-order. On August 18, 21 and 25, Swift also made \"The Shiny Bug\", \"Baby, That's Show Business\" and \"Tiny Bubbles in Champagne\" limited-edition vinyl variants available for pre-order, respectively.\nCommentators believed that Swift blended her personal life with her career through the podcast appearance, benefiting from high engagement in both her and Kelce's respective fields. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the episode is \"one of the most revealing and unguarded interviews\" of Swift's entire career, foregoing traditional promotional strategies such as magazines and mainstream television. The release date was decoded as 10/3, which adds up to 13, Swift's favorite number, while some publications highlighted that it is unofficially observed as National Boyfriend Day. Swift also specified that the date coincided with Kelce's birthday weekend.\nWith over 1.3 million live viewers, the episode set a Guinness World Record for the most concurrent views for a podcast on YouTube, surpassing the previous record held by US President Donald Trump's appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. It became the most-watched episode of New Heights, accumulating over 10 million views in less than 20 hours. Some publications also believed this announcement was Swift's response to Trump's open criticism about her, after she had endorsed the opposition Democratic candidates for the 2024 United States presidential election. According to Spotify, New Heights saw a 3,000 percent increase in new listeners, while its female audience grew by 618 percent. Within one day of its release, the episode became one of the platform's most watched podcasts in the previous 12 months.\nOn August 31, the album became the most pre-saved album of all time on Spotify, breaking Swift's own record which she previously achieved with The Tortured Poets Department.\n\n\n== Artwork and aesthetic ==\n\nEach of Swift's albums has a color associated with it. The Life of a Showgirl and its album cycle are orange-themed; Swift described the shade as \"Portofino Orange Glitter\". Women's Wear Daily stated that the hue resembles \"Pantone 17-1349\" the most. The color went viral on the Internet; Pinterest reported a 8,276 percentage surge in searches of \"bold orange glitter\" following the album's announcement.\nPhotographs for the album's showgirl-inspired promotional material were shot by the fashion photography duo Mert and Marcus, who had previously worked with Swift on Reputation. The standard cover artwork depicts Swift half-submerged in water while wearing a bralette adorned with lines of diamonds covering her torso, customized by AREA. Parts of the cover fragment Swift's body into pieces resembling shattered glass, and the title The Life of a Showgirl is written in orange glitter. Swift stated that the cover was intended to glamorize the offstage aspects of the Eras Tour, stating that each show \"ends with [her] in a bathtub.\" Several journalists interpreted the cover as a reference to John Everett Millais's Hamlet-inspired painting Ophelia. Prestige Hong Kong's Surabhi Redkar wrote that \"while Ophelia's eyes are left lifeless following her drowning, Swift gazes directly at you from the cover, suggesting that she isn't one to suffer and drown under the norms of patriarchy that once killed Ophelia.\" Harper's Bazaar's Joel Calfee likened the cover to a scene in the music video for Swift's song \"Look What You Made Me Do\" (2017), where she sits in a bathtub full of jewels. Aishwary Kosla of The Indian Express distinguished that Swift \"wears sequins, diamonds and a defiant gaze\" in the cover instead of the painting's \"tragic maiden drifting toward death\".\nSwift also wore customized outfits from the fashion brand The Blonds for the album photoshoot, accessorized with sandals designed by Rene Caovilla and jewellery by Lorraine Schwartz. A rhinestone-encrusted bra and thong set worn by Swift for the photoshoot, complete with a headpiece, feathered armbands, and hip accessories, was originally designed by Bob Mackie for the finale of Donn Arden's longest-running revue at the Las Vegas Strip, Jubilee! (1981–2016). The cover of the Baby, That's Show Business edition features Swift in the Jubilee! costume with a yellow headpiece and a choker necklace adorned with three rhinestone pendants, alongside her Eras Tour backup dancers dressed as showgirls.\nPublications characterized the album's overall aesthetic as depicting the flamboyance, extravagance, and maximalism of showgirls. Calfee deemed it the \"most provocative aesthetic\" of Swift's career, while The Times's Olivia Petter considered The Life of a Showgirl her first album cycle that intentionally sexualized her public image. Marie Claire's Halie LeSavage described the aesthetic as \"sensual and sparkling, and the most revealing Swift has ever dressed in the public eye.\" Jay Stahl and Nicole Fallert from USA Today wrote that it demonstrated Swift \"reclaiming ownership over her body from the public\", stating that she \"has always known when – and what – to show\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAdapted from Swift's web store.

        "title": "India",
        "content": "India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia.  It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country since 2023; and, since its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Myanmar, Thailand, and Indonesia.\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its hymns recorded the early dawnings of Hinduism in India. India's pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions. By 400 BCE, caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires. Widespread creativity suffused this era, but the status of women declined, and untouchability became an organised belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts. Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains in the second millennium. The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture. In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. The Mughal Empire ushered in two centuries of economic expansion and relative peace, leaving a rich architectural legacy. Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company turned India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root. A nationalist movement emerged in India, the first in the non-European British empire and an influence on other nationalist movements. Noted for nonviolent resistance after 1920, it became the primary factor in ending British rule. In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied the partition.\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.4 billion in 2023. During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951, India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class. Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture. India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition, and rising levels of air pollution. India's land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots. India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture, is supported in protected habitats.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India (Ἰνδία), Ancient Greek Indos (Ἰνδός), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or 'river'—specifically the Indus River, and by extension its well-settled southern basin. The Ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi, 'the people of the Indus'.\nThe term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India, is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India, Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.\nHindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century, and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing the northern Indian subcontinent (present-day northern India and Pakistan) or to India in its near entirety.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient India ===\n55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa. The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan. These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia, which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India. Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.\nDuring the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones. The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism, were composed during this period, and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period. On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period, as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.\n\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas. The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. \nIn an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Maurya Empire. The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia. In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women. By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms. Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself. This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite. Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.\n\n\n=== Medieval India ===\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region. During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language. They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent. Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. \nBy repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire. Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.\n\n\n=== Early modern India ===\n\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. \nThe Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.\n\n\n=== Modern India ===\n\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe. Disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. \nAlthough the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets. There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines, and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. The railway network provided critical famine relief, notably reduced the cost of moving goods, and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served, a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol. During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.\nVital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic. Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and with the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical knowledge, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies, and increased its geopolitical influence. Yet, India is also shaped by persistent poverty, both rural and urban; by religious and caste-related violence; by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies; and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China and with Pakistan. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved. As of 2025, poverty in India declined sharply, mainly due to government welfare programs.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate. India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate. These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas. Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east. To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats; the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.\nIndia's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores. Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. \nImportant tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi. The Kosi's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. \nFour major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane. Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018. Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them. India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic. India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots, or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.\nIndia's most dense forests, such as the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India, occupy approximately 3% of its land area. Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area. It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India. India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible. Among the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine, and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul, which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro, and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago. India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographic passes flanking the Himalayas. This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians. Among endemics are the vulnerable hooded leaf monkey and the threatened Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats.\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms. These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle. Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct. The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988. India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves, four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; its eighty-nine wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nIndia is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system. It has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and over 50 regional parties. Congress is considered the ideological centre in Indian political culture, whereas the BJP is right-wing to far-right. From 1950 to the late 1980s, Congress held a majority in India's parliament. Afterwards, it increasingly shared power with the BJP, as well as with powerful regional parties, which forced multi-party coalition governments at the centre.\nIn the general elections in 1951, 1957, and 1962, Congress, led by Jawaharlal Nehru, won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, who led the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency Indira Gandhi had declared in 1975, Congress was voted out of power in 1977; Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted two years; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh served as prime ministers. After Congress was returned to power in 1980, Indira Gandhi was assassinated and succeeded by Rajiv Gandhi, who won comfortably in the elections later that year. A National Front coalition led by the Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front won the 1989 elections, with the subsequent government lasting just under two years, and V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar serving as prime ministers. In the 1991 Indian general election, Congress, as the largest single party, formed a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.\nAfter the 1996 Indian general election, the BJP formed a government briefly; it was followed by United Front coalitions, which depended on external political support. Two prime ministers served during this period: H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP formed a coalition—the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term. In the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority. Still, the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties. Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term. In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win an absolute majority. In the 2019 general election, the BJP regained an absolute majority. In the 2024 general election, a BJP-led NDA coalition formed the government. Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat, is in his third term as the prime minister of India and has served in the position since 26 May 2014.\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India. Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. India's form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states, has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.\nThe Government of India comprises three branches: the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary. The President of India is the ceremonial head of state, who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures. The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power. Appointed by the president, the prime minister is supported by the party or political alliance with a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament. The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People). The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years. Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population. The Lok Sabha's 543 members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18; they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms. Several seats from each state are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population within that state.\nIndia has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts. The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts. It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories. All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.\n\n\n==== States ====\n\n\n==== Union territories ====\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nIndia became a republic in 1950, remaining a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia in the 1950s; it played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement. After initially cordial relations, India suffered a humiliating military defeat to China in a 1962 war. Another military conflict followed in 1967 in which India successfully repelled a Chinese attack. \nIndia has had uneasy relations with its western neighbour, Pakistan. The two countries went to war in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir. In contrast, the 1971 war followed India's support for the independence of Bangladesh. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union. By the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier. India has played a key role in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has supplied 100,000 military and police personnel in 35 UN peacekeeping operations.\nChina's nuclear test of 1964 and threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war caused India to produce nuclear weapons. India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine. \nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military cooperation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce; India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces. With 1.45 million active troops, they are the world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard. The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP. Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% on the previous fiscal year. India is the world's second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports. Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3.94 trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, at around $15.0 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. However, due to its low GDP per capita—which ranks 136th in the world in nominal per capita income and 125th in per capita income adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)—the vast majority of Indians fall into the low-income group. \nUntil 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows. India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second largest, as of 2017. The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022, highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries. In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985. In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.7%; In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter. Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%. India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years before 2007, India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century. Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030. In 2023, India's consumer market was the world's fifth largest. India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$2,731 in 2024. It is expected to grow to US$3,264 by 2026. \n\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nThe Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010, and exports by 36% during 2008–2009. In 2022, India became the world's third-largest vehicle market after China and the United States, surpassing Japan. At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8 million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in India includes 3,000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units; India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50–60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44 billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical market is estimated up to US$42 billion. India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world. The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4 billion (Indian rupees) to ₹235.24 billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nIndia's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable. The country's usage of coal is a major cause of India's greenhouse gas emissions, but its renewable energy is competing strongly. India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average. Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.\n\n\n=== Socio-economic challenges ===\n\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day. The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005. Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21%-22.5 in 2011. In 2019, the estimates had gone down to 10.2%. In 2014, 30.7% of India's children under the age of five were underweight. According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population was undernourished. The Midday Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8 million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging. According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1 million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001.\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018, an improvement from 85th in 2014.\nAs of 2025, poverty in India declined sharply. According to the World Bank report, extreme poverty fall from 16.2% in 2011-12 to 2.3% in 2022-23. In rural areas it fell from 18.4% to 2.8%, and in urban areas, from 10.7% to 1.1%. 378 million peopole were lifted from poverty and 171 million from extreme poverty. The main reason, according to the World Bank, is not economic growth but different government welfare programs, like transferring food and money to the people with low income, improving their access to services.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith an estimated 1,428,627,663 residents in 2023, India is the world's most populous country. 1,210,193,422 residents were reported in the 2011 provisional census report. Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011, compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001). The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males. The median age was 28.7 in 2020. \nThe first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people. Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India's population to grow rapidly. The life expectancy in India is 70 years to 71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men. There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.\n\n\n=== Urbanisation ===\n\nMigration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. In 2001, over 70% lived in rural areas. The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991. In the 2011 census, there were 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India. Among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nAmong speakers of the Indian languages, 74% speak Indo-Aryan languages, the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages; 24% speak Dravidian languages, indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan languages and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan languages. India has no national language. Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government. English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\"; it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others (0.9%). India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nThe literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males. The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas. Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%. In the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951, the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921, the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891, they were 5%, 9% and 1%, According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.\nThe education system of India is the world's second-largest. India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges and 1.5 million schools. In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Society ===\n\nThe Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\". India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. However, the system continues to be dominant in India, and caste-based inequality, discrimination, segregation, and violence persist. \nMulti-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Indians have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce. Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50 years ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period. According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care. Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society. The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines. Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.\n\n\n=== Visual art ===\n\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art. Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley civilisation of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but also some with human figures. The Pashupati seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known. After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving. Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement. \nIn the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art. Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force). This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati, or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities. Gupta art, at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves. Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues. But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.\nAncient paintings have only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are some of the most important. Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India from 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. These significantly influenced later artistic styles. The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars. The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh. As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence. In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.\n\n\n=== Clothing ===\n\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped. For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long. The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder. In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing over the shoulder—covering the midriff and obscuring the upper body's contours. For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c. 1300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c. 1525 CE). Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez. In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.\nSalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist. The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic, its side seams left open below the waistline. The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees.\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions. The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans. In office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round. For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars. The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,\nis seldom seen in the cities.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked plainly and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes. The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread; the idli, a steamed breakfast cake; or dosa, a griddled pancake. The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others. They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients may be mixed during the cooking process.\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables.\n\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents. About 20% to 39% of India's population consists of vegetarians. Much of this stems from caste hierarchy, as upper castes, such as the Brahmins, consider vegetarian food to be \"pure\". Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low. Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf, developed in the Abbasid caliphate, and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest. To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India. Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become biryani, a feature of festive dining in many parts of India. \nIn the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide, the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nSeveral traditional sports—such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani, gilli-danda, hopscotch and martial arts such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi—remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga; in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters, and world champions. Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.\nCricket is the most popular sport in India. India has won two Cricket World Cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition. India has won eight field hockey gold medals in the summer Olympics.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAdministrative divisions of India\nOutline of India\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\n=== Geography ===\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\n\n=== Foreign relations and military ===\n\n\n=== Economy ===\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\n\n=== Culture ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernment\n\nOfficial website of the Government of India\nGovernment of India Web Directory\nGeneral information\n\nIndia.

Please note that some of these symbols are used in ways specific to Wikipedia, and may differ from their usage in dictionaries.\nIf IPA symbols do not display correctly in your browser, see the troubleshooting links below.\nEditors should use IPA templates such as {{IPAc-en}} when adding IPA to Wikipedia articles, see Manual of Style/Pronunciation § Entering IPA characters for guidance. These templates ensure accessibility and tooltip functionality, see the documentation page for usage instructions.\n\nIf you are looking for an IPA symbol that does not appear in the pronunciation key below, see Help:IPA, which provides a more comprehensive list. For a table showing how the sounds on this page correspond to English spellings, see English orthography § Sound-to-spelling correspondences. For assistance in converting spellings to pronunciations, refer to English orthography § Spelling-to-sound correspondences.\nIn some cases, words given as examples for different symbols may sound the same to you. For instance, you might pronounce cot and caught, do and dew, or marry and merry the same. This typically results from dialect variation (see our articles English phonology and International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects). If so, you will likely pronounce those symbols the same in other words as well. Whether this applies to all words or only in certain contexts depends on the specific sound merger. The footnotes provide further explanation of these cases.\n\nNotes\n\nWords in SMALL CAPITALS are the standard lexical sets. Not all of the sets are used here. In particular, we excluded words in the lexical sets BATH and CLOTH, which may be given two transcriptions, the former either with /ɑː/ or /æ/, the latter with /ɒ/ or /ɔː/.\nThe length mark ⟨ː⟩ does not mean that the vowels transcribed with it are always longer than those without it. When unstressed, followed by a voiceless consonant, or in a polysyllabic word, a vowel in the former group is frequently shorter than the latter in other environments (see Clipping (phonetics) § English). /i, u/ likewise do not mean shorter versions of /iː, uː/ but represent a situation in which some speakers have /iː, uː/ and others /ɪ, ʊ/ (see Happy tensing).\n\nThis key represents diaphonemes, abstractions of speech sounds that accommodate General American, British Received Pronunciation (RP) and to a large extent also Australian, Canadian, Irish (including Ulster), New Zealand, Scottish, South African and Welsh English pronunciations. Therefore, not all of the distinctions shown here are relevant to a particular dialect.\n\n⟨i⟩ does not represent a phoneme but a variation between /iː/ and /ɪ/ in unstressed positions. Speakers of dialects with happy tensing (Australian English, General American, modern RP) should read it as an unstressed /iː/, whereas speakers of other dialects (e.g. some Northern England English) should treat it the same as /ɪ/. In Scotland, this vowel can be considered the same as the short allophone of /eɪ/, as in take. Before /ə/ within the same word, another possible pronunciation is /j/ as in yet.\nMany speakers of American, Canadian, Scottish and Irish English pronounce cot /ˈkɒt/ and caught /ˈkɔːt/ the same. You may simply ignore the difference between the symbols /ɒ/ and /ɔː/,  just as you ignore the distinction between the written vowels o and au when pronouncing them.\nMost speakers of North American English (with the exception of Eastern New England) do not distinguish between the vowels in father /'fɑːðər/ and bother /'bɒðər/, pronouncing the two words as rhymes. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between the symbols /ɑː/ and /ɒ/.\nSpeakers of some rhotic dialects, for instance in Ireland and Scotland, may not distinguish between the vowels of near /ˈnɪər/, cure /ˈkjʊər/ and square /ˈskwɛər/ on the one hand and freerunning /ˈfriːrʌnɪŋ/, Q-rating /ˈkjuːreɪtɪŋ/ and dayroom /ˈdeɪruːm/ on the other. If you speak such a dialect, read /ɪər, ʊər, ɛər/ as /iːr, uːr, eɪr/.\nIn Northern Ireland, Scotland and many North American dialects the distinction between /ʊr/ as in courier and the aforementioned /ʊər/ and /uːr/ does not exist. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between /ʊr/, /ʊər/ and /uːr/.\nIn Northern Ireland and Scotland this merger occurs in all environments, which means that foot /ˈfʊt/ and goose /ˈɡuːs/ also have the same vowel. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between /ʊ/ and /uː/ in all contexts.\nIn North America, the /ʊr/ of courier and the /ʊər/ of cure may instead merge with /ɔːr/ as in north or /ɜːr/ as in nurse. No such merger is possible in the case of the sequence which we transcribe as /uːr/ as there is an implied morpheme boundary after the length mark.\nIn North American dialects that do not distinguish between /ʊr/, /ʊər/ and /uːr/ there is also no distinction between the /ɪr/ of mirror and the aforementioned /ɪər/ and /iːr/. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between /ɪr/, /ɪər/ and /iːr/.\nIn many North American dialects there is also no distinction between the vowels in merry /ˈmɛri/, Mary /ˈmɛəri/ and marry /ˈmæri/. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between /ɛr/, /ɛər/ and /ær/. Some speakers keep marry and/or merry separate from the rest, but in the General American accent all three vowels are the same and may not be distinct from /eɪr/ as in dayroom /ˈdeɪruːm/.\nIn rhotic North American English there is no distinction between the vowels in nurse /ˈnɜːrs/ and letter /ˈlɛtər/. If you speak such a dialect, read /ɜːr/ as /ər/. The /ʌr/ of hurry often joins this neutralization; if you have it in your speech, read /ɜːr/, /ər/ and /ʌr/ as /ər/.\nSome speakers from Northern England do not distinguish the vowel of square /ˈskwɛər/ and nurse /ˈnɜːrs/. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between the symbols /ɛər/ and /ɜːr/.\nIn New Zealand English, the vowels of kit /ˈkɪt/ and focus /ˈfoʊkəs/ have the same schwa-like quality. If you are from New Zealand, ignore the difference between the symbols /ɪ/ and /ə/.\nIn contemporary New Zealand English and some other dialects, the vowels of near /ˈnɪər/ and square /ˈskwɛər/ are not distinguished. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between the symbols /ɪər/ and /ɛər/.\nIn Northern England English and some varieties of Irish and Welsh English, the vowels of foot /ˈfʊt/ and strut /ˈstrʌt/ are not distinguished. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between the symbols /ʊ/ and /ʌ/.\nIn some varieties of Scottish English and in Northern Irish English, the vowels of trap /ˈtræp/ and palm /ˈpɑːm/ are not distinguished. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between the symbols /æ/ and /ɑː/.\nIn Welsh English and some other dialects, the vowels of unorthodoxy /ʌnˈɔːrθədɒksi/ and an orthodoxy /ən ˈɔːrθədɒksi/ are not distinguished. If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between the symbols /ʌ/ and /ə/.\nDepending on the dialect, vowels can be subject to various mergers before /l/, so that e.g. fill /ˈfɪl/ and feel /ˈfiːl/ or pull /ˈpʊl/ and pool /ˈpuːl/ may not be distinguished. L-vocalization may trigger even more mergers, so that e.g. cord /ˈkɔːrd/ and called /ˈkɔːld/ may be homophonous as /ˈkɔːd/ in non-rhotic dialects of South East England. See English-language vowel changes before historic /l/ for more information.\nIn many dialects, /r/ occurs only before a vowel; if you speak such a dialect, simply ignore /r/ in the pronunciation guides where you would not pronounce it, as in cart /kɑːrt/.\nIn other dialects, /j/ (yes) cannot occur after /t, d, n/, etc., within the same syllable; if you speak such a dialect, then ignore the /j/ in transcriptions such as new /njuː/. For example, New York is transcribed /njuː ˈjɔːrk/. For most people from England and for some New Yorkers, the /r/ in /jɔːrk/ is not pronounced; for most people from the United States, including some New Yorkers, the /j/ in /njuː/ is not pronounced and may be ignored. (See yod-dropping.)\nOn the other hand, there are some distinctions which you might make but which this key does not encode, as they are seldom reflected in the dictionaries used as sources for Wikipedia articles:\n\nThe vowels of kit and bit, distinguished in South Africa. Both of them are transcribed as /ɪ/ in stressed syllables and as /ɪ/ or /ə/ in unstressed syllables.\nThe difference between the vowels of fir, fur and fern, maintained in some Scottish and Irish English but lost elsewhere. All of them are transcribed as /ɜːr/.\nThe vowels of north and force, distinguished in Scottish English, Irish English and by a minority of American speakers. Both of them are transcribed as /ɔːr/.\nThe vowels of pause and paws, distinguished in Cockney and by some Estuary English speakers. Both of them are transcribed as /ɔː/ when the spelling does not contain ⟨r⟩ and /ɔːr/ or /ʊər/ (depending on the word) when it does.\nThe vowels of manning and Manning, distinguished in some parts of the United States (see /æ/ raising). Both of them are transcribed as /æ/.\nThe difference between the vowels of pain and pane found in some English, Welsh, and Newfoundland dialects. Both of them are transcribed as /eɪ/.\nThe difference between the vowels of toe and tow found in some English, Welsh, and Newfoundland dialects. Both of them are transcribed as /oʊ/.\nThe difference between the vowels of holy and wholly found in Cockney and many Estuary English speakers. Both of them are transcribed as /oʊ/.\nAny allophonic distinctions, such as:\nThe vowels of bad and lad, distinguished in many parts of Australia and Southern England. Both of them are transcribed as /æ/.\nThe vowels of spider and spied her, distinguished in many parts of Scotland, plus many parts of North America. Both of them are transcribed as /aɪ/.\nThe vowels of rider and writer, distinguished in most parts of Canada and many parts of the United States. Both of them are transcribed as /aɪ/.\nThe vowels of powder and pouter distinguished in most parts of Canada and some parts of the United States. Both of them are transcribed as /aʊ/.\nAllophonic vowel length (including the Scottish vowel length rule), as in knife /ˈnaɪf/ vs. knives /ˈnaɪvz/. Phonemic vowel length, which exists in some dialects and involves pairs such as /ɛ/ vs. /ɛər/ and /ə/ vs. /ɜːr/ is also not marked explicitly. /i/ and /u/ do not represent phonemes; see above.\nFlapping in words such as better, which we write /ˈbɛtər/, rather than /ˈbɛdər/.\nGlottalization in words such as jetlag and, in some accents, daughter, which we write /ˈdʒɛtlæɡ/ and /ˈdɔːtər/, rather than /ˈdʒɛʔlæɡ/ and /ˈdɔːʔər/. In this system, /ʔ/ is used only for paralanguage or in loanwords where it occurs phonemically in the original language.\nL-vocalization in words such as bottle and Alps, which we write /ˈbɒtəl/ and /ˈælps/, rather than /ˈbɒtʊ/ and /ˈæwps/.\nThe difference between allophones of /ə/ in balance ([ə]) vs. the ones in about and Russia (and, in non-rhotic dialects, better), both of which may be closer to /ʌ/ in dialects with the foot–strut split (that is, [ɐ]) vs. the one in button (the syllabicity of the following consonant). All are transcribed as /ə/ in our system.\nThe difference between the phonetic realization of English sounds (mostly vowels) in various dialects. Let's pick some grapes for Betty should be transcribed /lɛts ˈpɪk səm ˈɡreɪps fər ˈbɛti/ regardless of the variety of English and everyone should interpret that transcription according to their own dialect. Thus, a person from South East England will read it as something like [lɛʔs ˈpʰɪk səm ˈɡɹɛɪps fə ˈbɛtˢɪi], a Scot as [ɫɛts ˈpʰɪk səm ˈɡɾeps fɚ ˈbɛte], whereas someone from New Zealand will interpret that transcription as [ɫɪts ˈpʰək səm ˈɡɹæɪps fə ˈbɪɾi]. Because we are transcribing diaphonemes rather than phones (actual sounds), it is irrelevant that, for example, the vowel in let's as pronounced by someone from New Zealand overlaps with how people with England and Scotland typically pronounce the first vowel in pick, or that the Scottish realization of /r/ after /ɡ/ overlaps with the New Zealand realization of /t/ between vowels. In other words, the symbol ⟨ɛ⟩ does not stand specifically for the open-mid front unrounded vowel in our system but any vowel that can be identified as the vowel in let's, depending on the accent. This is also why we use the simple symbol ⟨r⟩ for the second sound in grapes.\nOther words may have different vowels depending on the speaker.\nFor more extensive information on dialect variations, you may wish to see the IPA chart for English dialects.\nNote that place names are not generally exempted from being transcribed in this abstracted system, so rules such as the above must be applied in order to recover the local pronunciation. Examples include place names in much of England ending -‍ford, which although locally pronounced [-fəd] are transcribed /-fərd/. This is best practice for editors. However, readers should be aware that not all editors may have followed this consistently, so for example if /-fəd/ is encountered for such a place name, it should not be interpreted as a claim that the /r/ would be absent even in a rhotic dialect.\n\nIf you feel it is necessary to add a pronunciation respelling using another convention, then please use the conventions of Wikipedia's pronunciation respelling key.\n\nTo compare the following IPA symbols with non-IPA American dictionary conventions that may be more familiar, see Pronunciation respelling for English, which lists the pronunciation guides of fourteen English dictionaries published in the United States.\nTo compare the following IPA symbols with other IPA conventions that may be more familiar, see Help:IPA/Conventions for English, which lists the conventions of eight English dictionaries published in Britain, Australia, and the United States.\n\nIf your browser does not display IPA symbols, you probably need to install a font that includes the IPA (for good, free IPA fonts, see the download links in the articles for Gentium, and the more complete Charis SIL; for a monospaced font, see the complete Everson Mono).\nFor a guide to adding IPA characters to Wikipedia articles, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Pronunciation § Entering IPA characters.\nHelp:IPA/Conventions for English\nHelp:Pronunciation respelling key\nPronunciation respelling for English\nCategory:Pages with English IPA (228)\n\nGetting JAWS 6.1 to recognize \"exotic\" Unicode symbols – for help on getting the screen reader JAWS to read IPA symbols\nIPA Reader – web-based IPA synthesizer using Amazon Polly\nPhoneme Synthesis – web-based IPA synthesizer using eSpeak",

        "title": "The Naked Gun",
        "content": "The Naked Gun, based on the TV show known as Police Squad!, is a media franchise consisting of American crime spoof-slapstick comedy films, created by the comedy filmmaking trio Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. It includes one television series, four theatrical films and a video game. The series centers on a bumbling police detective who solves criminal cases in comical fashion. Leslie Nielsen stars in the television series and the first three films as the protagonist Detective Sergeant Frank Drebin; a fourth film starring Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin Jr. was released in 2025. Critics have praised the TV series and the films, all four of which have been financially successful.\n\n\n== Television ==\n\n\n=== Police Squad! (1982) ===\n\nPolice Squad is an American crime parody television series that was broadcast on ABC in 1982. The series starred Leslie Nielsen as Franklin \"Frank\" Drebin, and was co-created and written by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker. Parodying police procedurals, the series featured the use of sight gags, wordplay and non sequiturs. Although the show was canceled after six episodes, it was later followed by the successful Naked Gun film series, and in 2013 TV Guide ranked it #7 on its list of 60 shows that were \"Cancelled Too Soon\".\n\n\n== Film ==\n\n\n=== The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988) ===\n\nDetective Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) tries to uncover a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II, who is on an official visit to the United States. The main suspect is Vincent Ludwig, a rich businessman (Ricardo Montalbán), who uses a hypnotic device to turn others into murderers. On the case, Drebin falls in love with Ludwig's assistant, Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley). She knows nothing about Ludwig's plot, and after the pair spends the night together, Jane helps with Frank's investigation. As with previous ZAZ spoof comedies, the plot was mostly culled from a more serious film, in this case Telefon.\n\n\n=== The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear (1991) ===\n\nFrank discovers that Jane's new boyfriend, Quentin Hapsburg (Robert Goulet), is involved in an evil plan to kidnap Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer (Richard Griffiths), a scientist whom President George H. W. Bush (John Roarke) has chosen to determine a new national energy policy. Hapsburg plans to kidnap the real Dr. Meinheimer and replace him with a lookalike named Earl Hacker (also portrayed by Griffiths) who will endorse an energy policy according to the dictates of the energy lobby.\n\n\n=== Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult (1994) ===\n\nIn the third film of the series, Frank is married to Jane, and he has retired from Police Squad. The film introduces the criminal Rocco Dillon (Fred Ward), who is stuck in prison. He is contacted by someone called Papshmir to be given a target for a bombing. Frank is pulled out of retirement. He goes undercover pretending to be a prisoner named \"Nick 'the Slasher' McGurk Jr., III\" at the jail where Dillon is being held, and they break out of jail. Outside they are escorted by Dillon's gangster mother (Kathleen Freeman) to his country retreat, where Frank also meets Rocco's voluptuous moll (Anna Nicole Smith). The gang plots to blow up the Academy Awards. When Jane arrives looking for Frank, she is taken hostage.\n\n\n=== The Naked Gun (2025) ===\n\nAfter years of aborted attempts at a new film, a sequel was greenlit in 2022. Directed by Akiva Schaffer and written by Schaffer, Dan Gregor, and Doug Mand, the film stars Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin Jr. Principal photography was originally tentatively scheduled for summer 2023. Principal photography ran from May to June 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. The film was released on August 1, 2025.\n\n\n=== Future ===\nIn August 2025, producer Erica Huggins said in an interview that discussions about a sequel to the new film were ongoing between the actors, writers and producers.\n\n\n== Video games ==\n\n\n=== The Naked Gun: ICUP (2012) ===\nThe Naked Gun: ICUP, a point-and-click adventure game, was released by Gamecentric Media and Paramount for iOS, Android, and Windows in 2012. The story and concept were penned by Robert LoCash, a writer of the Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult. Due to Leslie Nielsen's death in 2010, voice actor A.J. LoCascio took over as Frank Drebin Jr., the son of the original character. The game received an average score of 60 on the review aggregator Metacritic.\n\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n\n== Additional crew and production details ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office performance ===\n\n\n=== Critical and public response ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! at IMDb\nThe Naked Gun 2+1⁄2: The Smell of Fear at IMDb\nNaked Gun 33+1⁄3: The Final Insult at IMDb",

        "title": "Jeff Baena",
        "content": "Jeffrey Lance Baena (  BAY-nə; June 29, 1977 – January 3, 2025) was an American screenwriter and film director. His most successful films were 2004's I Heart Huckabees and 2020's Horse Girl, though his projects to receive the most contemporaneous critical acclaim were the 2016 and 2017 films Joshy and The Little Hours. Baena frequently worked with his wife Aubrey Plaza, and writing partner Alison Brie.\nHe began his career as a screenwriter, co-writing the 2004 comedy film I Heart Huckabees and, around the same time, seeing his script for Life After Beth enter production before being shelved. Baena, as an independent filmmaker, expanded to directing a decade later and filmed Life After Beth as his directorial debut, starring Aubrey Plaza and released in 2014. Working with producer Liz Destro, Plaza, and an expanding group of frequent collaborators, Baena was then writer-director for Joshy (2016) and The Little Hours (2017), which both became critically acclaimed and found a cult audience.\nAmong the performers in these films was Alison Brie, with whom Baena struck up a writing partnership and created works produced by Duplass Brothers Productions. They made the 2020 psychological drama film Horse Girl together, Baena's most commercial film, followed by the television anthology series Cinema Toast (2021) and Baena's final film, 2022's Spin Me Round. His first films implement his post-mumblecore style as an improvisation-heavy filmmaker, and his films co-written with Brie are marked by exploration of expectations in film form.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJeffrey Lance Baena was born in Miami on June 29, 1977, to Barbara (later Stern) and Scott Baena. He was raised in a secular Jewish family in the suburbs of Kendall and Coral Gables, where he enjoyed being surrounded by Latin and Caribbean cultures; he later said that he \"felt a sense of community\" there, a contrast to the negative perception of drug cartel violence. Baena's great-grandparents, who were Spanish speakers born in Turkey, had owned a farm in upstate New York; his parents were from New York City and had moved to Miami due to his father's work. His father is a lawyer who was appointed to the Committee for Economic Development by Richard Nixon as a college senior before moving into bankruptcy law. Baena's parents were divorced, which he credited in part with informing his dark sense of comedy. His first stepmother was manic depressive and, under Florida's Baker Act, was frequently institutionalized but then released, with Baena later commenting on systemic challenges in mental health care. He had a brother and two step-siblings.\nAfter attending Killian High School, Baena graduated from the New York University Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in film, before moving to Los Angeles to pursue directing. Without planning to do so, he achieved a minor in medieval studies at NYU after taking multiple classes when he \"was hard-core into the alchemy shit\". He also took classes relating to philosophy.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1999–2012: Early career ===\nBaena was a production assistant for filmmaker Robert Zemeckis on What Lies Beneath and Cast Away (both 2000). The films were shot back-to-back and Zemeckis then took a production break, causing Baena to seek other employment. He became an assistant editor and, later, personal assistant for writer-director David O. Russell. Baena was originally hired to help edit an online documentary, Benny Hernandez, before Russell asked him to contribute some writing ideas for it; the project was ultimately left unfinished. After a year and a half of working together, a minor car accident injured one of Baena's eyes. Partially to keep his spirits up and pass the time during his recovery, Russell began discussing story ideas with Baena. The two ended up collaborating on four scripts together, including I Heart Huckabees, which Russell directed in 2004, and Jay Roach's Meet the Fockers (also 2004), for which they made uncredited revisions. The philosophical I Heart Huckabees was noted for the ambition in its storytelling; it was not a commercial success, and polarized critics. By 2005 it had become a cult hit, and soon found a place in the pop culture zeitgeist. In 2023, Robbie Collin and Tim Robey wrote in The Telegraph that it was one of the best box-office bombs, citing its rewatchability two decades later.\nBefore he began directing, Baena continued working as a screenwriter, mostly for studio assignments and rewrites. Warner Bros. Pictures appointed him the screenwriter for the comedy The Awakening of Jean-Luc Barbara in 2006, which was still in development in 2010. He performed rewrites on Rami and Etan Cohen's Revenge of the Jocks, a reverse take on Revenge of the Nerds, in 2011. At the same time he was writing an indie adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway memoir A Moveable Feast. Having always wanted to be a director, Baena considered screenwriting \"a means to an end\" and was critical of his own writing ability. In 2012, he co-judged a short film script competition curated by Roman Coppola, and played a fictionalized version of himself in the film The End of Love; a dramatization of actor Mark Webber's life, Baena appeared in The End of Love alongside Aubrey Plaza, his partner and Webber's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World co-star.\n\n\n=== 2012–2017: Directorial debut and producing with Destro ===\n\nBaena had planned for the comedy-drama Joshy to be his directorial debut, but actor and collaborator Adam Pally had to postpone for personal reasons. Baena then decided to work on the zombie comedy Life After Beth, from a script he started writing in 2003, which became his debut. This film had been in production but shelved shortly after it was written, and was only picked back up after comic actress Aubrey Plaza was looking for a role and her agent remembered the script; with Plaza attached, the production resumed. Flavorwire wrote that \"Baena's control of the material is occasionally uncertain\", while Mark Kermode felt Baena \"kept things just the right side of believable, eschewing explanation in favour of cracked domesticity.\" Life After Beth received mixed reviews; the Rotten Tomatoes (RT) critics' consensus suggested the idea was too thin to sustain a whole film, though bolstered by Plaza's performance. In 2016, it was ranked the 38th best ever zombie film and described as both \"the best zom-rom-com since Shaun Of The Dead\" and a \"mumblecore relationship break-up zomcom\". It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014, the same festival at which Joshy, as Baena's second film, premiered in 2016.\nAfter Life After Beth, Baena worked on adapting Lysergic, the autobiography of Krystle Cole that he had optioned, and suggested he might like to direct Doctor Strange as he was a fan of the character. When production resumed on Joshy, Baena provided his large comedic cast with a 20-page outline, rather than a script, as an experiment to \"keep people in the moment.\" Baena did not audition but cast people he knew would be able to work in such a film. The film's RT critics' consensus highlighted Baena's direction for \"strik[ing] a unique, disarmingly heartfelt blend of dark humor and tragedy\". The Los Angeles Times praised that despite its improvisational nature, \"the film never feels unfocused or messy\"; Christy Lemire felt Baena's work had improved since his debut; and Glenn Kenny noted Baena's skill in tonally dictating his film. Joshy was ranked the fifth best ever mumblecore film separately by screenwriter Jason Hellerman and critic Mike Bedard, with Bedard also describing it as \"post-mumblecore\".\nJake Johnson as well as some of Baena's filmmaker friends had acting roles in Joshy; the previous year, Baena had similarly made a cameo in Johnson's 2015 film Digging for Fire, the premise of which was based on the strange things found when Johnson, Baena and friends had dug out Johnson's garden. Joshy was Baena's first film to feature actress Alison Brie, albeit briefly, before she had a main role in his third film, the 2017 black comedy The Little Hours. Plaza also starred in The Little Hours, for whom it was her producing debut. She produced alongside Liz Destro of Destro Films, who had produced Baena's previous films; Baena only proceeded to develop The Little Hours after pitching it to Destro. Inspired by passages from The Decameron, which Baena had studied, the film was again largely improvised and based in the disconnect of medieval beliefs to modern ones; Baena saw the potential for humor and tragedy in this idea. Reviews were impressed with how well the concept worked, and praised Baena's comedic direction, with Mick LaSalle writing that \"Baena combines a zany comic vision with a rare control of tone. [...] There's no winking or nudging, no straining for laughs. Baena devised the material, and he trusts it.\"\n\n\n=== 2018–2022: Creative partnership with Alison Brie ===\nBaena directed Brie two more times in the films Horse Girl (2020) and Spin Me Round (2022), which they co-wrote together. The latter also featured Plaza. Both actresses were involved in different capacities in Baena's only television work, Cinema Toast, a 2021 anthology series that he created and executive produced. Baena wrote and directed episodes in the series, which reinterpreted public domain footage to tell modern stories. Baena and Brie were among the producers for Cinema Toast and both of their co-written films, all of which were executive produced by the Duplass Brothers.\n\nHaving formed a friendship after working on previous movies, and knowing of the creative risks Baena liked to take, Brie pitched the idea for a drama about fear of mental illness to him while on a hike. He had been suggesting that she play a \"horse girl\" character, and they realized they could combine the ideas to create what became Horse Girl. The pair pitched it to the Duplass Brothers, who joined and offered it to Netflix. Baena and Brie wrote the screenplay together, and some of the film's dialogue was improvised. After premiering at Sundance in 2020, Horse Girl began streaming on Netflix and was the most commercially successful of Baena's works. Reviews noted the use and subversion of form to inform the story, which was generally praised but also criticized by Adrian Horton in The Guardian.\nThe pair again chose to subvert expectations in Spin Me Round, the shoot of which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. They used the delay to expand the film outline into a more detailed script. The film combined comedy and thriller genres, and critics noted the story for \"a provocative #MeToo statement\". Spin Me Round saw mixed reviews, its RT critics' consensus saying that \"it never quite lives up to its potential\" but is nevertheless enjoyable and elevated by Plaza and Brie. The Hollywood Reporter felt it was \"amusing but the most lightweight\" of Baena's films.\n\n\n=== Style ===\nIn his own words, Baena described his films as \"destabilizing, unmoored, and full of chaos\"; literary author William Deresiewicz wrote they are \"odd, generically hybrid, tonally complex\". Ryan Gilbey wrote in an obituary for The Guardian that despite some similarities and all sharing \"some unforeseen emotional kick, the subjects and styles [of Baena's films] were strikingly dissimilar\"; Gilbey added that Baena planned this intention, as he did not want to do the same thing more than once. Baena enjoyed creative freedom to mix genres and expectations, and preferred not to use labels for his works so as to not create generic expectations. He was considered one of the prominent filmmakers of the mumblecore subgenre. His films found a cult audience, while critics acknowledged his consistent attention to topics that were not frequently tackled in Hollywood movies: Baena's films broadly deal with themes of grief, loss, love and mental health.\nHe \"never really audition[ed], ever\" for his films, saying he was inspired by Federico Fellini choosing performers based on seeing them in a more natural setting than a line reading. Baena created ideas of characters then, once he knew which actors he would use, would \"try to build the part around them, and ... make it more true.\" He ended up with a group of frequent collaborators, particularly Brie, Plaza, Molly Shannon, Lauren Weedman and Paul Reiser (who each starred in four of his five films) – this was primarily because Baena enjoyed working with them and wanted to bring out new things from actors he enjoyed. In discussing his actor collaborations, Baena cited an ability to move seamlessly between comedy and drama as a common attribute. He also found it advantageous to work with familiar actors due to his own \"slightly nontraditional way\" of writing and directing, so that he could rely on performers who understood his process. Baena typically wrote and worked from film outlines, rather than full screenplays, so his films could incorporate improvisation, though his first and final films, Life After Beth and Spin Me Round, were more traditional.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n\nBaena was renowned for the game nights he hosted, creating a social environment among filmmakers and friends that was reflected on his film sets. He met actress Aubrey Plaza during a game night in 2011, after which they began dating. Baena proposed to Plaza at a site related to the Basque witch trials in Zugarramurdi. They were married in 2021, to celebrate their tenth anniversary together, in a small ceremony in their backyard. They quietly separated in September 2024 after experiencing marital difficulties, with Plaza staying in New York. Baena began attending therapy in October after he made \"concerning remarks\" to Plaza, which prompted her to call a friend to perform a welfare check on him.\nOn January 3, 2025, Baena's body was discovered at his home in Los Angeles by his dog walker; he was last known to be alive at 10:36 a.m. EST that morning. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The Los Angeles County medical examiner reported the cause of death as suicide by hanging. Baena was 47. According to the medical examiner's report, Baena had no previous suicide attempts. The 82nd Golden Globe Awards ceremony was held on January 5, with Best Director winner Brady Corbet paying tribute to Baena at the end of his acceptance speech; Plaza had been set to present at the ceremony but pulled out. Baena's funeral took place on January 10, 2025, in Miami.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== As creator ===\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\n\n=== Others ===\nActing roles\n\nOther credits\n\n\n=== Unrealized projects ===\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJeff Baena at IMDb",

        "title": "Kelly Clarkson",
        "content": "Kelly Brianne (born Kelly Brianne Clarkson, April 24, 1982), known professionally as Kelly Clarkson, is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. Rising to fame after winning the first season of American Idol, she has established a multi-decade career in music and television and is credited with having a lasting impact on televised talent shows. Known as a vocal powerhouse and versatile performer, she was named one of the greatest singers in history by publications such as Rolling Stone and Billboard.\nSigned to RCA Records in 2002, Clarkson released her chart-topping debut single, \"A Moment Like This\", which became the best-selling single of the year in the US. Her R&B and gospel-influenced debut album, Thankful (2003), entered the US Billboard 200 at number one. Clarkson shifted genres to pop rock for Breakaway (2004), one of the 21st century's best-selling albums. Its singles, \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", were among the top ten charted songs of 2005 in the US, while \"Because of You\" topped the charts in Europe. After the lukewarm reception to My December (2007), with its darker rock music, Clarkson returned to radio-friendly pop rock sounds with All I Ever Wanted (2009) and Stronger (2011), which each produced number-one singles \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" and \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\", respectively.\nClarkson ventured into Christmas music with Wrapped in Red (2013), which became the best-selling holiday album of the year and featured \"Underneath the Tree\", American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP)'s most popular Christmas song released in the 21st century. Following the release of the number-one album Piece by Piece (2015), she signed with Atlantic Records and recorded three further albums titled Meaning of Life (2017), When Christmas Comes Around... (2021), and Chemistry (2023), with the latter serving as her final release on a major label. Clarkson returned to television as a coach on The Voice for nine seasons between 2018 and 2023. She remains the female coach with the most winning contestants (four) in the show's history. Since 2019, she has hosted her own talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show.\nWith over 82 million records worldwide, Clarkson is one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has received various accolades, including three Grammy Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, four American Music Awards, eight Daytime Emmy Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Billboard ranked her as the Top Female Artist of 2005 and the 11th most successful female artist of the 21st century. Clarkson's first seven studio albums generated a total of 12 top-ten hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart between 2002 and 2024, as well as 10 top-ten singles in the UK, Canada, and Australia. Having a crossover appeal on various radio formats, she became the first act in history to top each of Billboard's pop, adult contemporary, country, and dance airplay charts. VH1 ranked her nineteenth on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nKelly Brianne Clarkson was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to Jeanne Ann (née Rose), a first-grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson (1951–2018), a former engineer. She has an older brother, Jason, and an older sister, Alyssa. The three have two younger half-brothers from their father's second marriage. Stephen and Jeanne divorced when Clarkson was six years old, whereupon her brother went to live with their father, her sister went to live with an aunt, and she stayed with their mother. Clarkson's mother later married Jimmy Taylor. Clarkson is of English, Welsh, Irish, and Greek descent. Jeanne is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose (Rose's background was discussed on Clarkson's episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2013). Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist. She has said, \"I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I've always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I've just gotten a lot closer just because He's the only one I can lean on.\" She later said of her upbringing, \"My family was highly conservative; I had to go to church on Sunday and Wednesday.\"\nClarkson grew up in Burleson, Texas and was educated at Pauline Hughes Middle School. In the seventh grade, the school's choir teacher, Cynthia Glenn, overheard her singing in a hallway and asked her to audition for the school choir. Clarkson told her she had never received any professional vocal training. Clarkson graduated from Burleson High School in 2000, where she performed in several musicals, such as Annie Get Your Gun, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and Brigadoon. Clarkson started voice training, hoping to secure a college scholarship in music.\nAfter graduating from high school, Clarkson declined full scholarships to the University of Texas at Austin, University of North Texas, and Berklee College of Music. She declined them saying, \"I'd already written so much music and wanted to try on my own... I figured you're never too old to go to college.\" She worked several jobs to finance a demo, recording material and trying to market it to record labels, but she received little response. Clarkson turned down two recording contracts from Jive Records and Interscope Records, saying, \"They would have completely pigeonholed me as a bubblegum act. I was confident enough that something better would come along.\" In 2001, she traveled to Los Angeles, pursuing a career in music. She appeared as an extra in a few television series such as Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and Dharma & Greg, and briefly worked with musician Gerry Goffin to record five demo tracks in an effort to secure a record deal. According to Clarkson, her early attempts to launch her music career floundered when she was turned down by almost every U.S. record label for sounding \"too black\". Lack of other career opportunities and a fire incident in her apartment forced Clarkson to return to Burleson, where she worked different jobs.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2002–2003: American Idol, World Idol, and Thankful ===\n\nUpon returning to Burleson, Clarkson was encouraged by her friends to audition for the first season of the reality television series American Idol: The Search for a Superstar in May 2002. Despite receiving a \"golden ticket\", a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred to the first season as \"ghetto\", explaining: \"On our season we were like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever changing every day. They did one season of Pop Idol in the UK, but America is a very different market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'. I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress.\" Clarkson went on to win the competition on September 4, 2002, at the Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini.\nImmediately after winning American Idol, Clarkson was signed to a record deal with RCA Records, 19 Recordings, and S Records by talent manager Simon Fuller, who created American Idol, and music mogul Clive Davis, who was slated to executive-produce her debut album. On September 17, 2002, her debut double-A-side single, \"Before Your Love\"/\"A Moment Like This\", was released. Both songs were performed by Clarkson during the season finale of American Idol. After debuting at number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the single climbed to number 52 the following week, and subsequently ascended to number one. It broke a 38-year-old record set by the British band The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one. It eventually went on to become the best-selling single of 2002 in the United States.\n\nClarkson's debut album, Thankful, was released on April 15, 2003. The album contained aspects of pop, contemporary R&B, and gospel music, with several established musicians such as Rhett Lawrence, Diane Warren, The Underdogs, and Babyface contributing on to the tracks. Released during a time of urban-R&B dominance, the album was well received by several critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for its vocal ability: \"throughout this record, (Clarkson) makes it seem effortless and charming. She can croon, she can belt out a song, she can be sexy and sassy while still being graceful and as wholesome as the girl next door.\" Henry Goldblatt of Entertainment Weekly remarked: \"Clarkson glides through octaves with the masterful control of someone who's been doing this for decades.\" Thankful was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and went on to sell over 4.5 million copies worldwide. It was later certified double platinum by the RIAA, platinum in Canada, and gold in Japan and Australia. Billboard ranked Clarkson 10th in their Top Pop Artist (female) list of 2003.\nIts lead single, \"Miss Independent\", became her first international hit, reaching the top ten in five national charts, including the US. It was later certified gold by the RIAA. It earned Clarkson her first Grammy Award nomination for \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\" at the 46th Grammy Awards. It was followed with two moderately successful singles, \"Low\" and \"The Trouble with Love Is\"; the latter was used on the soundtrack of British romantic film Love Actually. Her first video album, Miss Independent, was released on November 18, 2003, and was certified gold by the RIAA. To support Thankful, Clarkson and Idol second season runner-up Clay Aiken co-headlined the 2004 Independent Tour throughout the US.\nClarkson made her film debut with Guarini with the release of the musical romantic comedy film From Justin to Kelly in June 2003. The film was poorly received by critics and was unsuccessful at the box office, with Clarkson explaining that she was \"contractually obligated\" to do the film and didn't like it. In 2002, Clarkson, along with American Idol judges Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson and hosts Brian Dunkleman and Ryan Seacrest, participated in the season premiere of the eighth season of the television comedy series MADtv. She also portrayed Brenda Lee in two episodes of the television drama American Dreams between 2003 and 2004. On December 25, 2003, Clarkson participated in the television special competition World Idol in London, along with the first winners of the several Idol television series around the world. Clarkson was contractually obligated to participate, and she performed Aretha Franklin's \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\". She ended up as the runner-up with 97 points, behind the first Norwegian Idol Kurt Nilsen.\n\n\n=== 2004–2006: New management and Breakaway ===\n\nTrying to distance herself from her American Idol image, Clarkson decided to leave Fuller and 19 Management and hired the services of talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm. She reinvented herself to some extent, developing a more rock-oriented sound with her second studio album, Breakaway. Davis served as the executive producer for the record, while Clarkson co-wrote six of the tracks with pop and rock songwriters such as former Evanescence band members Ben Moody and David Hodges, Kara DioGuardi, Dr. Luke and Max Martin. Breakaway received critical acclaim, with Erlewine of AllMusic remarking: \"What gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off, and they are the tracks that illustrate Clarkson is a rare thing in the 2000s: a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream.\"\nBreakaway was released on November 30, 2004, and became Clarkson's most commercially successful album. After debuting at number three on the Billboard 200, its longevity allowed it to become the third-best-selling album of 2005 in the US and was certified sextuple platinum by the RIAA. The album also enjoyed success throughout the world; it topped the charts in the Netherlands and Ireland, became the world's seventh-best-selling album of 2005 and went on to sell more than twelve million copies worldwide. Clarkson was named the Top Female Artist of the Year by Billboard. She promoted the album with the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and Addicted Tour which took place from 2005 to 2006.\nFive singles were released to promote Breakaway. Its title track, \"Breakaway\", was originally released in July 2004, as the soundtrack for Disney film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and was later re-released as the album's fifth single in May 2006. It became Clarkson's third top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 with a peak of number six. It was a major success on adult contemporary radio, topping the Billboard Adult Contemporary for 21 weeks and the Adult Contemporary Audience chart for 28 weeks (her longest number one on any charts). \"Since U Been Gone\" was released as the album's lead single in November 2004 and became Clarkson's most successful single on the Hot 100 despite peaking at number two. The second and third singles, \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" and \"Because of You\", also followed suit—peaking at number six and number seven on the Hot 100, respectively. \"Because of You\" became Clarkson's biggest single worldwide, reaching number one on the European Hot 100 Singles chart and the national charts in Brazil, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Switzerland. The fourth single, \"Walk Away\", peaked at number twelve on the Hot 100. According to Mediabase, Clarkson was the most-played artist of 2006 in the U.S.\nBreakaway garnered Clarkson many accolades, including two trophies at the 48th Grammy Awards—the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Since U Been Gone\" and the Best Pop Vocal Album. She also won Best Female Video two years in a row, for \"Since U Been Gone\" and \"Because of You\", at the MTV Video Music Awards. Clarkson's second video album, Behind Hazel Eyes, was released on March 29, 2005. In 2005, she performed and participated during the thirtieth season of the American sketch-comedy series, Saturday Night Live, and the reality series Damage Control with Simple Plan frontman Pierre Bouvier. She performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Game 2 of the NBA Finals. She performed during the festivities All-Star Game and the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy; In 2006, Clarkson recorded \"Go\" as a free download for the Ford Motor Company advertising campaign.\n\n\n=== 2007–2009: My December and All I Ever Wanted ===\nClarkson's third studio album, My December, was released on June 22, 2007. The album relied on darker themes and heavier rock music. She replaced Davis as the executive producer and co-wrote all the tracks. She opted to collaborate with her band members rather than her previous producers and collaborators. Its production and release became a subject of a dispute with RCA, particularly with Davis. He noted the album's lack of professional production input and wanted her to re-record tracks with a more mainstream appeal, which she refused. Clarkson defended herself saying, \"I've sold more than 15 million records worldwide, and still nobody listens to what I have to say. I couldn't give a crap about being a star. I've always just wanted to sing and write.\" The album received positive response, but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss Kwatinetz and Live Nation to cancel its accompanying tour, the My December Tour, and reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting acts Jon McLaughlin, Sean Kingston and Mandy Moore. Clarkson later hired talent manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Management. Blackstock was the husband of country artist Reba McEntire, of whom Clarkson is a close friend. Clarkson later issued an apology to Davis, citing him as \"a key advisor\" in her success.\n\nMy December debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA. The album went on to sell over 2.5 million copies worldwide. It featured only one major hit single, \"Never Again\", which debuted and peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100—her highest debut on the chart ever. On July 7, 2007, Clarkson performed on the American leg of Live Earth concert. Clarkson partnered with NASCAR during their 2007 season, appearing in televised advertisements, performed at pre-race concerts, promoted NASCAR Day, and appeared at the Champions' Banquet in December.\nClarkson collaborated with Reba McEntire in an hour-long CMT Crossroads special at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium on February 22, 2007. Introduced by Dolly Parton, Clarkson performed \"Why Haven't I Heard from You\" and \"Does He Love You\" with Martina McBride on the television special CMT Giants: Reba McEntire. She also appeared on an episode of McEntire's sitcom Reba, which aired on January 14, 2007. At the Academy of Country Music Awards on May 16, 2007, Clarkson and McEntire sang a country version of \"Because of You\", which also became the lead single from the album Reba: Duets. It peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Throughout 2008, Clarkson and McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour to support Reba: Duets and My December.\n\nClarkson's fourth album, All I Ever Wanted, was released on March 6, 2009. Clarkson continued to co-write her own material, but this time she returned to a mainstream-oriented sound by reuniting with previous collaborators Dr. Luke, Martin, and DioGuardi, and new collaborators Howard Benson, Claude Kelly, Ryan Tedder, Glen Ballard, Matt Thiessen and Katy Perry in contributing tracks for the album. The release of All I Ever Wanted was met with positive acclaim from music critics for its lighter themes. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and remaining there for two weeks. The album has sold over a million copies in the U.S. and garnered Clarkson a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.\nIts first single, \"My Life Would Suck Without You\", became an international hit. It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 97 and rose to the top position the following week, breaking the record for the biggest jump to number one in a single week previously held by Britney Spears' \"Womanizer\". It also topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Hungary. It was followed with two more top-twenty singles, \"I Do Not Hook Up\" and \"Already Gone\". The release of \"Already Gone\" became a subject of another dispute between Clarkson and RCA, after she realized its similarities with Beyoncé's song \"Halo\", both of which were produced by Tedder. Further promotion for the album was abruptly ended with the limited success of its fourth and final singles, \"All I Ever Wanted\" and \"Cry\". Clarkson supported All I Ever Wanted with the All I Ever Wanted Tour from 2009 to 2010. She also performed as one of many main artists for the return of VH1 Divas in September 2009. Clarkson became a guest mentor on the Dutch television series X Factor in November 2009.\n\n\n=== 2010–2012: Stronger, Duets, and Greatest Hits – Chapter One ===\n\nClarkson recorded a country duet with Jason Aldean, \"Don't You Wanna Stay\", for his 2010 album My Kinda Party. It became her first number-one song on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and has sold over 2.7 million copies, making it the best-selling country collaboration in history. It received numerous country-related accolades, including a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards. Clarkson incorporated a slight country vibe into her fifth studio album, Stronger, which was also influenced by Prince, Tina Turner, Sheryl Crow, and Radiohead. She worked with several producers including Greg Kurstin, Ester Dean, Darkchild, Toby Gad, Steve Jordan, and Howard Benson. Released on October 21, 2011, Stronger debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the RIAA. It was also critically applauded and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards, making her the first artist to win the award twice.\n\nStronger's lead single, \"Mr. Know It All\", was released in September 2011. It reached number one in Australia and South Korea and attained a top-ten position in seven countries, including the U.S., where it became her ninth top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also became a crossover hit to the country charts, prompting RCA to reissue a country version. \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" served as the second single in January 2012, and topped sixteen Billboard charts, becoming her third number one on the Hot 100. It also reached number one in Poland and Slovakia and reached the top ten in many other charts worldwide. It remains Clarkson's best-selling single, with 4.9 million copies sold in the U.S. alone. The song was nominated for three Grammy Awards—Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance. \"Dark Side\" was released as the third and final single in June 2012, and it achieved a modest success. It became her eleventh top-ten hit on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart, and she surpassed Sheryl Crow and Katy Perry as the female artist with the most top-ten songs on the chart.\nThe release of Stronger was accompanied by two EPs, The Smoakstack Sessions and iTunes Session. The latter debuted at number 85 on the Billboard 200, and it was promoted by its only single, a cover of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\". Clarkson co-wrote \"Tell Me a Lie\", which was recorded by British boy band One Direction for their debut album, Up All Night (2011). Clarkson promoted Stronger with two concert tours, the Stronger Tour and the co-headlining the Kelly Clarkson / The Fray Tour with the alternative rock band The Fray. On February 5, 2012, she performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XLVI to widespread critical acclaim. She later released a promotional single, \"Get Up (A Cowboys Anthem)\", for use in Pepsi's NFL advertising campaign.\nClarkson served as a mentor and judge, alongside John Legend, Jennifer Nettles, and Robin Thicke, on the ABC television show Duets, which premiered on May 24, 2012. The show concluded on July 19, 2012, with Clarkson's contestant Jason Farol finishing as the second runner-up. She also became a guest mentor to Blake Shelton's team on the second season of The Voice. The two later collaborated on a cover of \"There's a New Kid in Town\" for Shelton's 2012 Christmas album, Cheers, It's Christmas.\nCommemorating the 10th anniversary of her career in music, Clarkson released her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One, on November 19, 2012. Three new songs were recorded for the compilation—\"Catch My Breath\", \"Don't Rush\" (featuring country musician Vince Gill) and \"People Like Us\"—were all released as singles. \"Catch My Breath\" became her 14th top-twenty hit on the Hot 100 chart as well as her 13th million-selling single in the United States. According to Billboard, it was the third biggest adult contemporary song of 2013. However, its follow-up singles performed moderately well on the charts. Clarkson earned more nominations from the country music industry, including Best Country Duo/Group Performance for \"Don't Rush\" at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards and Female Vocalist of the Year at the 2012 Country Music Association Awards. Chapter One was eventually certified gold in Australia, the UK and the U.S.\n\n\n=== 2013–2015: Wrapped in Red and Piece by Piece ===\n\nIn January 2013, Clarkson performed \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" at the second inauguration of U.S. President Barack Obama. Her live rendition was acclaimed by critics, who contrasted it with Beyoncé's pre-recorded performance during the same event. In February 2013, she performed \"Tennessee Waltz\" and \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards as a tribute to Patti Page and Carole King. She also released a non-album single, \"Tie It Up\", exclusively to country music stations in June 2013. Clarkson and Maroon 5 performed at 24 concerts as part of the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour, starting on August 1, 2013, and ending on October 6, 2013. She was featured on the re-recorded version of \"Foolish Games\" for Jewel's first compilation, Greatest Hits (2013). Clarkson also collaborated with singer Robbie Williams on the song \"Little Green Apples\" for his 2013 album Swings Both Ways.\nClarkson's sixth studio album and first Christmas record, Wrapped in Red, was solely produced by Greg Kurstin. She co-wrote all five original songs and recorded eleven cover versions of Christmas standards and carols. Released on October 25, 2013, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Holiday Albums and at number three on the Billboard 200 chart. By December 2013, Wrapped in Red had already been certified platinum by the RIAA and eventually became the best-selling holiday album of the year. The album's lead single, \"Underneath the Tree\", was an adult contemporary number-one hit in both the U.S. and Canada. Clarkson subsequently became Billboard's ninth top adult contemporary act of 2013. On December 11, 2013, her first Christmas special debut, Kelly Clarkson's Cautionary Christmas Music Tale, garnered over 5.3 million viewers. In December 2013, Citizen Watch Co. announced Clarkson as their newest Brand Ambassador. Retaining her relationship with country music acts in 2014, Clarkson collaborated with Martina McBride on \"In the Basement\" (originally by Etta James and Sugar Pie DeSanto) for McBride's album Everlasting and with Trisha Yearwood on \"PrizeFighter\" for Yearwood's compilation PrizeFighter: Hit After Hit. Clarkson also performed a rendition of \"All I Ask of You\" with Josh Groban on his seventh studio album, Stages, and its companion television special. She was featured on Ben Haenow's \"Second Hand Heart\", the lead single from his debut studio album.\nIn February 2015, Clarkson released Piece by Piece, her seventh and final studio album under her recording contract with RCA Records. Musically, it is an electropop and dance album, featuring collaborations with Kurstin, Jesse Shatkin, Sia, John Legend, and Shane McAnally, among others. Piece by Piece received a reasonably positive response from music critics and became her third album to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 chart. To promote the album, Clarkson appeared in several televised performances, including the fourteenth season of American Idol, where she became the only alumnus ever to be dedicated with a competing week featuring her discography. She also supported the Piece by Piece Tour throughout 2015, which was cut short of its worldwide visits following medical recommendations for a vocal rest during the year.\nPiece by Piece spawned three singles. The first one, \"Heartbeat Song\", peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became a top-ten hit in the UK, Austria, Poland, and South Africa. However, Clarkson failed to achieve a similar success with the second single, \"Invincible\". The third and final single, \"Piece by Piece\", debuted and peaked at number eight on the Hot 100 chart, following Clarkson's emotional performance on the fifteenth season of American Idol. It became her eleventh U.S. top-ten hit and matched \"Never Again\" as her highest debut on the chart. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, the album and \"Heartbeat Song\" were nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Solo Performance, respectively. At the following year, the title track also received a nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance.\n\n\n=== 2016–2018: Children's books, Meaning of Life, and The Voice ===\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that Clarkson had signed a book deal with HarperCollins. Her first children's book, River Rose and the Magical Lullaby was released on October 4, 2016. The book features an original lullaby written and performed by Clarkson. On the possibility of writing any more books in the future, Clarkson told Publishers Weekly, \"I've got a few ideas – there could be a lullaby for each book. We've got a plethora of stories, and I've already written seven songs, full out, so we'll just have to see which ones might pan out to be a book. But yes, there will definitely be more.\" The second book featuring River Rose, River Rose and the Magical Christmas, was released on October 24, 2017, and included an original song written and sung by Clarkson, \"Christmas Eve\".\n\nOn March 15, 2016, First Lady Michelle Obama released \"This Is for My Girls\", a collaborative track featuring vocals from Clarkson, Janelle Monáe, Kelly Rowland, Lea Michele, Zendaya, and Missy Elliott to coincide with Barack Obama's SXSW speech and to promote the First Lady's third-world educational initiative Let Girls Learn. Clarkson recorded a solo version of \"It's Quiet Uptown\" for The Hamilton Mixtape. Her version was released on November 3, 2016, as a promotional single for the album. She also recorded a duet called \"Love Goes On\" with Aloe Blacc for the original soundtrack of The Shack, which was released in the United States on March 3, 2017. On May 11, 2017, it was announced that Clarkson would join The Voice as a coach for the series' fourteenth season.\nOn June 24, 2016, Clarkson announced she had signed a long-term worldwide deal with Atlantic Records, with the intentions of releasing a soul-influenced eighth studio album in 2017.

After taking the twenty-second season of The Voice off, it was announced in October 2022 that she would return for the twenty-third season in 2023. She covered the Cole Porter song, \"Don't Fence Me In\" on \nJeff Goldblum and The Mildred Snitzer Orchestra's EP, Play Well with Others, which was released in March 2023.\nOn March 26, 2023, she announced her tenth studio album, Chemistry, which was released on June 23, 2023.

On December 4, 2024, she returned to host and perform on NBC's Christmas in Rockefeller Center for the second year in a row.\n\n\n=== 2025: Independent label, new music, and Songs & Stories ===\nIn January 2025, Clarkson revealed on her talk show she had launched her own record label, with plans to release her own music independently for the first time in her career. The following month, Live Nation announced Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions, an eighteen-date residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. On April 18, she announced her new single, \"Where Have You Been\". On May 1, 2025, Clarkson premiered the song exclusively on her Sirius XM channel, the day before it was released worldwide. \nIn July 2025, it was announced that Clarkson would return to The Voice for its twenty-ninth season in the spring of 2026. In August 2025, Clarkson began hosting a new show, Songs & Stories with Kelly Clarkson, which is based on an occasional segment she has on her talk show.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Voice ===\n\nCritics have said Clarkson has a soprano voice. Arion Berger of Rolling Stone wrote that \"her high notes are sweet and pillowy, her growl is bone-shaking and sexy, and her mid-range is amazingly confident.\" In reviewing a live performance of Clarkson's, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said she \"showed off a voice that moved in all sorts of ways, without ever appearing to strain\", continuing \"Ms. Clarkson, who has a malleable voice and a boatload of vocal confidence, might be a soul siren in the making\". However, in a separate review of Stronger, Caramanica said Clarkson's voice is \"too huge, too violent\" for warmer and sweeter vocal stylings, stating \"she's on a par with Taylor Swift when it comes to vengeance, and she'll do it louder and with more brutality in comparison to her contemporary.\" In a live review as part of her Stronger Tour, Sophie Sinclair of Hit The Floor said \"Kelly's strong and powerful voice was flawless throughout the night, and some may even say she sounds better live than she does on her albums\". Mark Deming from Phoenix New Times stated that \"in an era when pop music means over-singing a song into a bloody pulp, Clarkson has consistently displayed both charisma and a welcome sense of restraint, knowing how to sound passionate and heartfelt without forgetting where the melody and the root note is supposed to go.\"\nDr. Luke, who produced some of Clarkson's hits, said \"She has powerful lungs. She's like the Lance Armstrong of vocal cords.\"\nIn an interview with Good Morning America, Simon Cowell was asked of the then six American Idol winners, who he thought had the best voice. Cowell immediately answered that Clarkson did \"by a mile\", noting that she was \"up there\" with other great singers such as Celine Dion. Esquire wrote that Clarkson has \"the best voice in the history of pop music\". Reviewing Stronger, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone states, Clarkson has \"one of music's most remarkable voices.\" Jason Lipshutz from Billboard considered Clarkson as one of the greatest singers in pop music. Regarding the controversial practice of lip-syncing, Clarkson says she never has and never will lip-sync, elaborating in an interview with Cory Myers, \"I've actually never done that because I'm terrified; if I ever did that, something horrible would happen, the track would skip. I have a really unhealthy fear about it. So no, I've never done that\". Clarkson has earned the title \"Queen of Covers\" for her ability to perform songs from artists of various genres.\n\n\n=== Songwriting ===\nIn terms of songwriting, Clarkson has described herself as \"an emotional writer\", explaining that, unlike some of her peers and collaborators, she is unable to write music without a personal connection to the material. She stated, \"I have to be feeling something, going through something, or inspired by something\" in order to create songs, approaching songwriting as an emotional outlet.  Following her 2022 divorce from Brandon Blackstock, Clarkson began performing a revised version of \"Piece by Piece\" during live shows, replacing several references to her ex-husband with lyrics about self-empowerment.\nAt the same time, she prefers not to write in the same location as others artists, opting for privacy and describing herself as \"not a vulnerable writer\". When she is credited for songwriting, she has usually contributed to both lyrics and melody. She considers \"Miss Independent\" to be the first song that helped establish her as a songwriter, setting a precedent for her career and paving the way for other songs she would write or co-write. In 2013, Clarkson published an open letter disputing claims made by Davis in his memoir The Soundtrack of My Life. Davis had written that Clarkson cried hysterically in his office after being pressured to record \"Since U Been Gone\". Clarkson countered that she became emotional not over that song, but in response to remarks Davis allegedly made about her songwriting on \"Because of You\", including criticism that its lyrics did not rhyme and suggesting that she \"should just shut up and sing\". She also criticized Davis for omitting his role in blaming the underperformance of My December on its lack of radio-friendly singles and her involvement in its songwriting.\nClarkson has stated that there have been several instances throughout her career where she declined songwriting credit on songs, despite making changes to them. However, she noted that she will typically request credit if she believes her contributions warrant it. In 2017, Clarkson said that she refused songwriting credit on \"My Life Would Suck Without You\", one of her biggest hits, as a form of protest against being forced by her record label to work with producer Dr. Luke after expressing that she had not enjoyed working with him prior. She has suggested that by doing so, she may have forfeited millions of dollars in potential royalties, but maintains that she is against recording artists stealing credit from professional songwriters.\n\n\n=== Influences ===\n\nAt age eight, Clarkson was first inspired to venture into music during a visit to an African-American church in Fort Worth, Texas. She recalled: \"I was like, 'Wow, whatever they're feeling, I want to feel it too'.\" Clarkson has been influenced by musicians across various genres. She cited soul singer Aretha Franklin as her major influence. Many of her chosen Idol numbers were Aretha Franklin covers, including \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\", which is considered her breakout moment during the competition. Other soul acts who influenced Clarkson were Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Etta James and Stevie Wonder. Clarkson was also influenced by Christina Aguilera, by rock acts such as Radiohead, Garbage, Aerosmith, and Jimi Hendrix, as well as Reba McEntire, Bette Midler, and Rosemary Clooney. Regarding her musical influence, Clarkson explained:\n\nI grew up with three totally different parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis and all that kind of stuff. And my real father is into Whitney and Mariah, and Aretha, all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra [Streisand], Bette Midler, all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like ten years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.\nIn 2006, Clarkson said she does not consider herself to be a pop singer, explaining, \"Rock is what I love\". Clarkson often covers rock songs on her Kellyoke segment of her talk show, such as Metallica's \"Sad but True\", and Heart's \"Crazy on You\".\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\nClarkson has scored over 100 number ones on the Billboard charts and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Clarkson has sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide, including 14 million albums and 35 million digital singles in the United States alone. She became the first artist to top each of Billboard's pop, adult contemporary, country and dance charts. She was ranked nineteenth on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Women in Music. Television channel Fuse included Clarkson among \"30 Greatest Musicians to Come From Singing Competitions\" list. Rolling Stone ranked her 194 on their list of 200 Best Singers of All Time in 2023. In 2025, Billboard ranked Clarkson at number 11 on its \"Top 100 Women Artists of the 21st Century\" list.\nMusic executive Simon Cowell believed that \"What [Clarkson] sold in the UK, Europe, Asia had nothing to do with American Idol. It had everything to do with the fact that she made a great record and she's got an incredible voice. She's not a girl who got lucky in a talent competition; we got lucky to find her.\" According to The Hollywood Reporter, Clarkson is \"the embodiment of the perfect pop star. Her unmistakable pipes are a powerful presence in top 40 and country, with forays into anthemic rock and dance.\" Nolan Feeney from Time asserted that Clarkson \"has had more of a lasting impact on the pop music landscape than casual listeners might realize.\"\nAccording to Billboard, Clarkson was a \"phenomenon\" who \"helped legitimize\" the impact of talent shows. The Washington Post wrote that \"Clarkson's powerhouse voice and dynamic presence signaled that the music industry should take these reality show contestants seriously: Her first two albums, Thankful and Breakaway, sold about ten million copies combined, and her pop tunes became empowerment anthems across the globe.\" In 2007, journalist Nekesa Mumbi Moody reported that the success of Breakaway in particular was the true pivotal moment in establishing American Idol's credibility, proving that the show was capable of \"finding someone who would have a career with longevity\". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday believed Clarkson \"has set the standard for all singing competition contestants with her savvy mix of pop, rock and country.\"\nFox Broadcasting Company said that Clarkson gave \"lasting credibility\" to American Idol and \"in so many ways she cleared a road\" for all of the next contestants. George Varga from The San Diego Union-Tribune underlined the difference of Clarkson from most other talent show contestants is that she \"writes or co-writes a fair number of [her] own songs. She is also the only one whose quest to follow her artistic instincts—the better to rock out and break free from the Idol cookie-cutter pop mold—prompted her to fire her management team and engage in a prolonged public battle with her record company, RCA.\"\nJon Lisi from PopMatters named Clarkson as one of the forces of female domination in pop music of the 2000s. He explained that \"Clarkson's anti-sexual image appealed to those who were uncomfortable with Britney Spears' overt exhibitionism. When Clarkson performed 'Since U Been Gone' at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, for instance, she only showed her midriff, and it was clear that she was marketing herself to an alternative group of young females who liked pop music's conventional sound but didn't want to be confronted with sexual imagery.\" Mickey Rapkin of Billboard magazine, who called Clarkson a role model and compared her vocals to golden-era Aretha Franklin, stated that Clarkson \"has never shied away from speaking her mind, whether in her propulsive pop anthems or on her filter-free Twitter feed.\" Clarkson has influenced other artists including Vanessa Hudgens, Demi Lovato, Ava Max, Jordin Sparks, Ashley Tisdale, Avril Lavigne, Kelsea Ballerini, and Priscilla Block.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn February 2012, Clarkson began dating talent manager Brandon Blackstock, son of her former manager Narvel Blackstock and former stepson of Reba McEntire. She and Blackstock married on October 20, 2013, at Blackberry Farm in Walland, Tennessee. During their marriage, Brandon was her manager. Together, they had a daughter, born in June 2014, and a son, born in April 2016. In June 2020, Clarkson filed for divorce from Blackstock, citing irreconcilable differences. In March 2022, it was reported their divorce had been finalized. On November 21, 2023, Clarkson was awarded more than $2.6 million from her ex-husband for commissions paid to him for business deals he procured as her manager. The California Labor Commissioner ruled that Blackstock violated the state's Talent Agencies Act by handling these deals, which should have been managed by Clarkson's talent agents at Creative Artists Agency. The ruling included commissions from Clarkson's role on The Voice and other promotional agreements, but did not require repayment for deals related to The Kelly Clarkson Show. Blackstock died of melanoma on August 7, 2025, at the age of 48.\nIn October 2019, Clarkson said that she has been managing an autoimmune condition and a thyroid condition since 2006, which she had previously addressed on Today in 2018.\nIn February 2022, Clarkson changed her legal name to Kelly Brianne. In an interview, she revealed the name change was for her personal life, while her public name would remain the same. Clarkson stated the reason behind her name change was due to a strained relationship with her late father.\n\n\n=== Political views ===\nIn 2011, Clarkson said, \"I am a Republican but I actually voted Democrat last election\", and expressed support for Ron Paul. Clarkson later said she would be voting for Barack Obama in the 2012 United States presidential election, telling the Daily Star, \"I can't support Romney's policies as I have a lot of gay friends and I don't think it's fair they can't get married.\" She added, \"I'm not a hardcore feminist but we can't be going back to the '50s.\"\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election, Clarkson endorsed Hillary Clinton and stated that Donald Trump made her \"genuinely frightened for our nation\". In 2017, Clarkson said she was now a Democrat. \n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\n\nIn April 2007, Clarkson took part in \"Idol Gives Back\", a fundraiser for people in poverty in both Africa and the U.S., performing \"Up to the Mountain\" along with Jeff Beck. She would also perform a five-song set later that year on the American leg of Live Earth concerts opting for environmental awareness about climate change. She has served as ambassador for the March of Dimes since she was on American Idol, raising money regularly and assisting in volunteer service, having walked for \"March for Babies\", for the cause of improvement of the health of mothers and babies. Clarkson, additionally, got involved in the organization \"Houses of Hope\", who take care and build orphanages for children in South Africa who have been affected by HIV/AIDS, abuse and poverty. She has visited those children and also participated in \"A Night for Hope\" fund-raiser concert (held by Clarkson's background vocal singers, Jill and Kate), where she performed a song she wrote after her trip to South Africa, \"You Still Won't Know What It's Like\". Clarkson also supports the charities Save the Children, UNICEF, \"Do Something\" and \"STOMP Out Bullying\" and music causes like the Save the Music Foundation.\nClarkson had a ranch in Texas for unwanted animals, which included amputee goats, blind dogs, and horses that survived colic; there are more than 80 animals at the sanctuary. She helped provide veterinary care for them and found them an adoptive family. Clarkson performed in a benefit concert on March 1, 2013, supporting the Omaha based Opportunity Education Foundation, an organization that provides access to education for children around the world, stating \"Education was a key part of my childhood, and I am better for it. Anything for education I am really into and especially for kids. A lot of people don't have computers, and they can't afford them. Without education, you get far behind. As long as they have a chance, you know, I think that's important. I want every kid to have a chance.\" In 2013, Clarkson teamed up with State Farm Insurance to support teen safe driving as a part of Celebrate My Drive program. In 2013, Clarkson supported Feeding America, The Ad Council and their Child Hunger PSA Campaign, which provides food for children facing hunger. Also in 2013, Clarkson participated in Green Mountain Coffee's Great Coffee, Good Vibes, Choose Fair Trade campaign by traveling to coffee farms in Peru to draw attention to the importance of being Fair Trade Certified.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\nThankful (2003)\nBreakaway (2004)\nMy December (2007)\nAll I Ever Wanted (2009)\nStronger (2011)\nWrapped in Red (2013)\nPiece by Piece (2015)\nMeaning of Life (2017)\nWhen Christmas Comes Around...

        "title": "Wordle",
        "content": "Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by the Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. In the game, players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, receiving feedback through colored tiles that indicate correct letters and their placement. A single puzzle is released daily, with all players attempting to solve the same word. It was inspired by the English game ‘’Mastermind’’.\nOriginally developed as a personal project for Wardle and his partner, Wordle was publicly released in October 2021. It gained widespread popularity in late 2021 after the introduction of a shareable emoji-based results format, which led to viral discussion on social media. The game's success spurred the creation of numerous clones, adaptations in other languages, and variations with unique twists. It has been well-received, being played 4.8 billion times during 2023.\nThe New York Times Company acquired Wordle in January 2022 for a \"low seven-figure sum\". The game remained free but underwent changes, including the removal of offensive or politically sensitive words and the introduction of account logins to track stats. Wordle was later added to the New York Times Crossword app (later The New York Times Games) and accompanied by WordleBot, which gave players analysis on their gameplay. In November 2022, Tracy Bennett became the game's first editor, refining word selection.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nEvery day, a new five-letter word is chosen, and players attempt to guess it within six tries. After each guess, the letters are color-coded to indicate their accuracy: green means the letter is correct and in the right position, yellow means it is in the word but in the wrong position, and gray means it is not in the word at all. If a guessed word contains multiple instances of the same letter—such as the \"o\"s in \"robot\"—those letters will be marked green or yellow only if the answer also contains them multiple times; otherwise, extra occurrences will be marked gray.\nEach day's answer is drawn from a curated list of 2,309 words. Wordle follows American spelling conventions, and it has a \"hard mode\" option, which requires players to use any revealed green or yellow letters in subsequent guesses. The daily word is the same for all players worldwide. Additionally, the game offers both a dark theme and a high-contrast mode for colorblind accessibility, replacing the standard green and yellow color scheme with orange and blue. \nConceptually and stylistically, the game is similar to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the game show franchise Lingo. The gameplay is also similar to the two-player Word Mastermind variety of the board game Mastermind —and the game \"Bulls and cows\", with the exception that Wordle confirms the specific letters that are correct. According to data collected by The New York Times, the most common first guesses are \"adieu\", \"audio\", \"stare\", \"raise\", and \"arise\". However, it was found that starting words such as \"adieu\" and \"audio\" may put people at a disadvantage as it takes more attempts for people to solve than if they start with words such as \"slate\", \"crane\", and \"trace\". Computer algorithms can consistently solve the puzzle within five of the six allowed guesses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nIn 2013, Josh Wardle created an early prototype of Wordle, initially calling it Mr. Bugs' Wordy Nugz. Inspired by the color-matching mechanics of the board game, Mastermind, the prototype allowed players to solve puzzles consecutively. Originally, the game included all 13,000 five-letter words in the English language, but Wardle found that his partner, Palak Shah, struggled with many obscure words; this made guessing feel as random as it did in Mastermind. To improve the experience, he had Shah filter the list, reducing it to about 2,000 more familiar words—enough to last roughly five years at one puzzle per day. She categorized words into those she knew, those she didn't, and those she might have known. By 2014, Wardle had completed the prototype but eventually lost interest and set it aside.\nIn the years that followed, Wardle created the online social experiments The Button and Place while working for Reddit. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, he and his partner \"got really into\" The New York Times's Spelling Bee and daily crossword puzzle. This reignited his interest in Wordle, and he drew inspiration from Spelling Bee's minimalist web design and its one-puzzle-per-day format. By January 2021, Wardle had published Wordle on the web, shared only with himself and his partner. He named it Wordle as a pun on his surname.\n\n\n=== Rise in popularity ===\nLater he shared it with his relatives, where it \"rapidly became an obsession\" for them. Over the next few months, he introduced the game to close friends, and by mid-October 2021, it began spreading virally. At one point, Wardle discovered that a group of friends in New Zealand had developed an emoji-style display for sharing their results. Inspired by this, he incorporated the feature into the game. After adding the sharing function, Wordle became a viral phenomenon on Twitter in late December 2021.\nSubsequently, the game's player base rose greatly: from 90 players on November 1, 2021 to over 300,000 by January 2, 2022, and more than 2 million a week later. Between January 1 and 13, 1.2 million Wordle results were shared on Twitter. Several media outlets, including CNET and The Indian Express, attributed the game's popularity to its daily puzzle format. Wardle suggested that having one puzzle per day creates a sense of scarcity, leaving players wanting more; he said it encourages players to spend only three minutes on the game each day. He also noted some subtler details about the game, such as the game's keyboard changing to reflect the game state, as reasons for players' enjoyment. Despite its viral success, Wardle stated he had no plans to monetize the game, emphasizing, \"It's not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs ... It's just a game that's fun.\" In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today, Wardle stated that he does not know each day's word so he can still enjoy playing the game himself.\nSeparately, a completely unrelated game called Wordle! by Steven Cravotta—released on the App Store five years before Wardle's Wordle—experienced a surge in downloads due to name confusion. Between January 5 and 12, 2022, Cravotta's game was downloaded over 200,000 times. Recognizing that many users mistakenly believed it to be Wardle's game, Cravotta partnered with Wardle to donate $50,000 in proceeds to Boost, a tutoring charity for Oakland, California, schoolchildren. Google Search also created an Easter egg when one searches for \"Wordle\", with the site's logo becoming an animated game of Wordle to find the word \"Google\". To prevent spoilers, Twitter blocked an auto-reply bot that had been posting the next day's answer in response to players' results.\n\n\n=== Acquisition by the New York Times Company ===\nOn January 31, 2022, the New York Times Company, the parent company of the New York Times, acquired Wordle from Wardle for an \"undisclosed price in the low-seven figures.\" Wardle explained that the overwhelming attention he and his partner had received in the preceding months made them uncomfortable. He was also reluctant to spend time combating the many Wordle clones that had emerged. \"It felt really complicated to me, really unpleasant,\" he said, adding that selling the game allowed him to \"walk away from all of that.\" Jonathan Knight, head of the New York Times games department, first reached out to Wardle on January 5, 2022, just two days after Wordle was featured in a New York Times article. The acquisition was finalized by the end of the month, with chief product officer Alex Hardiman stating, \"I don't think I've ever seen us move on an acquisition this fast.\" Vanity Fair reported that the New York Times narrowly outbid The Washington Post to acquire the game.\nThe New York Times planned to integrate Wordle into its digital puzzle offerings, alongside its crossword and Spelling Bee, as part of its goal to reach 10 million digital subscribers by 2025. The company assured players that the game would initially remain free and that no changes would be made to its core gameplay. However, fans worried that Wordle would eventually be placed behind a paywall. Due to these concerns, some players downloaded the webpage to preserve offline access, as Wordle operates entirely through client-side JavaScript. On February 10, Wordle officially moved to The New York Times website, with player statistics carried over. However, some users reported that their daily streaks had reset after the transition. To integrate the game into the New York Times online platform, developers rebuilt it using React and introduced New York Times account login support as another way to track progress.\nAs part of the transition, the New York Times removed certain words from Wordle's answer list that were deemed insensitive or offensive, including \"slave\" and \"lynch,\" to make the game \"accessible to more people.\" Additionally, they eliminated some British spelling variants, such as \"fibre.\" The New York Times also made real-time changes in response to current events, ensuring Wordle remained separate from the news. In May 2022, the word \"fetus\" was removed from the solution list following the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. By July 2022, a total of seven words had been removed from the original 2,315 Wordle answers, causing the New York Times version to become unsynchronized with older, cached versions of the game. This discrepancy made it difficult for players using different versions to compare scores. \nOn August 24, 2022, Wordle was added to The New York Times Crossword app, with progress synced across mobile and desktop versions, and on April 7, 2022, WordleBot was launched by the New York Times to give players information about how they completed their Wordle on that day, giving a luck and skill rating. Some users felt that the WordleBot responses became patronizing and insulting as the analysis of a player's completed puzzle progressed. According to the New York Times quarterly earnings report ending on March 31, 2022, the acquisition of Wordle brought \"tens of millions\" of new players to the New York Times puzzle site and app, many of whom continued to play the other puzzles offered by the New York Times. Editors in the New York Times games department called the following months the \"Hot Wordle Summer\" due to further increases in players on their games app resulting from Wordle.\nIn collaboration with the New York Times, Hasbro developed Wordle: The Party Game, a physical board game adaptation of the online game. Designed for two to four players, one participant selects a secret word each round while the others attempt to guess it, following Wordle's standard rules. The game was released in October 2022.\n\n\n==== Editor ====\n\nIn November 2022, The New York Times appointed Tracy Bennett as Wordle's dedicated editor, responsible for selecting the daily word from a curated list.\nSpeaking to Today in January 2023, she explained that while the words are initially chosen at random, she reviews each selection for suitability. She removes words that have secondary meanings that could be considered profane or derogatory, as well as those that might be unintentionally hurtful or insensitive. She also avoids words that are particularly difficult to deduce due to having too many common letter combinations—such as found, where the first letter could be one of eight possibilities. \nThe most frequent player complaints, she noted, stemmed from unfamiliar words, \"parer\", \"rupee\" and the U.S.-specific \"condo\". Bennett also introduced a new editorial approach by occasionally aligning the daily word with significant dates. For example, \"BEGIN\" was chosen on her first day as editor, \"MEDAL\" appeared on Veterans Day (November 11), and \"FEAST\" was selected for Thanksgiving (November 24). This thematic connection was not part of Wardle's original word list. However, not all players welcomed this change. Slate's Lizzie O'Leary, for instance, argued that Wordle should \"stay hard and weird,\" preferring the game's original unpredictability.\n\n\n==== Usage ====\nIn 2022, Wordle was the most-searched term on Google worldwide and in the United States. The game's popularity also influenced Google search trends, as players frequently looked up the definitions of daily answers. Seven of the top ten most-searched word definitions that year—cacao, homer, canny, foray, trove, sauté, and tacit—were all Wordle solutions. At the March 2023 Game Developers Conference, New York Times producer Zoe Bell shared insights into Wordle's lasting impact on the company's other online games. While Wordle's player count peaked in March 2022 and later declined, it remained stable at about half of that peak a year later. More significantly, Wordle's popularity has driven increased engagement with other New York Times games, with daily player numbers continuing to rise as of March 2023.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nWordle has garnered generally positive reviews. The Guardian gave it five out of five stars, lauding it as \"a five-minute conundrum that slots pleasingly into even the most harried routine\" and likening it to a daily newspaper puzzle. PC Gamer rated it 80/100 and described it as \"a fantastic, mesmerizing daily puzzle that's bundled to a community offering some of the best vibes on the internet\". Charlie Hall of Polygon criticized the game's board game adaptation, describing it as a \"cut-and-paste job\" that simply replicated the digital game's mechanics without adding meaningful enhancements for a multiplayer party setting.\n\n\n=== Adaptations and clones ===\nFollowing Wordle's rapid rise in early 2022, numerous clones emerged, some introducing novel twists to the game's logic. Absurdle, created by British programmer qntm, is an adversarial version where the target word changes after each guess while still adhering to previously revealed hints. Other clones retained Wordle's mechanics but altered the word list, including translations into other languages and themed variations such as Sweardle (featuring swear words) and Weddle (focused on NFL players, named after former safety Eric Weddle). The game has also been ported to older hardware, with versions like GameBoy Wordle for the Game Boy, Wordle DS for the Nintendo 3DS, and a Nokia N-Gage adaptation.\nBeyond direct clones, many other games adopted the \"-le\" suffix to signal a connection to Wordle, even with significant gameplay differences. These include Semantle, where players guess words based on semantic similarity, and Squabble, a Wordle battle royale. The game's success also spurred a wave of non-word-based variations, such as Worldle, where players identify a country or territory by its silhouette, with text hints indicating direction and distance from the correct answer; Heardle, a music-identification game acquired by Spotify in July 2022; Poeltl (named after NBA player Jakob Pöltl), where players guess an NBA player based on seven characteristics with color-coded feedback similar to Wordle; and Globle, where players guess a country on a map where guesses are colored based on the distance from the correct answer. Some variants expanded Wordle's challenge by requiring players to solve multiple puzzles at once, such as Quordle, which involves solving four puzzles simultaneously and was acquired by Merriam-Webster in January 2023.\nA wave of ad-supported Wordle clones also appeared on Apple's App Store in early January 2022, often using the same name while making minimal changes to the gameplay. However, by the end of the month, nearly all of these clones had been removed. After acquiring Wordle, The New York Times moved to protect its intellectual property by filing a trademark application for the game's name and issuing Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices against GitHub repositories hosting clone source code. The New York Times also initiated legal action against Worldle, a location-based guessing game using a similar format, alleging trademark infringement. The developer of Worldle stated they would contest the claim.\n\n\n==== Others ====\nAfter Wordle gained viral popularity among English-speaking users in January 2022, it was quickly adapted into numerous other languages. An open-source version of the game, created by Hannah Park, was modified by linguist Aiden Pine to accommodate different character sets, enabling broader linguistic accessibility. Pine also published a free step-by-step blog on how to create a custom Wordle. By October 2024, the collaborative project Wordles of the World had documented 780 Wordle-inspired games and resources across 158 languages. These include adaptations in historical and regional dialects, indigenous languages, languages without alphabetic writing systems (such as Chinese chengyu and American Sign Language), and even constructed languages like Klingon.\nThe Brazilian version of the game was developed by Google engineer Fernando Serboncini under the title Termo. Originally from São Paulo and based in Canada, Serboncini had previously created games in 2012 and 2015, before beginning to release one title per year from 2018 to 2020, two in 2021, and eventually Termo in 2022. It was launched on January 5, 2022 and reached 100,000 daily players within ten days of release. The sudden growth caused the game's server to crash, leading Serboncini to migrate it to a system with four times the previous capacity. The game has also achieved popularity in Portugal.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe New York Times Games – Casual games by The New York Times\nHangman (game)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \n\"Wordles of the World\" – List of Wordle variants and language adaptations",

        "title": "Thailand",
        "content": "Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia, located on the Indochinese Peninsula. It is officially known as the Kingdom of Thailand and historically Siam until 1939. With a population of almost 66 million, it spans 513,115 square kilometres (198,115 sq mi). Thailand is bordered to the northwest by Myanmar, to the northeast and east by Laos, to the southeast by Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the southwest by the Andaman Sea; it also shares maritime borders with Vietnam to the southeast and Indonesia and India to the southwest. Bangkok is the state capital and largest city.\nThai peoples migrated from Southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 6th to 11th centuries. Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon, Khmer Empire, and Malay states ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang, Sukhothai, Lan Na, and Ayutthaya, which also rivalled each other. European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a regional power by the end of the 15th century. Ayutthaya reached its peak during the 18th century, until it was destroyed in the Burmese–Siamese War. King Taksin the Great quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom (1767–1782), of which he was the only king. He was succeeded in 1782 by Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I), the first monarch of the current Chakri dynasty. Throughout the era of Western imperialism in Asia, Siam remained the only state in the region to avoid colonisation by foreign powers, although it was often forced to make territorial, trade, and legal concessions in unequal treaties. The Siamese system of government was centralised and transformed into a modern unitary absolute monarchy during the 1868–1910 reign of Chulalongkorn (Rama V). \nIn World War I, Siam sided with the Allies, a political decision made in order to amend the unequal treaties. Following a bloodless revolution in 1932, it became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to Thailand, becoming an ally of Japan in World War II. In the late 1950s, a military coup under Sarit Thanarat revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. During the Cold War, Thailand became a major non-NATO ally of the United States and played an anti-communist role in the region as a member of SEATO, which was disbanded in 1977.\nApart from a brief period of parliamentary democracy in the mid-1970s and 1990s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. Since the 2000s, the country has been in continual political conflict between supporters and opponents of twice-elected Prime Minister of Thailand Thaksin Shinawatra, which resulted in two coups (in 2006 and 2014), along with the establishment of its current constitution, a nominally democratic government after the 2019 Thai general election, and large pro-democracy protests in 2020–2021, which included unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy. Since 2019, it has been nominally a parliamentary constitutional monarchy; in practice, however, structural advantages in the constitution have ensured the military's continued influence in politics.\nThailand is a middle power in global affairs and a founding member of ASEAN. It has the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia and the 23rd-largest in the world by PPP, and it ranks 29th by nominal GDP. Thailand is classified as a newly industrialised economy, with manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism as leading sectors.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThailand was known by outsiders before 1939 as Siam. According to George Cœdès, the word Thai (ไทย) means 'free man' in the Thai language, \"differentiating the Thai from the natives encompassed in Thai society as serfs\". According to Chit Phumisak, Thai (ไท) simply means 'people' or 'human being'; his investigation shows that some rural areas used the word \"Thai\" instead of the usual Thai word khon (คน) for people. According to Michel Ferlus, the ethnonyms Thai-Tai (or Thay-Tay) would have evolved from the etymon *k(ə)ri: 'human being'.\nThais often refer to their country using the polite form prathet Thai (Thai: ประเทศไทย). They also use the more colloquial term mueang Thai (Thai: เมืองไทย) or simply Thai; the word mueang, archaically referring to a city-state, is commonly used to refer to a city or town as the centre of a region. Ratcha Anachak Thai (Thai: ราชอาณาจักรไทย) means 'kingdom of Thailand' or 'kingdom of Thai'.\nEtymologically, its components are: ratcha (Sanskrit: राजन्, rājan, 'king, royal, realm'), ana- (Pali āṇā 'authority, command, power', itself from the Sanskrit आज्ञा, ājñā, of the same meaning), and -chak (from Sanskrit चक्र cakra- 'wheel', a symbol of power and rule).\nThe Thai National Anthem (Thai: เพลงชาติ), written by Luang Saranupraphan during the patriotic 1930s, refers to the Thai nation as prathet Thai (Thai: ประเทศไทย). The first line of the national anthem is: prathet thai ruam lueat nuea chat chuea thai (Thai: ประเทศไทยรวมเลือดเนื้อชาติเชื้อไทย), 'Thailand is founded on blood and flesh'.\nThe former name Siam may have originated from Sanskrit श्याम (śyāma, 'dark') or Mon ရာမည (rhmañña, 'stranger'), probably the same root as Shan and Assam. The word Śyâma is possibly not the true origin, but a pre-designed deviation from its proper, original meaning. Another theory is the name derives from the Chinese calling this region 'Xian'.\nThe ancient Khmers used the word Siam to refer to people settled in the west Chao Phraya River valley surrounding the ancient city of Nakhon Pathom in the present-day central Thailand; it may probably originate from the name of Lord Krishna, which also called Shyam, as in the Wat Sri Chum Inscription, dated 13th century CE, mentions Phra Maha Thera Sri Sattha came to restore Phra Pathommachedi at the city of Lord Krishna (Nakhon Pathom) in the early era of the Sukhothai Kingdom.\n\nThe signature of King Mongkut (r. 1851–1868) reads SPPM (Somdet Phra Poramenthra Maha) Mongkut Rex Siamensium (Mongkut, King of the Siamese). This usage of the name in the country's first international treaty gave the name Siam official status, until 24 June 1939 when it was changed to Thailand.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and origins ===\n\nThere is evidence of continuous human habitation in present-day Thailand from 20,000 years ago to the present day. The earliest evidence of rice growing is dated at 2,000 BCE. Areas comprising what is now Thailand participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research. The trading network existed for 3,000 years, between 2000 BCE to 1000 CE. Bronze appeared c. 1,250–1,000 BCE. The site of Ban Chiang in northeast Thailand currently ranks as the earliest known centre of copper and bronze production in Southeast Asia. Iron appeared around 500 BCE.\nThe Kingdom of Funan was the first and most powerful Southeast Asian kingdom at the time (2nd century BCE). The Mon people established the principalities of Dvaravati and Kingdom of Hariphunchai in the 6th century. The Khmer people established the Khmer empire, centred in Angkor, in the 9th century. Tambralinga, a Malay state controlling trade through the Malacca Strait, rose in the 10th century. The Indochina peninsula was heavily influenced by the culture and religions of India from the time of the Kingdom of Funan to that of the Khmer Empire.\nThe Thai people are of the Tai ethnic group, characterised by common linguistic roots. Chinese chronicles first mention the Tai peoples in the 6th century BCE. While there are many assumptions regarding the origin of Tai peoples, David K. Wyatt, a historian of Thailand, argued that their ancestors who at present inhabit Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and China came from the Điện Biên Phủ area between the 5th and the 8th century.\nThai people began migrating into present-day Thailand gradually from the 6th to 11th century, which Mon and Khmer people occupied at the time. Thus Thai culture was influenced by Indian, Mon, and Khmer cultures. Tai people intermixed with various ethnic and cultural groups in the region, resulting in many groups of present-day Thai people. Genetic evidences suggested that ethnolinguistics could not accurately predict the origins of the Thais. Sujit Wongthes argued that Thai is not a race or ethnicity but a culture group.\nAccording to French historian George Cœdès, \"The Thai first enter history of Farther India in the eleventh century with the mention of Syam slaves or prisoners of war in Champa epigraphy\", and \"in the twelfth century, the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat\" where \"a group of warriors\" are described as Syam, though Cham accounts do not indicate the origins of Syam or what ethnic group they belonged to. The origins and ethnicity of the Syam remain unclear, with some literature suggesting that Syam refers to the Shan people, the Bru people, or the Brau people. However, mainland Southeast Asian sources from before the fourteenth century primarily used the word Syam as an ethnonym, referring to those who belonged to a separate cultural category different from the Khmer, Cham, Bagan, or Mon. This contrasts with the Chinese sources, where Xian was used as a toponym.\n\n\n=== Early Tai confederate cities: (691 BCE – 13th century CE) ===\n\nTheoretically, Tai-Kadai-speaking people formed as early as the 12th century BCE in the middle of the Yangtze basin. Some groups later migrated south to Guangxi. However, after several bloody centuries against Chinese influence in Guangxi between 333 BCE and the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Tais were killed, thus, Tai people began to move southwestward along the rivers and over the lower passes into the mountain north of Southeast Asia and river valleys in present-day Assam of India. Some evidence indicates that the ancestors of Tai people migrated en masse southwestwards out of Yunnan only after the 1253 Mongol invasion of Dali; however, it is not generally accepted.\nTais defeated indigenous tribes and emerged as the new power in the new region. As a result, several Tai city-states were established, scattered from Điện Biên Phủ in present-day northwestern Vietnam and highland Southeast Asia to northeastern India.\nAccording to the Simhanavati legend given in several chronicles, the first Tai city-state in northern Thailand, Singhanavati, was founded around the 7th century. However, several modern geology and archaeology studies found that its centre, Yonok Nahaphan, dates from 691 BCE–545 CE; this roughly coincides with the establishment of Shan States, another Tai's federated principalities in the present-day northeast Myanmar. as well as Muang Sua (Luang Prabang) in the east.\nAfter Singhanavati was submerged below Chiang Saen Lake due to an earthquake in 545, the survivors then founded a new seat at Wieng–Prueksha. The kingdom lasted for another 93 years.\nIn addition to Singhanavati, another northern principality probably related to the Tai people, Ngoenyang, was established as the successor of Singhanavati in 638 by Lavachakkaraj, also centred in Wieng–Prueksha (present-day Mae Sai District, Chiang Rai). Its seat was moved to Chiang Mai in 1262 by King Mangrai, which considered the foundation of the Lan Na kingdom. Mangrai unified the surrounding area and also created a network of states through political alliances to the east and north of the Mekong. His dynasty would rule the kingdom continuously for the next two centuries. Lan Na expanded its territory southward and annexed the Mon Hariphunchai of Dvaravati in 1292.\nIn the late tenth century, Tai people began to migrate further south to the present-day upper central Thailand. Around the 1100s period, several cities in this area, such as Songkwae, Sawankhalok, and Chakangrao, were ruled by the Tai people, and they eventually launched several battles against the pre-existing Mon of Lavo, who had been falling under Chenla and Khmer influences since the 7th century, thus bringing the establishment of the Tai people's independent state, Sukhothai Kingdom, in the upper Chao Phraya River valley in 1238.\nThe earliest conflict between Tai people and the preexisting ethnics was recorded in the mid-4th century when the ruler of Singhanavati, Pangkharat, forcibly lost the seat at Yonok to King Khom from Umongasela (present-day Fang). He then fled to Vieng Si Tuang (เวียงศรีทวง; present-day Wiang Phang Kham, Mae Sai district) but had to send tributes to Yonok annually until his son, Phrom, took back Yonok and expelled King Khom from Umongasela. Phrom also marched the troops south to occupy Chakangrao from the enemy as well as founding the city of Songkwae. Some historians suggest that Lavo's capital, Lopburi, was once seized by Phrom. In contrast, Tai people instead established relationships with Siamese Mon via royal intermarriages.\n\n\n=== Mon and Lavo Kingdoms: (5th century CE – 13th century CE) ===\n\nAs is generally known, the present-day Thai people were previously called Siamese before the country was renamed Thailand in the mid-20th century. Several genetic studies published in the 21st century suggest that the so-called Siamese people (central Thai) might have had Mon origins since their genetic profiles are more closely related to the Mon people in Myanmar than the Tais of southern China, and they probably later became Tais via cultural diffusion after the arriving of Tai people from the north around the 8th–10th centuries.\nThis is also reflected in the language since over half of the vocabulary in the central Thai language is derived from or borrowed from the Mon language, as well as Pali and Sanskrit. Moreover, the Jinakalamali chronicle of Tai's Lan Na also called the southern region occupied by the Mon Haripuñjaya of Dvaravati as Shyam Pradesh (lit. 'the land of Siam people'), which indicates that the ancient Siamese and the Mon people in central Thailand were probably the same ethnolinguistic group.\nThe earliest evidence to mention the Siam people are stone inscriptions found in Angkor Borei of Funan (K.557 and K.600), dated 661 CE, the slave's name is mentioned as \"Ku Sayam\" meaning \"Sayam female slaves\" (Ku is a prefix used to refer to female slaves in the pre-Angkorian era), and the Takéo inscriptions (K.79) written in 682 during the reign of Bhavavarman II of Chenla also mention Siam Nobel: Sāraṇnoya Poña Sayam, which was transcribed into English as: the rice field that was given to the poña (noble rank) who was called Sayam (Siam).\nThe Song Huiyao Jigao (960–1279) indicate Siamese people settled in the west central Thailand and their state was called Xiān guó (Chinese: 暹國), while the eastern plain belonged to the Mon of Lavo (Chinese: 羅渦國), who later fell under the Chenla and Khmer hegemony around the 7th–9th centuries. Those Mon political entities, which also included Haripuñjaya in the north and several city-states in the northeast, are collectively called Dvaravati.\nHowever, the states of Siamese Mon and Lavo were later merged via the royal intermarriage and became Ayutthaya Kingdom in the mid-14th century, while the southwestern Isan principalities, centred in Phanom Rung and Phimai, later pledged allegiance to Siamese's Ayutthaya during the reign of Borommarachathirat II (r. 1424–1448). The remaining principal city-states in Isan region became Lan Xang around 1353 after the twin cities of Muang Sua (Luang Prabang) and Vieng Chan Vieng Kham (Vientiane) became independent following the death of the Sukhothai king Ram Khamhaeng.\nAccording to the Wat Kud Tae inscription (K.1105), dated c. 7th century, during the period that the eastern Mon entity, Lavo, was strongly influenced by the Chenla, the Siamese Mon in the west also established a royal intermarriage with Chenla as Sri Chakatham, prince of Sambhuka (ศามภูกะ, in the present-day Ratchaburi province), married to a princess of Isanavarman I, and two mandalas then became an ally. After Chenla sieged Funan and moved the centre to Angkor, both Siamese Mon and the Angkorian eventually marched the troops to attack Vijaya of Champa in 1201 during the reign of Jayavarman VII, as recorded in the Cho-Dinh inscription (C.3).\n\n\n=== Sukhothai Kingdom (1238 CE – 14th century CE) ===\n\nAfter the decline of the Khmer Empire and Kingdom of Pagan in the early 13th century, various states thrived in their place. The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day India to the north of present-day Laos and to the Malay Peninsula. During the 13th century, Tai people had already settled in the core land of Dvaravati and Lavo Kingdom to Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south. There are, however, no records detailing the arrival of the Tais.\nAround 1240, Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao, a local Tai ruler, rallied the people to rebel against the Khmer. He later crowned himself the first king of Sukhothai Kingdom in 1238. Mainstream Thai historians count Sukhothai as the first kingdom of Thai people. Sukhothai expanded furthest during the reign of Ram Khamhaeng (r. 1279–1298). However, it was mostly a network of local lords who swore fealty to Sukhothai, not directly controlled by it. He is believed have invented Thai script and Thai ceramics were an important export in his era. Sukhothai embraced Theravada Buddhism in the reign of Maha Thammaracha I (1347–1368).\n\n\n=== Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351–1767) ===\n\nAccording to the most widely accepted version of its origin, the Ayutthaya Kingdom rose from the earlier, nearby Lavo Kingdom and Suvarnabhumi with Uthong as its first king. Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the King of Ayutthaya under the mandala system. Its initial expansion was through conquest and political marriage.\nBefore the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded the Khmer Empire three times and sacked its capital Angkor. Ayutthaya then became a regional power in place of the Khmer. Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and it was finally incorporated into the kingdom. Borommatrailokkanat brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called sakdina, where male commoners were conscripted as corvée labourers for six months a year. Ayutthaya was interested in the Malay Peninsula but failed to conquer the Malacca Sultanate, which was supported by the Chinese Ming dynasty.\nEuropean contact and trade started in the early-16th century, with the envoy of Portuguese duke Afonso de Albuquerque in 1511. Portugal became an ally and ceded some soldiers to King Rama Thibodi II. The Portuguese were followed in the 17th century by the French, Dutch, and English. Rivalry for supremacy over Chiang Mai and the Mon people pitted Ayutthaya against the Burmese Kingdom. Several wars with its ruling Taungoo dynasty starting in the 1540s in the reign of Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung were ultimately ended with the capture of the capital in 1570. Then a brief period of vassalage to Burma until Naresuan proclaimed independence in 1584 followed.\nAyutthaya sought to improve relations with European powers for many successive reigns. The kingdom especially prospered during cosmopolitan Narai's reign (1656–1688), when some European travellers regarded Ayutthaya as an Asian great power, alongside China and India. However, growing French influence later in his reign was met with nationalist sentiment and eventually led to the Siamese revolution of 1688. Despite the revolution, overall relations remained stable, with French missionaries still actively preaching Christianity.\nAfter a bloody period of dynastic struggle, Ayutthaya entered what has been called the Siamese \"golden age\", a relatively peaceful episode in the second quarter of the 18th century where art, literature, and learning flourished. There were seldom foreign wars, apart from conflict with the Nguyễn lords for control of Cambodia starting around 1715. The last fifty years of the kingdom witnessed bloody succession crises, where there were purges of court officials and able generals for many consecutive reigns. In 1765, a combined 40,000-strong force of Burmese armies invaded it from the north and west. The Burmese under the new Alaungpaya dynasty quickly rose to become a new local power by 1759. After a 14-month siege, the capital city's walls fell and the city was burned in April 1767.\n\n\n=== Thonburi Kingdom (1767–1782) ===\n\nThe capital and many of its territories lay in chaos after the war. The former capital was occupied by the Burmese garrison army and five local leaders declared themselves overlords, including the lords of Sakwangburi, Phitsanulok, Pimai, Chanthaburi, and Nakhon Si Thammarat. Chao Tak, a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by right of conquest, beginning with the legendary sack of Chanthaburi. Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the Chao Phraya to take the fort of Thonburi. In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the Burmese only seven months after the fall of the city.\nChao Tak then crowned himself as Taksin and proclaimed Thonburi as temporary capital in the same year. He also quickly subdued the other warlords. His forces engaged in wars with Burma, Laos, and Cambodia, which successfully drove the Burmese out of Lan Na in 1775, captured Vientiane in 1778 and tried to install a pro-Thai king in Cambodia in the 1770s. In his final years there was a coup, supposedly caused by his \"insanity\", and eventually Taksin and his sons were executed by his longtime companion General Chao Phraya Chakri (the future Rama I). He was the first king of the ruling Chakri dynasty and founder of the Rattanakosin Kingdom on 6 April 1782.\n\n\n=== Rattanakosin Kingdom and modernization (1782 –1932) ===\n\nUnder Rama I (1782–1809), Rattanakosin successfully defended against Burmese attacks and put an end to Burmese incursions. He also created suzerainty over large portions of Laos and Cambodia. In 1821, Briton John Crawfurd was sent to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam – the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics. Bangkok signed the Burney Treaty in 1826, after the British victory in the First Anglo-Burmese War.\nAnouvong of Vientiane, who mistakenly held the belief that Britain was about to launch an invasion of Bangkok, started the Lao rebellion in 1826, which was suppressed. Vientiane was destroyed and a large number of Lao people were relocated to Khorat Plateau as a result. Bangkok also waged several wars with Vietnam, where Siam successfully regained hegemony over Cambodia.\nFrom the late 19th century, Siam tried to rule the ethnic groups in the realm as colonies. In the reign of Mongkut (1851–1868), who recognised the potential threat Western powers posed to Siam, his court contacted the British government directly to defuse tensions. A British mission led by Sir John Bowring, Governor of Hong Kong, led to the signing of the Bowring Treaty, the first of many unequal treaties with Western countries. This, however, brought trade and economic development to Siam. The unexpected death of Mongkut from malaria led to the reign of underage King Chulalongkorn, with Somdet Chaophraya Sri Suriwongse (Chuang Bunnag) acting as regent.\nChulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910) initiated centralisation, set up a privy council, and abolished slavery and the corvée system. The Front Palace crisis of 1874 stalled attempts at further reforms. In the 1870s and 1880s, he incorporated the protectorates up north into the kingdom proper, which later expanded to the protectorates in the northeast and the south. He established twelve krom in 1888, which were equivalent to present-day ministries. The crisis of 1893 erupted, caused by French demands for Laotian territory east of Mekong.\nThailand is the only Southeast Asian state never to have been colonised by a Western power, in part because Britain and France agreed in 1896 to make the Chao Phraya valley a buffer state. Not until the 20th century could Siam renegotiate every unequal treaty dating from the Bowring Treaty, including extraterritoriality. The advent of the monthon system marked the creation of the modern Thai nation-state. In 1905, there were unsuccessful rebellions in the ancient Patani area, Ubon Ratchathani, and Phrae in opposition to an attempt to blunt the power of local lords.\nThe Palace Revolt of 1912 was a failed attempt by Western-educated military officers to overthrow the Siamese monarchy. Vajiravudh (r. 1910–1925) responded by propaganda for the entirety of his reign, which promoted the idea of the Thai nation. In 1917, Siam joined the First World War on the side of the Allies. In the aftermath, Siam had a seat at the Paris Peace Conference and gained freedom of taxation and the revocation of extraterritoriality.\n\n\n=== Military Dictatorship Era (1932–1975) ===\n\nA period of wasteful spending by King Vajiravudh followed by the Great Depression brought economic hardships on Thailand, with sharply falling rice prices, a significant reduction in public spending, eroded confidence in the monarchy, and discontent among aristocratic supporters all contributing to the destabilization of the Chakri dynasty. These conditions spurred on the bloodless Siamese revolution of 1932, in which the Khana Ratsadon movement forced King Prajadhipok to sign the country's first constitution, thereby ending centuries of feudal and absolute monarchy. Power was partially ceded to a democratic government, but it would not last a year before the rise of significant military influence in Thai political affairs.\nIn 1933, Prime Minister Phraya Mano led a counter-revolutionary rebellion to reinstate an absolute monarchy under Prajadhipok. This was soon followed by a military coup that installed Phraya Phahon - a leader of the 1932 revolution - as Prime Minister. Prajadhipok's conflict with the government eventually led to his abdication, and the new military-led government selected Switzerland-raised Ananda Mahidol to be the new king.\nThe armed wing of Khana Ratsadon gradually came to dominate Siamese politics. Military strongman Plaek Phibunsongkhram, often known as \"Phibun\", became premier in 1938 and launched a campaign of political repression that saw the execution of both Monarchists and pro-democracy Liberals. His government adopted Thai nationalist, pro-Westernisation, anti-royalist, Irredentist, anti-Chinese and anti-French policies.\nIn 1939, Phibun changed the country's name from \"Siam\" to \"Thailand\". This coincided with the rise of fascist ideology in Thailand, with the name change reflecting policies that prioritized the needs of ethnic Thais over those of minorities like the Thai Chinese. Phibun was an admirer of Benito Mussolini, and he imposed twelve Thai cultural mandates requiring citizens to obey nationalist norms such as saluting the flag, knowing the national anthem, speaking only Thai, and wearing Western clothing.\nIn October 1940, months after fall of France to Nazi Germany, Phibun launched an opportunistic invasion of French Indochinese territories lost to the French Empire during the reign of King Chulalongkorn. The invasion was a success, with Thailand additionally gaining some Lao and Cambodian territories.Japan, which had also been invading French Indochinese territories, brokered a ceasefire that forced France to give up several territories to Thailand.\nOn 8 December 1941, the Japanese Empire launched an invasion of Thailand, and fierce fighting broke out in Southern Thailand before Phibun ordered an armistice and joined the Axis powers just five hours later. Japan was granted free passage through Thai territory, and on 21 December Thailand and Japan signed a military alliance, with a secret protocol wherein the Japanese government agreed to help Thailand gain further territories throughout southeast Asia.\nThe Thai government then declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom, whose colony Malaya was under immediate threat from Thai forces, responded in kind, but the United States refused to declare war and ignored Thailand's declaration. The Free Thai Movement was launched both in Thailand and abroad to oppose the Thai government and Japanese occupation. After the war ended in 1945, Phibun was ousted and Thailand signed formal agreements to end the state of war with the Allies. In June 1946, King Ananda was found dead under mysterious circumstances, and his younger brother Bhumibol Adulyadej ascended to the throne.\n\nThis period of Liberal rule was brief, with Phibun launching another military coup to take power in 1947. In his second term as Prime Minister, Phibun pursued an alliance with the United States by undertaking a campaign of domestic anti-communism, aiding the US invasion of Korea, and helping to establish the US-aligned Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1954. Following a tour of Europe and the US in 1955 where he was impressed by democratic practices like freedom of speech, Phibun began to democratize Thai politics by allowing new political parties and trade unions to form, opening public forums, granting amnesty to former political opponents, and preparing Thailand for its first free elections. However, these practices likely aroused opposition to Phibun's dictatorial legacy, and the US supported his final ouster in 1957.\nField Marshal Sarit Thanarat took power by coup in 1957, and he proceeded to reverse Phibun's democratic reforms and ban the Khana Ratsadon party from politics. His rule from 1959–1963 was autocratic; he built his legitimacy around the god-like status of the monarch and by channelling the government and public's loyalty to the king. Though Phibun had been criticized for his close relationship to the United States, Sarit also aligned himself with them and militarily supported the United States invasion of Vietnam in 1961, leading a simultaneous campaign of anti-communist mass killings in Thailand that continued under his successor Thanom Kittikachorn.\nThe Sarit and Thanom periods coincided with significant modernisation and Westernisation of Thai society. Rapid urbanisation occurred as the rural populace sought work in growing cities like Bangkok. Economic development and education enabled the rise of an urban middle class. The growth of this economy based on wage labour rather than subsistence agriculture resulted in increased class consciousness and sympathies to the Communist Party of Thailand, while university-educated students formed movements against the military dictatorship. In October 1973, a popular uprising against the Thanom government began to bring about an end to Thailand's military regime. In response to mass killings of protesters, King Adulyadej installed Sanya Dharmasakti as Prime Minister, marking the first time that the king had intervened in Thai politics directly since 1932. The aftermath of the event marked a short-lived parliamentary democracy, often called the \"era when democracy blossomed\" (ยุคประชาธิปไตยเบ่งบาน).\n\n\n=== Transition to Democracy ===\n\nA post-uprising period of unrest and instability, as well as fear of a communist takeover after the fall of Saigon in 1975, culminated in the Thammasat University massacre in October 1976. A coup d'état on that day brought Thailand a new ultra-right government, which cracked down on media outlets, officials, and intellectuals, and engendered a communist insurgency. Another coup the following year installed a more moderate government, which offered amnesty to some communist fighters in 1978.\nRiding on a wave of right-wing sentiments fueled by the Indochina refugee crisis, Vietnamese border raids, and economic hardship, military strongman Prem Tinsulanonda was appointed Prime Minister from in 1980. Following negotiations with Prem, the communists abandoned the insurgency by 1983. Prem's premiership was dubbed \"semi-democracy\" because the Parliament was composed of all elected House and all appointed Senate. The 1980s also saw increasing intervention in politics by the monarch, who foiled two coups in attempts against Prem in 1981 and 1985. In 1988, Thailand saw its first freely elected prime minister since 1976. Chatichai Choonhavan ruled for 3 years before being overthrown in a coup that ushered in two years of military rule under the National Peace Keeping Council.\nOne of the coup leaders, Suchinda Kraprayoon, was nominated as prime minister the majority coalition government after the 1992 general election. This caused a popular demonstration in Bangkok, which ended with a bloody military crackdown. The king intervened in the event, granting amnesty to the belligerents and forcing the resignation of Suchinda.\nThe 1997 Asian financial crisis originated in Thailand and ended the country's 40 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's government took an IMF loan to support the recovery.\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami hit the country, mostly in the south, claiming around 5,400 lives in Phuket, Phang Nga, Ranong, Krabi, Trang, and Satun, with thousands still missing.\nThe populist Thai Rak Thai party, led by prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, governed from 2001 until 2006. His policies were successful in reducing rural poverty and providing universal healthcare. However, Thaksin was viewed as a corrupt populist who was destroying the middle class in order to favour himself and the rural poor. He also faced criticism over his response to the South Thailand insurgency which escalated starting from 2004. Additionally, his recommendations to the rural poor directly conflicted with King Bhumibol's recommendations, drawing the ire of royalists, a powerful faction in Thailand. In response, the royalists made up a story about how Thaksin and his \"advisors gathered in Finland to plot the overthrow of the monarchy\".\nMeanwhile, massive protests against Thaksin led by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) started in his second term as prime minister. Eventually, the monarchy and the military agree to oust the leader. In this case, the military first sought permission from the king to oust Thaksin, the permission was denied. But then, the king rejected Thaksin's choice to lead the army, allowing a military leader to be put into power who wanted the coup.1 Then, the army dissolved Thaksin's party with a coup d'état in 2006 and banned over a hundred of its executives from politics. After the coup, a military government was installed which lasted a year.\n\nComing back to democracy was a process that took very active participation of the people. The people frequently stormed government buildings and the military threatened yet another coup. Finally, in 2007, a civilian government led by the Thaksin-allied People's Power Party (PPP) was elected. Another protest led by PAD ended with the dissolution of PPP, and the Democrat Party led a coalition government in its place. The pro-Thaksin United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) protested both in 2009 and in 2010, the latter of which ended with a violent military crackdown causing more than 70 civilian deaths.\nAfter the general election of 2011, the populist Pheu Thai Party won a majority. Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin's younger sister, became prime minister. The People's Democratic Reform Committee organised another anti-Shinawatra protest after the ruling party proposed an amnesty bill which would benefit Thaksin. Yingluck dissolved parliament and a general election was scheduled, but was invalidated by the Constitutional Court. The crisis ended with another coup d'état in 2014.\nThe ensuing National Council for Peace and Order, a military junta led by General Prayut Chan-o-cha, led the country until 2019. Civil and political rights were restricted, and the country saw a surge in lèse-majesté cases. Political opponents and dissenters were sent to \"attitude adjustment\" camps; this was described by academics as showing the rise of fascism. Bhumibol, the longest-reigning Thai king, died in 2016, and his son Vajiralongkorn ascended to the throne. The referendum and adoption of Thailand's current constitution happened under the junta's rule. The junta also bound future governments to a 20-year national strategy 'road map' it laid down, effectively locking the country into military-guided democracy.\nIn 2019, the junta agreed to schedule a general election in March. Prayut continued his premiership with the support of Palang Pracharath Party-coalition in the House and junta-appointed Senate, amid allegations of election fraud. The 2020–21 pro-democracy protests were triggered by increasing royal prerogative, democratic and economic regression from the Royal Thai Armed Forces supported by the monarchy in the wake of the coup d'état in 2014, dissolution of the pro-democracy Future Forward Party, distrust in the 2019 general election and the current political system, forced disappearance and deaths of political activists including Wanchalearm Satsaksit, and political corruption scandals, which brought forward unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy and the highest sense of republicanism in the country.\nIn May 2023, Thailand's reformist opposition, the progressive Move Forward Party (MFP) and the populist Pheu Thai Party, won the general election, meaning the royalist-military parties that supported Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha lost power. On 22 August 2023, Srettha Thavisin of the populist Pheu Thai party, became Thailand's new prime minister, while the Pheu Thai party's billionaire figurehead Thaksin Shinawatra returned to Thailand after years in self-imposed exile. Thavisin was later dismissed from his prime ministerial role on 14 August 2024 by the Constitutional Court for his \"gross ethics violations\".\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTotalling 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), Thailand is the 50th-largest country by total area. Thailand comprises several distinct geographic regions, partly corresponding to the provincial groups. The north of the country is the mountainous area of the Thai highlands, with the highest point being Doi Inthanon in the Thanon Thong Chai Range at 2,565 metres (8,415 ft) above sea level. The northeast, Isan, consists of the Khorat Plateau, bordered to the east by the Mekong River. The centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat Chao Phraya river valley, which runs into the Gulf of Thailand. Southern Thailand consists of the narrow Kra Isthmus that widens into the Malay Peninsula.\nThe Chao Phraya and the Mekong River are the indispensable water courses of rural Thailand. Industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries. The Gulf of Thailand covers 320,000 square kilometres (124,000 sq mi) and is fed by the Chao Phraya, Mae Klong, Bang Pakong, and Tapi Rivers. It contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the Kra Isthmus. The eastern shore of the Gulf of Thailand has the kingdom's premier deepwater port in Sattahip and its busiest commercial port, Laem Chabang. Phuket, Krabi, Ranong, Phang Nga and Trang, and their islands, all lay along the coasts of the Andaman Sea.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character (the southwest and northeast monsoon). Most of the country is classified as Köppen's tropical savanna climate. The majority of the south, as well as the eastern tip, have a tropical monsoon climate. Parts of the south also have a tropical rainforest climate.\nA year in Thailand is divided into three seasons. The first is the rainy or southwest monsoon season (mid–May to mid–October), which is caused by southwestern wind from the Indian Ocean.\nRainfall is also contributed by Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and tropical cyclones, with August and September being the wettest period of the year. The country receives a mean annual rainfall of 1,200 to 1,600 mm (47 to 63 in).\nWinter or the northeast monsoon occurs from mid-October until mid-February. Most of Thailand experiences dry weather with mild temperatures. Summer or the pre-monsoon season runs from mid-February until mid-May.\nDue to their inland position and latitude, the north, northeast, central and eastern parts of Thailand experience a long period of warm weather, where temperatures can reach up to 40 °C (104 °F) during March to May, in contrast to close to or below 0 °C (32 °F) in some areas in winter.\nSouthern Thailand is characterised by mild weather year-round with less diurnal and seasonal variations in temperatures due to maritime influences. It receives abundant rainfall, particularly during October to November. Thailand is among the world's ten countries that are most exposed to climate change. In particular, it is highly vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather events.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity and conservation ===\n\nNational parks in Thailand are defined as an area that contains natural resources of ecological importance or unique beauty, or flora and fauna of special importance. Thailand's protected areas include 156 national parks, 58 wildlife sanctuaries, 67 non-hunting areas, and 120 forest parks. They cover almost 31 per cent of the kingdom's territory. The parks are administered by the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department (DNP) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE).\nThailand has a mediocre but improving performance in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI), with an overall ranking of 91 out of 180 countries in 2016. The environmental areas where Thailand performs worst (i.e., highest-ranking) are air quality (167), environmental effects of the agricultural industry (106), and the climate and energy sector (93), the later mainly because of a high CO2 emission per kWh produced. Thailand performs best (i.e., lowest-ranking) in water resource management (66), with some major improvements expected for the future, and sanitation (68). The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.00/10, ranking it 88th globally out of 172 countries.\nThe population of elephants, the country's national symbol, has fallen from 100,000 in 1850 to an estimated 2,000. Poachers have long hunted elephants for ivory and hides, and now increasingly for meat. Young elephants are often captured for use in tourist attractions or as work animals, where there have been claims of mistreatment. In 1989, the government banned the use of elephants for logging, leading many elephant owners to move their domesticated animals to the tourism industry.\nPoaching of protected species remains a major problem. Tigers, leopards, and other large cats are hunted for their pelts. Many are farmed or hunted for their meat, which supposedly has medicinal properties. Although such trade is illegal, the well-known Bangkok market Chatuchak is still known for the sale of endangered species. The practice of keeping wild animals as pets affects species such as Asiatic black bear, Malayan sun bear, white-handed lar, pileated gibbon, and binturong.\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\nPrior to 1932, Thai kings were feudal or absolute monarchs. During Sukhothai Kingdom, the king was seen as a Dharmaraja or 'king who rules in accordance with Dharma'. The system of government was a network of tributaries ruled by local lords. Modern absolute monarchy and statehood was established by Chulalongkorn when he transformed the decentralised protectorate system into a unitary state. On 24 June 1932, Khana Ratsadon (People's Party) carried out a bloodless revolution which marked the beginning of constitutional monarchy.\nThailand has had 20 constitutions and charters since 1932, including the latest and current 2017 Constitution. All constitutions state that the politics is conducted within the framework of a constitutional monarchy, but the de facto form of government has ranged from military dictatorship to electoral democracy. Thailand's current form of government is part democracy and part dictatorship; many terms are used to describe it. Thailand has had the fourth-most coups in the world. \"Uniformed or ex-military men have led Thailand for 55 of the 83 years\" between 1932 and 2009. Most recently, the military junta self-titled as the National Council for Peace and Order ruled the country between 2014 and 2019.\n\nGovernment is separated into three branches:\n\nThe legislative branch: the National Assembly is composed of the Senate, the 200-member indirectly elected upper house and House of Representatives, the elected 500-member lower house. Its most recent election is the 2023 general election. The coalition led by Pheu Thai Party currently holds the majority. The 2024 Thai Senate election was the first senate election held under the current constitution in the process criticized as \"the most complicated election in the world\". The senate is allegedly dominated by Bhumjaithai Party-affiliated senators.\nThe executive branch consisting of the Prime Minister of Thailand, the head of government, and other cabinet members of up to 35 people. The Prime Minister was elected by the House of Representatives. The current constitution mandates that prime ministers are to be considered from candidates nominated by political parties before the election. The current prime minister is Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a member of the Pheu Thai Party.\nThe judiciary is supposed to be independent of the executive and the legislative branches, although judicial rulings are suspected of being based on political considerations rather than on existing law.\nMilitary and bureaucratic aristocrats fully controlled political parties between 1946 and the 1980s. Most parties in Thailand are short-lived. Between 1992 and 2006, Thailand had a two-party system. Later constitutions created a multi-party system where a single party cannot gain a majority in the house.\nA hereditary monarch serves as Thailand's head of state. The current King of Thailand is Vajiralongkorn (Rama X), who has reigned since October 2016. The powers of the king are limited by the constitution and he is primarily a symbolic figurehead. However, the monarch still occasionally intervenes in Thai politics, as all constitutions pave the way for customary royal rulings. Some academics outside Thailand, including Duncan McCargo and Federico Ferrara, noted extraconstitutional role of the monarch through a \"network monarchy\" behind the political scenes. The monarchy is protected by the severe lèse majesté law, even though the people's attitude towards the institution varies from one reign to another.\nThe kings are protected by lèse-majesté laws which allow critics to be jailed for three to fifteen years. After the coup d'état in 2014, Thailand had the highest number of lèse-majesté prisoners in the nation's history. Human rights in Thailand has been rated not free on the Freedom House Index since 2014. On August 7, 2024, Thailand's Constitutional Court banned the victors of the 2023 parliamentary elections, the Move Forward Party and all of its leaders from politics for its proposal to reform the lèse-majesté law, arguing it posed a threat to the constitutional order. The Economist criticised the move as an example of \"lawfare\" and pointed to the dissolution of its predecessor party, Future Forward in 2020, as the latest example of how an \"alliance of conservative forces in Thailand—including monarchists, the army and a handful of business tycoons—has sought to suppress opposition\".\nOn the Freedom in the World 2024 Report for Thailand, their status improved from not free to partly free due to competitive parliamentary elections and the formation of a new governing coalition by what had been a major opposition party, though unelected senators ensured that the party with the most votes was excluded.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThailand is a unitary state; the administrative services of the executive branch are divided into three levels by National Government Organisation Act, BE 2534 (1991): central, provincial and local. Thailand is composed of 76 provinces (จังหวัด, changwat), which are first-level administrative divisions. There are also two specially governed districts: the capital Bangkok and Pattaya. Bangkok is at provincial level and thus often counted as a province. Each province is divided into districts (อำเภอ, amphoe) and the districts are further divided into sub-districts (ตำบล, tambons). The name of each province's capital city (เมือง, mueang) is the same as that of the province. For example, the capital of Chiang Mai Province (Changwat Chiang Mai) is Mueang Chiang Mai or Chiang Mai. All provincial governors and district chiefs, which are administrators of provinces and districts respectively, are appointed by the central government. Thailand's provinces are sometimes grouped into four to six regions, depending on the source.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nSiam's and Thailand's way of conducting foreign relations has long been described as \"bamboo bending with the wind\", of policies that are \"always solidly rooted, but flexible enough to bend whichever way the wind blows in order to survive\", or adaptable and pragmatic. In order to secure independence, it sought to pit one great power against the others so that it would be dominated by none.\nDuring the Cold War, Thailand sought to prevent the spread of communism so it joined the United States, including participating in SEATO alliance, sending expeditions to Korea and Vietnam, and offering the US to use its base. Thailand is one of the five founding members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), initially to safeguard against communism. The end of Vietnam War was a turning point in Thai foreign policy and afterwards it sought to improve relations with Communist China and its now-Communist neighbours. Thailand remains an active member of ASEAN and seek to project its influence in it. Thailand has developed increasingly close ties with other members, with progressing regional co-operation in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters.\nIn the 2000s, Thailand had taken an active role on the international stage and participated fully in international and regional organisations. It is a major non-NATO ally and Priority Watch List Special 301 Report of the United States. When East Timor gained independence from Indonesia, Thailand contributed troops to the international peacekeeping effort. As part of its effort to increase international ties, Thailand had reached out to such regional organisations as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\nDuring Thaksin Shinawatra's premiership, negotiations for several free trade agreements with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US were initiated. Thaksin sought to position Thailand as a regional leader, initiating various development projects in poorer neighbouring countries. More controversially, he established close, friendly ties with the Burmese dictatorship. Thailand joined the US-led invasion of Iraq, sending a humanitarian contingent until September 2004. Thailand also had contributed troops to reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.\nIn April 2009, the 2008–2013 Cambodian–Thai border crisis brought troops on territory immediately adjacent to the 900-year-old ruins of Cambodia's Preah Vihear Hindu temple near the border.\nAfter the 2014 coup, Thailand leaned more towards China. Growing Chinese influence and capital inflow caused some members of parliament to raise the concern about \"economic colony\" under China after many concessions.\nDuring the Israel-Gaza war in 2023, at first Thailand's prime minister stated that his government strongly condemns the attack against Israel and extends its deepest condolences to the government and the people of Israel but the government later changed its position and announced that Thailand adopted a neutral stance in this conflict. 28 Thai nationals were killed in this conflict.\n\n\n=== Armed forces ===\n\nThe Royal Thai Armed Forces (กองทัพไทย; RTGS: Kong Thap Thai) constitute the military of the Kingdom of Thailand. It consists of the Royal Thai Army (กองทัพบกไทย), the Royal Thai Navy (กองทัพเรือไทย), and the Royal Thai Air Force (กองทัพอากาศไทย). It also incorporates various paramilitary forces.\nThe Thai Armed Forces have a combined manpower of 306,000 active duty personnel and another 245,000 active reserve personnel. The head of the Thai Armed Forces (จอมทัพไทย, Chom Thap Thai) is the king, although this position is only nominal. The armed forces are managed by the Ministry of Defence of Thailand, which is headed by the Minister of Defence (a member of the cabinet of Thailand) and commanded by the Royal Thai Armed Forces Headquarters, which in turn is headed by the Chief of Defence Forces of Thailand. Thai annual defence budget almost tripled from US$1.98 billion in 2005 to US$5.88 billion in 2016, accounting for approximately 1.4% of GDP. Thailand ranked 16th worldwide in the Military Strength Index based on the Credit Suisse report in September 2015.\n\nThe military is also tasked with humanitarian missions, such as escorting Rohingya to Malaysia or Indonesia, ensuring security and welfare for refugees during Indochina refugee crisis.\nAccording to the constitution, serving in the armed forces is a duty of all Thai citizens. Thailand still use active draft system for males over the age of 21. They are subjected to varying lengths of active service depending on the duration of reserve training as Territorial Defence Student and their level of education. Those who have completed three years or more of reserve training will be exempted entirely. The practice has long been criticized, as some media question its efficacy and value. It is alleged that conscripts end up as servants to senior officers or clerks in military cooperative shops. In a report issued in March 2020, Amnesty International charged that Thai military conscripts face institutionalised abuse systematically hushed up by military authorities.\nCritics observed that Thai military's main objective is to deal with internal rather than external threats. Internal Security Operations Command is called the political arm of the Thai military, which has overlapping social and political functions with civilian bureaucracy. It also has anti-democracy mission. The military is also notorious for numerous corruption incidents, such as accusation of human trafficking, and nepotism in promotion of high-ranking officers. The military is deeply entrenched in politics. Most recently, the appointed senators include more than 100 active and retired military.\nThailand is the 75th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP). Thailand exports over US$105 billion worth of goods and services annually. Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, rice, textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery.\nThailand is an emerging economy and is considered a newly industrialised country. Thailand had a 2017 GDP of US$1.236 trillion (on a purchasing power parity basis). Thailand is the second largest economy in Southeast Asia after Indonesia. Thailand ranks midway in the wealth spread in Southeast Asia as it is the fourth richest nation according to GDP per capita, after Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia.\nThailand functions as an anchor economy for the neighbouring developing economies of Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia. In the third quarter of 2014, the unemployment rate in Thailand stood at 0.84% according to Thailand's National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB).\nIn 2017, the Thai economy grew an inflation-adjusted 3.9%, up from 3.3% in 2016, marking its fastest expansion since 2012. High public spending, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, prompted the authorities to raise Thailand's public debt ceiling from 60% to 70% of GDP.\nAs of 2024, Thailand struggles with low productivity, poor education, high household debt, low private investment and slow economic growth, with an economic research group forecasted an annual GDP growth of below 2% in the next decades without structural reforms.\n\n\n=== Income and wealth disparities ===\n\nThais have median wealth per one adult person of $1,469 in 2016, increasing from $605 in 2010. In 2016, Thailand was ranked 87th in Human Development Index, and 70th in the inequality-adjusted HDI.\nIn 2017, Thailand's median household income was ฿26,946 per month. Top quintile households had a 45.0% share of all income, while bottom quintile households had 7.1%. There were 26.9 million persons who had the bottom 40% of income earning less than ฿5,344 per person per month. During the 2013–2014 Thai political crisis, a survey found that anti-government PDRC mostly (32%) had a monthly income of more than ฿50,000, while pro-government UDD mostly (27%) had between ฿10,000 and ฿20,000.\nIn 2014, Credit Suisse reported that Thailand was the world's third most unequal country, behind Russia and India. The top 10% richest held 79% of the country's assets. The top 1% held 58% of the assets. The 50 richest Thai families had a total net worth accounting to 30% of GDP. Bank of Thailand reported that during 2006–16, Thailand's top 5% largest companies had 85% of all corporate revenue in the nation, and only 6% of the country's companies were in export industries, which made up 60% of the country's GDP.\nIn 2016, 5.81 million people lived in poverty, or 11.6 million people (17.2% of population) if \"near poor\" is included. The proportion of the poor relative to total population in each region was 12.96% in the Northeast, 12.35% in the South, and 9.83% in the North. In 2017, there were 14 million people who applied for social welfare (yearly income of less than ฿100,000 was required). In the first quarter of 2023, Thai household debts totaled 14.6 trillion baht or 89.2% of GDP; the average debt per household was approximately 500,000 baht. In 2016, there were estimated 30,000 homeless persons in the country.\n\n\n=== Exports and manufacturing ===\nThe economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic products (GDPs). Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, rice, textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery. In 2022, Thailand's export of goods is worth roughly US$290 billion while its import worth roughly US$305 billion.\nSubstantial industries include electric appliances, components, computer components, and vehicles. Thailand's recovery from the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis depended mainly on exports, among various other factors. As of 2012, the Thai automotive industry was the largest in Southeast Asia and the 9th largest in the world. The Thailand industry has an annual output of near 1.5 million vehicles, mostly commercial vehicles.\nMost of the vehicles built in Thailand are developed and licensed by foreign producers, mainly Japanese and American. The Thai car industry takes advantage of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) to find a market for many of its products. Eight manufacturers, five Japanese, two US, and Tata of India, produce pick-up trucks in Thailand. As of 2012, due to its favourable taxation for 2-door pick-ups at only 3–12% against 17–50% for passenger cars, Thailand was the second largest consumer of pick-up trucks in the world, after the US. In 2014, pick-ups accounted for 42% of all new vehicle sales in Thailand.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism makes up about 6% of the country's economy. Prior to the pandemic, Thailand was the world's eighth most visited country according to the World Tourism rankings compiled by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation. In 2019, Thailand received 39.8 million international tourists, ahead of United Kingdom and Germany and was the fourth highest in international tourism earning 60.5 billion US dollars.\nThailand was the most visited country in Southeast Asia in 2013, according to the World Tourism Organisation. Estimates of tourism receipts directly contributing to the Thai GDP of 12 trillion baht range from 9 per cent (1 trillion baht) (2013) to 16 per cent. When including the indirect effects of tourism, it is said to account for 20.2 per cent (2.4 trillion baht) of Thailand's GDP.\nAsian tourists primarily visit Thailand for Bangkok and the historical, natural, and cultural sights in its vicinity. Western tourists not only visit Bangkok and surrounding areas; many travel to the southern beaches and islands. The north is the chief destination for trekking and adventure travel with its diverse ethnic minority groups and forested mountains. The region hosting the fewest tourists is Isan. To accommodate foreign visitors, a separate tourism police with offices were set up in the major tourist areas and an emergency telephone number.\nThailand ranks as the worlds fifth largest medical tourism destination in spending, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, attracting over 2.5 million visitors in 2018, and is number one in Asia. The country is popular for the growing practice of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and cosmetic surgery. In 2010–2012, more than 90% of medical tourists travelled to Thailand for SRS. Prostitution in Thailand and sex tourism also form a de facto part of the economy. Campaigns promote Thailand as exotic to attract tourists. One estimate published in 2003 placed the trade at US$4.3 billion per year or about 3% of the Thai economy. It is believed that at least 10% of tourist dollars are spent on the sex trade.\n\n\n=== Agriculture and natural resources ===\n\nForty-nine per cent of Thailand's labour force is employed in agriculture. This is down from 70% in 1980. Rice is the most important crop in the country and Thailand had long been the world's leading exporter of rice, until recently falling behind both India and Vietnam. Thailand has the highest percentage of arable land, 27.25%, of any state in the Greater Mekong Subregion. About 55% of the arable land area is used for rice production.\nAgriculture has been experiencing a transition from labour-intensive and transitional methods to a more industrialised and competitive sector. Between 1962 and 1983, the agricultural sector grew by 4.1% per year on average and continued to grow at 2.2% between 1983 and 2007. The relative contribution of agriculture to GDP has declined while exports of goods and services have increased.\nFurthermore, access to biocapacity in Thailand is lower than world average. In 2016, Thailand had 1.2 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, a little less than world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In contrast, in 2016, they used 2.5 global hectares of biocapacity—their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use about twice as much biocapacity as Thailand contains, resulting in a deficit.\n\n\n=== Informal economy ===\n\nIn 2012, it was estimated that informal workers comprised 62.6% of the Thai workforce. The Ministry of Labour defines informal workers to be individuals who work in informal economies and do not have employee status under a given country's Labour Protection Act (LPA). The informal sector in Thailand has grown significantly over the past 60 years over the course of Thailand's gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialised and service-oriented. Between 1993 and 1995, ten per cent of the Thai labour force moved from the agricultural sector to urban and industrial jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector. It is estimated that between 1988 and 1995, the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million, as Thailand's GDP tripled.\n\nWhile the Asian financial crisis that followed in 1997 hit the Thai economy hard, the industrial sector continued to expand under widespread deregulation, as Thailand was mandated to adopt a range of structural adjustment reforms upon receiving funding from the IMF and World Bank. These reforms implemented an agenda of increased privatisation and trade liberalisation in the country, and decreased federal subsidisation of public goods and utilities, agricultural price supports, and regulations on fair wages and labour conditions. Many migrant farmers took jobs in sweatshops and factories with few labour regulations and often exploitative conditions. Those that could not find formal factory work, including illegal migrants and the families of rural Thai migrants, are under the regulation imposed by the structural adjustment programmes. Scholars argue that the economic consequences and social costs of Thailand's labour reforms in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis fell on individuals and families rather than the state. \nInformal labour in entertainment, nightlife, and the sex industry face additional vulnerabilities, including recruitment into circles of sexual exploitation and human trafficking. A 2012 study found that 64% of informal workers had not completed education beyond primary school. Many informal workers are also migrants, only some of which have legal status in the country. The informal labour sector is also not recognised under the Labour Protection Act (LPA). Thai social security policies fail to protect against workplace accidents and unemployment and retirement insurance. Many informal workers are not legally contracted for their employment, and many do not make a living wage. Tens of thousands of migrants from neighboring countries face exploitation in a few industries, especially in fishing where slave-like conditions have been reported.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\nThailand ranked 41st in the Global Innovation Index in 2024. The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation and its agencies oversees the development of science, technology, and research in Thailand. According to the National Research Council of Thailand, the country devoted 1.1% of its GDP to the research and development of science in 2019, with over 166,788 research and development personnel in full-time equivalent that year.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe State Railway of Thailand (SRT) operates all of Thailand's national rail lines. Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal and Bangkok (Hua Lamphong) are the main termini of intercity routes. Phahonyothin and ICD Lat Krabang are the main freight terminals. As of 2025 SRT had 4,507 km (2,801 mi) of track, all of it meter gauge. Nearly all is single-track (2702.1 km), although some important sections around Bangkok are double (1,234.9 km or 767.3 mi) or triple-tracked (107 km or 66 mi), and there are plans to extend this.\nRail transport in Bangkok includes long-distance services. There are four rapid transit rail systems in the capital: the BTS Skytrain, MRT, SRT Red Lines, and the Airport Rail Link. In Bangkok, there were two failed rapid rail projects Lavalin Skytrain and Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System, before Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region was endorsed by the cabinet on 27 September 1994 and implemented from 1995 to the present.\nThailand has 390,000 kilometres (240,000 miles) of highways. As of 2017, Thailand has over 462,133 roads and 37 million registered vehicles, 20 million of them motorbikes. A number of undivided two-lane highways have been converted into divided four-lane highways. Within the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, there are a number of controlled-access highways. There are 4,125 public vans operating on 114 routes from Bangkok alone. Other forms of road transport includes tuk-tuks, taxis—with over 80,647 registered taxis nationwide as of 2018, vans (minibus), motorbike taxis, and songthaews.\nAs of 2012, Thailand has 103 airports with 63 paved runways, in addition to 6 heliports. The busiest airport in the country is Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\n75% of Thailand's electrical generation is powered by natural gas in 2014. Coal-fired power plants produce an additional 20% of electricity, with the remainder coming from biomass, hydro, and biogas. Compared to other ASEAN's countries, Thailand is the largest importer of gas in weight. In 2022, Thailand's oil and gas production dropped by 19% and 17%, respectively.\nThe government, in 2018, has developed an Alternative Energy Development Plan 2018–2037 (AEDP 2018). The plan defines goals for the increase of renewable energy to almost 30,000 MW by 2037.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThailand has an estimated population of 65.97 million in 2024. Thailand's first census in 1909 found the population to be 8.2 million. Thailand's population is largely rural, concentrated in the rice-growing areas of the central, northeastern, and northern regions. About 44.2% of Thailand's population lived in urban areas as of 2010, slowly increasing from 29.4% in the 1990 census and 31.1% in the 2000 census.\nThailand's government-sponsored family planning programme resulted in a dramatic decline in population growth from 3.1% in 1960 to around 0.4% today. In 1970, an average of 5.7 people lived in a Thai household; in 2022, the average Thai household size was 3 people. Now, more than 20% of its population is aged over 60 and has a low birth rate, posing economic challenges. The sex ratio between male and female is 1.05, with Thailand having slightly more males. Thailand's total fertility rate declined to 1.0 in 2024. This ranks Thailand among countries with ultra-low fertility rates.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nAs of 2010, Thai people make up the majority of Thailand's population (95.9%). The remaining 4.1% of the population are Burmese (2.0%), others (1.3%), and unspecified (0.9%).\nAccording to genetic research, the present-day Thai people were divided into three groups: the northern group (Khon Mueang) are closely related to the Tai ethnic groups in southern China, the northeastern group (Isan people) are mixed Tai and several Austroasiatic-speaking ethnic groups, while the central and southern groups (formerly called Siamese) strongly share genetic profiles with the Mon people.\nAccording to the Royal Thai Government's 2011 Country Report to the UN Committee responsible for the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, available from the Department of Rights and Liberties Promotion of the Thai Ministry of Justice, 62 ethnic communities are officially recognised in Thailand. Twenty million Central Thai (together with approximately 650,000 Khorat Thai) made up approximately 20,650,000 (34.1 per cent) of the state's population of 60,544,937 at the time of completion of the Mahidol University Ethnolinguistic Maps of Thailand data (1997).\nThe 2011 Thailand Country Report provides population numbers for mountain peoples ('hill tribes') and ethnic communities in the Northeast and is explicit about its main reliance on the Mahidol University Ethnolinguistic Maps of Thailand data. Thus, though over 3.288 million people in the Northeast alone could not be categorised, the population and percentages of other ethnic communities c. 1997 are known for all of Thailand and constitute minimum populations. In descending order, the largest (equal to or greater than 400,000) are a) 15,080,000 Lao (24.9 per cent) consisting of the Thai Lao (14 million) and other smaller Lao groups, namely the Thai Loei (400–500,000), Lao Lom (350,000), Lao Wiang/Klang (200,000), Lao Khrang (90,000), Lao Ngaew (30,000), and Lao Ti (10,000); b) six million Khon Muang (9.9 per cent, also called Northern Thais); c) 4.5 million Pak Tai (7.5 per cent, also called Southern Thais); d) 1.4 million Khmer Leu (2.3 per cent, also called Northern Khmer); e) 900,000 Malay (1.5%); f) 500,000 Nyaw (0.8 per cent); g) 470,000 Phu Thai (0.8 per cent); h) 400,000 Kuy/Kuay (also known as Suay) (0.7 per cent), and i) 350,000 Karen (0.6 per cent). Thai Chinese, including those of significant Chinese origins, are 14% of the population, while Thais with partial Chinese ancestry comprise up to 40% of the population. Thai Malays also represent 3% of the Thai population's heritage, with the remainder consisting of Mons, Khmers, and various \"hill tribes\".\nIncreasing numbers of migrants from neighbouring Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia, as well as from Nepal and India, have pushed the total number of non-national residents to around 3.5 million as of 2009, up from an estimated 2 million in 2008. Some 41,000 Britons and 20,000 Australians live in Thailand.\n\n\n=== Population centres ===\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThai is the official language. It is a Kra–Dai language closely related to Lao, Shan in Myanmar, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Yunnan south to the Chinese border. It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country. The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the Thai alphabet, an abugida script that evolved from the Khmer alphabet.\nSixty-two languages were recognised by the Royal Thai Government. For the purposes of the national census, four dialects of Thai exist; these partly coincide with regional designations, such as Southern Thai and Northern Thai.\nThe largest of Thailand's minority languages is the Lao dialect of Isan spoken in the northeastern provinces. In the far south, Kelantan-Pattani Malay is the primary language of Malay Muslims. Varieties of Chinese are also spoken by the large Thai Chinese population, with the Teochew dialect best-represented. Numerous tribal languages are also spoken, including many Austroasiatic languages such as Mon, Khmer, and Mlabri; Austronesian languages such as Cham, Moken and Urak Lawoi'; Sino-Tibetan languages like Lawa, Akha, and Karen; and other Tai languages such as Phu Thai, and Saek. Hmong is a member of the Hmong–Mien languages, which is now regarded as a language family of its own.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe country's most prevalent religion is Theravada Buddhism, which is an integral part of Thai identity and culture. Active participation in Buddhism is among the highest in the world. Thailand has the second-largest number of Buddhists in the world after China. According to the 2018 National Statistical Office data, 93.46% of the country's population self-identified as Buddhists.\n\nMuslims constitute the second largest religious group in Thailand, comprising 5.37% of the population in 2018. Islam is concentrated mostly in the country's southernmost provinces: Pattani, Yala, Satun, Narathiwat, and part of Songkhla, which are predominantly Malay, most of whom are Sunni Muslims. Christians represented 1.13% of the population in 2018, with the remaining population consisting of Hindus and Sikhs, who live mostly in the country's cities. There is also a small Jewish community in Thailand dating back to the 17th century.\nThe constitution does not name an official state religion, and provides for freedom of religion. There have been no widespread reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Thai law officially recognises five religious groups: Buddhists, Muslims, Brahmin-Hindus, Sikhs, and Christians. However, some laws are inspired from Buddhist practices, such as banning alcohol sales on religious holidays.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nIn 1995, as minister of education, Sukavich Rangsitpollaid let out his plans for educational reform in Thailand. The reform was considered a landmark movement after nearly 100 years of education under the previous system. Thailand's youth literacy rate was 98.1% in 2015. Education is provided by a school system of kindergartens, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools, numerous vocational colleges, and universities. Education is compulsory up to and including age 14, while the government is mandated to provide free education through to age 17. Issues concerning university entrance have been in constant upheaval for a number of years. The country is also one of the few that still mandates uniform up to the university years, which is still a subject of ongoing debate.\nIn 2013, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology announced that 27,231 schools would receive classroom-level access to high-speed internet. However, the country's educational infrastructure was still underprepared for online teaching, as smaller and more remote schools were particularly hindered by COVID-19 restrictions.\nThe number of higher education institutions in Thailand has grown over the past decades to 156 officially. The two top-ranking universities in Thailand are Chulalongkorn University and Mahidol University. Thai universities' research output is still relatively low, even though the country's journal publications increased by 20% between 2011 and 2016. Thailand has the second highest number of English-medium private international schools in Southeast Asian Nations. Cram schools are especially popular for university entrance exams.\nStudents in ethnic minority areas score consistently lower in standardised national and international tests. This is likely due to unequal allocation of educational resources, weak teacher training, poverty, and low Thai language skill, the language of the tests. As of 2020, Thailand was ranked 89th out of 100 countries globally for English proficiency. Thailand is the third most popular study destination in ASEAN. The number of international degree students in Thailand increased by 9.7 times between 1999 and 2012, from 1,882 to 20,309 students. Most of international students come from neighbor countries like China, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nThailand ranks world's sixth, and Asia's first in the 2019 Global Health Security Index of global health security capabilities in 195 countries, making it the only developing country on the world's top ten. Thailand had 62 hospitals accredited by Joint Commission International. In 2002, Bumrungrad became the first hospital in Asia to meet the standard.\nHealth and medical care is overseen by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), with total national expenditures on health amounting to 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2009. Non-communicable diseases form the major burden of morbidity and mortality, while infectious diseases including malaria and tuberculosis, as well as traffic accidents, are also important public health issues.\nIn December 2018, the interim parliament voted to legalise the use of cannabis for medical reasons, making Thailand the first Southeast Asian country to allow the use of medical cannabis.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThai culture and traditions incorporate influences from India, China, Cambodia, and the rest of Southeast Asia. Thailand's national religion, Theravada Buddhism, is central to modern Thai identity. Thai Buddhism has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from Hinduism, animism, as well as ancestor worship. The official calendar in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the Buddhist Era (BE). Thai identity today is a social construct of the Phibun regime in the 1940s.\nSeveral ethnic groups mediated change between their traditional local culture, national Thai, and global cultural influences. Overseas Chinese also form a significant part of Thai society, particularly in and around Bangkok. Thai Chinese businesses prosper as part of the larger bamboo network.\n\nRespect for elderly and superiors (by age, position, monks, or certain professions) is Thai mores, reflecting in many classes of honorifics. Wai is a familiar Thai greeting, and is generally offered first by a person who is younger or lower in social status and position. Older siblings have duties to younger ones.\nTaboos in Thai culture include touching someone's head or pointing with the feet, as the head is considered the most sacred and the foot the lowest part of the body.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nThe origins of Thai art were influenced by Buddhist art and by scenes from the Indian epics. Traditional Thai sculpture almost exclusively depicts images of the Buddha, being very similar with the other styles from Southeast Asia. Traditional Thai paintings usually consist of book illustrations, and painted ornamentation of buildings such as palaces and temples.\nThai art was influenced by indigenous civilisations of the Mon and other civilisations. By the Sukothai and Ayutthaya periods, Thai had developed into its own unique style and was later further influenced by the other Asian styles, mostly by Sri Lankan and Chinese. Thai sculpture and painting, and the royal courts provided patronage, erecting temples and other religious shrines as acts of merit or to commemorate important events.\nTraditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two dimensions without perspective. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of composition is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century. Monk artist Khrua In Khong is well known as the first artist to introduce linear perspective to Thai traditional art.\nThe most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the Jataka stories, episodes from the life of the Buddha, the Buddhist heavens and hells, themes derived from the Thai versions of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, and scenes of daily life. Some of the scenes are influenced by Thai folklore instead of following strict Buddhist iconography.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom movement is designed to display might and riches. The temples in Ayutthaya seldom built eaves stretching from the masterhead. Buddhist temples in Thailand are known as \"wats\", from the Pāḷi vāṭa, meaning an enclosure: a temple has an enclosing wall that divides it from the secular world. Wat architecture demonstrates many differences in layout and style, but they all adhere to the same principles.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThai literature has had a long history. Even before the establishment of the Sukhothai Kingdom there existed oral and written works.\nDuring the Sukhothai Kingdom, most literary works were written in simple prose with certain alliteration schemes. Major works include King Ram Khamhaeng Inscription describing life at the time, which is considered the first literary work in Thai script, but some historians questioned its authenticity. Trai Phum Phra Ruang, written in 1345 by King Maha Thammaracha I, expounds Buddhist philosophy based on an extensive study with reference to over 30 sacred texts and could be considered the nation's first piece of research dissertation.\n\nDuring the Ayutthaya Kingdom, new poetic forms were created, with different rhyme schemes and metres. It is common to find a combination of different poetic forms in one poetic work. Lilit Yuan Phai is a narrative poem describing the war between King Borommatrailokkanat of Ayutthaya and Prince Tilokaraj of Lan Na. One literary work is Kap He Ruea, composed by Prince Thammathibet in the nirat tradition. Traditionally, the verse is sung during the royal barge procession and has been the model for subsequent poets to emulate. The same prince also composed the greatly admired Kap Ho Khlong on the Visit to Than Thongdaeng and Kap Ho Khlong Nirat Phrabat. The Thonburi period produced Ramakien, a verse drama contributed by King Taksin the Great.\nDuring the 18th century Rattanakosin period, which still fought with the Burmese, many of the early Rattanakosin works dealt with war and military strategy. Some examples are Nirat Rop Phama Thi Tha Din Daeng, Phleng Yao Rop Phama Thi Nakhon Si Thammarat. There were also verse recitals with musical accompaniment, such as Mahori telling the story of Kaki and Sepha, relating the story of Khun Chang Khun Phaen. Other recitals include Sri Thanonchai. The Thai poet Sunthorn Phu is known as \"the bard of Rattanakosin\" (Thai: กวีเอกแห่งกรุงรัตนโกสินทร์). Sunthorn Phu is best known for his epic poem Phra Aphai Mani, a versified fantasy-adventure novel, a genre of Siamese literature known as nithan kham klon (Thai: นิทานคำกลอน).\nSome of the most well-known modern Thai writers include Kukrit Pramoj, Kulap Saipradit, (penname Siburapha), Suweeriya Sirisingh (penname Botan), Chart Korbjitti, Prabda Yoon, and Duanwad Pimwana.\n\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n\nAside from folk and regional dances (southern Thailand's Menora and Ramwong, for example), the two major forms of Thai classical dance drama are Khon and Lakhon nai. In the beginning, both were exclusively court entertainments, and it was not until much later that a popular style of dance theatre, likay, evolved as a diversion for common folk. Folk dance forms include dance theater forms like likay, numerous regional dances (ram), the ritual dance ram muay, and homage to the teacher, wai khru. Both ram muay and wai khru take place before all traditional muay Thai matches.\nThe three primary classical ensembles are the Piphat, Khrueang sai, and Mahori. Mahori employ small ching hand cymbals.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nThai films are exported and exhibited in Southeast Asia. Thai cinema has developed its own unique identity.\nThe Thai heist thriller film Bad Genius (2017) was one of the most internationally successful Thai films; it broke Thai film earning records in several Asian countries, Bad Genius won in 12 categories at the 27th Suphannahong National Film Awards, and also won the Jury Award at the 16th New York Asian Film Festival with a worldwide collection of more than $42 million.\nShutter (2004) was one of the best-known Thai horror movies and was recognized worldwide. Films such as Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior (2003) and Tom-Yum-Goong (2005), starring Tony Jaa, feature distinctive aspects of Thai martial arts \"Muay Thai\". Thailand television dramas, known as Lakorn, have become popular in Thailand and regionally.\nThe entertainment industries are estimated to have directly contributed $2.1 billion in GDP to the Thai economy in 2011. They also directly supported 86,600 jobs. Amongst several dance-pop artists who have made internationally successful are \"Lisa\" Lalisa Manobal, Violette Wautier, and Tata Young.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThai cuisine is one of the most popular in the world. Common ingredients include garlic, lemongrass, kaffir lime, galangal, turmeric, coriander, and coconut milk. Each region of Thailand has its specialities: kaeng khiao wan (green curry) in the central region, som tam (green papaya salad) in the northeast, khao soi in the north, and massaman curry in the south.\nIn 2017, seven Thai dishes appeared on a list of the \"World's 50 Best Foods\"—an online worldwide poll by CNN Travel. Thailand had more dishes on the list than any other country. They were: tom yam goong (4th), pad Thai (5th), som tam (6th), massaman curry (10th), green curry (19th), Thai fried rice (24th) and nam tok mu (36th). Two desserts were also listed in CNN's 50 Best Desserts Around The World: mango sticky rice and tub tim krob.\nThe staple food in Thailand is rice, particularly jasmine rice, which forms part of almost every meal. Thailand is a leading exporter of rice, and Thais consume over 100 kg of milled rice per person per year. Thailand is also the world leader in edible insect industry and well known for its street food; Bangkok is sometimes called the street food capital of the world.\n\n\n=== Units of measurement ===\n\nThailand generally uses the metric system, but traditional units of measurement for land area are used, and imperial units of measurement are occasionally used for building materials. Years are numbered as B.E. (Buddhist Era) in educational settings, civil service, government, contracts, and newspaper datelines. However, in banking, and increasingly in industry and commerce, standard Western year (Christian or Common Era) counting is the standard practice.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMuay Thai (lit. 'Thai boxing') is a combat sport that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques. Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the late-20th to 21st centuries. Famous practitioners include Buakaw Banchamek, Samart Payakaroon, and Apidej Sit-Hirun. Association football has overtaken Muay Thai as the most widely followed sport in Thailand. The Thailand national football team has played the AFC Asian Cup six times and reached the semifinals in 1972. The country has hosted the Asian Cup twice, in 1972 and in 2007 (along with Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam for the 2007).\nVolleyball is rapidly growing as one of the most popular sports. The women's team has often participated in the World Championship, World Cup, and World Grand Prix Asian Championship. They have won the Asian Championship twice and the Asian Cup once. Takraw is a sport native to Thailand in which the players hit a rattan ball and are only allowed to use their feet, knees, chest, and head to touch the ball. Sepak takraw is a form of this sport which is similar to volleyball. A rather similar game but played only with the feet is buka ball.\nRugby is also a growing sport in Thailand with the Thailand national rugby union team rising to be ranked 61st in the world.

        "title": "Aubrey Plaza",
        "content": "Aubrey Christina Plaza (born June 26, 1984) is an American actress, comedian, and producer. She began performing improv and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. After graduating from New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Plaza made her feature film debut in Mystery Team (2009) and gained wide recognition for her role as April Ludgate on the NBC political satire sitcom Parks and Recreation (2009–2015).\nIn film, Plaza had a supporting role in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) and a leading role in Safety Not Guaranteed (2012). From 2017 to 2019, Plaza portrayed the Shadow King and Lenny Busker in the critically praised FX superhero series Legion, and produced and starred in the 2017 black comedy films The Little Hours and Ingrid Goes West. She also starred in the romantic comedy Happiest Season and thriller Black Bear (both 2020) as well as produced and played the title character in the crime film Emily the Criminal (2022).\nPlaza received nominations for a Primetime Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for her role as a strait-laced lawyer in the second season of the HBO anthology series The White Lotus (2022). Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2023. In 2024, she starred in Megalopolis and My Old Ass and as Rio Vidal in the Marvel Cinematic Universe miniseries Agatha All Along.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAubrey Christina Plaza was born on June 26, 1984, in Wilmington, Delaware. The eldest of three sisters, she was born when her parents, Bernadette and David Plaza, were 19 and 20. Plaza said she was inspired by their work ethic; when she was young, they worked various jobs to make ends meet and attended night school in pursuit of their respective professional qualifications to become an attorney and financial advisor. Her paternal family is Puerto Rican: her grandfather was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and moved to the mainland US when he was 17 years old. She has some Indigenous American (Taíno) and Basque heritage. Plaza's mother, who was adopted, is of Irish descent; Plaza's maternal (adoptive) grandparents were from Ireland, where their family remained, and her grandfather was also himself adopted. While her parents worked, Plaza was raised by her Irish grandparents and her Puerto Rican family.\nAs a child, Plaza loved films and actively engaged in imaginative play. She described herself as shy and quiet until middle school, when she discovered and acted in community theater. Plaza said her upbringing was \"very Catholic\", and she attended Ursuline Academy, an all-girls Catholic school. While in high school, she was student-council president of her school, performed in theatrical productions with the Wilmington Drama League and the Delaware Theatre Company, and made short films as a hobby. Aged sixteen, she represented Ursuline at a Delaware youth leadership conference held by Joe Biden. As a teen, Plaza's aunt gave her a job at a video store, during which she discovered her love of independent films and filmmakers that inspired her, such as John Waters and Christopher Guest. Waters' satirical film Serial Mom (1994) made a significant impact on her, and she connected with his comedic sensibility. She also enrolled at an improv school in Philadelphia and, in 2001, attended New York Film Academy's summer camp for filmmaking. She graduated the following year from Ursuline Academy and moved to New York. Plaza studied film and television production at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, graduating in 2006.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 2004–2009: career beginnings ===\n\nPlaza trained and performed improv and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre since 2004. She also performed at the Laugh Factory and The Improv. Plaza named Amy Poehler as an inspiration for her decision to perform improv. She described her experience at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre as \"intoxicating\", explaining: \"It just truly felt like we are in an underground – literally, underground – theatre doing an art form that is so fucking hard, and just so fun when you get it right.\" While she was in film school, she had an internship at Saturday Night Live for the 2004–2005 season, and then became an NBC page. During this apprenticeship she appeared in an episode of 30 Rock in 2006. Though being a page at 30 Rockefeller Plaza was a lower position than her SNL internship, it is a \"legendary\" and highly selective program. She was also in two short films in 2006, Killswitch and In Love. In 2008, she was part of an Improv Everywhere sketch where she and others took an entire desktop computer and monitor to a Starbucks in New York City. Plaza had a recurring role in Maggie Carey's web series The Jeannie Tate Show, played the role of Robin Gibney in ESPN's Mayne Street (2008), and appeared in the first episode of \"Terrible Decisions with Ben Schwartz\" on Funny or Die.\nIn 2009, she made her feature film debut in Derrick Comedy's Mystery Team. She then played a standup comic and Seth Rogen's love interest in the black comedy-drama film Funny People, directed by Judd Apatow. As she did not have experience performing standup, she signed up for open mic nights at comedy clubs and bars in New York City to prepare for the role. For her audition tape, she performed and recorded five minutes of standup comedy at her friend Donald Glover's standup show. When Plaza flew to Los Angeles for Funny People, the film's casting director Allison Jones asked her if she wanted to attend other meetings while she was in the city. Jones set up a meeting with Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, who were developing Parks and Recreation. At the meeting, they told her the idea for the show's pilot and that they were considering giving Amy Poehler's character an assistant who was a doltish blonde. Plaza pitched them instead the character of a smart intern who is at the department only for college credit and does not care about the job, which Plaza thought would be an interesting, comedic contrast with Poehler's character. They liked the concept for the character and created April Ludgate. Plaza, who said that in real life she was like Poehler's earnestly hard-working character, took inspiration from her younger sister for April's apathetic disposition. Plaza played the role from 2009 to 2015. She received praise for her performance, and April was considered one of the show's breakout characters.\n\n\n=== 2010–2016: rise in film and television ===\n\nWhile Plaza was in Los Angeles for Funny People and Parks and Recreation, Allison Jones also recommended that she audition for Edgar Wright's romantic action comedy film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010). Plaza was cast in the film, playing the supporting character Julie Powers. On March 12, 2010, Plaza performed at A Night of 140 Tweets: A Celebrity Tweetathon for Haiti, produced by Rob Huebel, Paul Scheer, Ben Stiller, and Mike Rosenstein, at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles. In the breaks between filming Parks and Recreation seasons, Plaza appeared in other projects, films and television series. She appeared in a CollegeHumor short alongside Jason Bateman and Will Arnett. In 2011, she had a recurring role in the sketch comedy series Portlandia, and guest starred as \"The Princess\" in the comedic sci-fi web series Troopers on CollegeHumor. She also appeared in the comedy-drama film Damsels in Distress (2011) and the romantic comedy 10 Years (2011).\nIn 2012, Plaza had her first starring role in a major film in the comedy Safety Not Guaranteed, playing a magazine intern who answers a curious want ad. Her performance received positive reviews, and she won the award for Breakthrough Performance (Female) at the 2012 Young Hollywood Awards. In 2013, she portrayed the character Sacagawea in the Drunk History episode \"Nashville\" during a segment on Lewis and Clark's expedition. In 2013, she also had the starring role in the CBS Film The To Do List. In an impromptu attempt to promote the film, Plaza ran onto the stage at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards and grabbed Will Ferrell's award for Comedic Genius, inspired by Kanye West's interruption of Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, with a drink in hand while the film's name was written across her chest. She was ejected from the studio lot where the ceremony was held.\nPlaza voiced Eska in the animated fantasy action television series The Legend of Korra (2013–2014). She also voiced Grumpy Cat in the Lifetime Network's television film Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever (2014). Plaza starred in the 2014 horror comedy film Life After Beth about a young woman who returns from the dead, written and directed by her husband Jeff Baena, and in Hal Hartley's drama film Ned Rifle (2014).\nIn 2016, Plaza starred in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates alongside Zac Efron, Anna Kendrick, and Adam DeVine. Her role as the rebellious Tatiana earned her critical praise. Then, she was a guest star on HarmonQuest, as a gnome named \"Hawaiian Coffee\" and portrayed Aaron Burr in the \"Hamilton\" episode of Drunk History. She also provided a guest voice for the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"Mall Girl Pearl\" with Betty White. That same year, she portrayed Cat Adams, a contract killer, first in Season 11 of the CBS television series Criminal Minds, and then again in Season 12 and 15.\nAlso in 2016 she played Lenore in Dirty Grandpa beside Zoey Deutch, Zac Efron and Robert De Niro.\n\n\n=== 2017–present: career expansion ===\n\nIn 2017, Plaza starred in and produced the films The Little Hours and Ingrid Goes West. The former is a black comedy about medieval nuns loosely based on stories from The Decameron. Both films premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In Ingrid Goes West, Plaza portrayed the social media obsessed fan of an influencer played by Elizabeth Olsen. Variety film critic Peter Debruge praised Plaza's performance writing: \"Plaza's tortured performance captures all of this, which is saying something for an actress whose blasé persona hinges on the fact that she can't be bothered: Nobody plays ambivalence better, and yet, Plaza allows herself to seem vulnerable here.\" The film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. The following year, she starred in the indie comedy An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, Plaza portrayed both Amahl Farouk / Shadow King and Lenny Busker in the FX series Legion, which was critically praised along with Plaza's performance. The role of Lenny was originally written for a middle aged man. When Plaza was offered it, she requested that the character's dialogue and actions remain, as she did not want it \"being tied down to anything gender-wise\". David Bowie was an inspiration for her approach to the role. She was given creative freedom with the character and collaborated with directors and choreographers on sequences that were ambiguously described on the page. In 2019 and 2020, Plaza hosted the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2019, she starred in Child's Play, a reboot of the 1988 film, as Andy's mother who brings home a killer doll, Chucky.\nIn 2020, Plaza played Riley Johnson in the romantic comedy Happiest Season, and produced and starred in the independent experimental thriller Black Bear, garnering critical acclaim for her performance. Black Bear follows a filmmaker who retreats to a cabin in the mountains to find inspiration for her next film. NME wrote that the film \"examin[es] the power dynamics in filmmaking\", and Collider considered it an exploration of \"human relationships, gender dynamics, and celebrity\".\nIn 2021, Plaza wrote and made her directorial debut with the episode \"Quiet Illness\" of the Showtime anthology series Cinema Toast. Created by her partner Jeff Baena, the series reinvents imagery from public domain films to tell different stories. In crafting \"Quiet Illness\", Plaza was inspired by actress Loretta Young's experiences and footage of her appearances. She edited various film and television clips starring Young into a psychological thriller about a woman's self-esteem, and cast Christina Ricci as a voice narrator. She described the project as \"trippy\" with a \"pandemic-filming style\". Plaza said that she has always had an interest in directing, and she had been writing a project during the COVID-19 pandemic. She also wrote a children's book with Dan Murphy, The Legend of the Christmas Witch (2021), illustrated by Julia Iredale.\nPlaza produced and starred as the titular character in the independent film Emily the Criminal (2022), portraying a woman saddled with student debt and compelled into criminal activity. Her performance and the film received critical acclaim, with The New York Times calling it \"wonderfully nuanced\", Little White Lies writing that it is \"perhaps Plaza’s best performance to date\", and the Chicago Sun-Times deeming it \"richly layered work\" and \"one of the best performances of the year in one of the best movies of the year\". She also appeared in the film Spin Me Round, which premiered at the South by Southwest film festival in 2022. In the second season of the HBO anthology series The White Lotus, Plaza portrayed Harper, a lawyer vacationing in Sicily with her husband. For her performance in the series, she received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. On August 25, 2022, the adult animated sitcom Little Demon premiered on FXX, which features the voices of Plaza (who is also an executive producer), Danny DeVito, and Lucy DeVito. In October 2022, Plaza was given the Artist of Distinction Award at the Newport Beach Film Festival.\nAt the 2023 Independent Spirit Awards, Plaza received a nomination for Best Lead Performance for Emily the Criminal, as well as a nomination for Best First Feature as producer. In January 2023, she hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time and appeared in multiple sketches. In May, Plaza received criticism for participating in a parody ad for \"Wood Milk\", which mocked plant-based milks in favor of dairy. In July, it was announced that she would be making her stage debut in an off-Broadway revival of John Patrick Shanley's Danny and the Deep Blue Sea, a two-hander about strangers who become lovers after meeting at a dive bar, opposite her Black Bear costar Christopher Abbott. She was nominated for the Drama League Distinguished Performance Award. Time magazine named Plaza one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2023.\nIn 2024, Plaza and her Parks and Recreation costar Nick Offerman reunited in a Mountain Dew ad that aired during the Super Bowl LVIII broadcast. She was confirmed to be starring in John Waters's first film in over 20 years, Liarmouth, based on his novel of the same name. Plaza portrays the future self of Elliott Labrant in the comedy film My Old Ass (2024), and TV presenter Wow Platinum in Francis Ford Coppola's epic science fiction drama Megalopolis (2024). She portrayed Rio Vidal / Death in the Disney+ miniseries Agatha All Along, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which premiered on September 18, 2024.\nPlaza has been the spokesperson for Cointreau's \"MargaRight\" advertising campaign since 2023.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Relationships ===\n\nPlaza has stated that she falls in love with both women and men. She met and started dating actor Michael Cera when they were filming Scott Pilgrim vs. the World; during their 18-month relationship, Plaza and Cera almost got married as a joke while driving through Las Vegas. Cera explained that \"the idea was to then get a divorce right away, so we could call each other 'my ex-husband' and 'my ex-wife' at like[,] 20 [years old].\"\nShe met writer and director Jeff Baena at a game night in 2011, and they began a relationship. The couple were frequent creative collaborators, with Plaza starring in four of Baena's films. He proposed to her at a site related to the Basque witch trials in Zugarramurdi, before they spontaneously got married in 2021. Deciding to wed on their tenth anniversary together to celebrate, they had a small ceremony in their backyard. They quietly separated in September 2024 after experiencing marital difficulties, and Plaza moved to New York but remained in frequent contact with Baena. On January 3, 2025, Baena was found dead; the cause of death was suicide. Plaza pulled out of presenting at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards (held on January 5) before hosting part of the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special on February 16, during which she paid tribute to Baena by wearing a tie-dye shirt like the ones they wore for their wedding.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nPlaza had a stroke when she was 20 years old, which caused temporary paralysis and temporary expressive aphasia. Several years later, she had a transient ischemic attack while on the set of Parks and Recreation. She has discussed that she experiences social anxiety.\nA recreational basketball player, Plaza has had two ACL tears from the sport: first in the mid-2010s during a recreational league game, and then in 2024 when she participated in a game of knockout ahead of the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game.\n\n\n== Acting credits ==\n\nAccording to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, Plaza's most critically acclaimed films include Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), Safety Not Guaranteed (2012), Ned Rifle (2014), Ingrid Goes West (2017), The Little Hours (2017), Black Bear (2020), Happiest Season (2020), Emily the Criminal (2022), and My Old Ass (2024).

Since November 2016, she has appeared in commercial advertisements for investment and financial service company Citigroup. In January 2017, she made her modelling debut in Calvin Klein's \"By Appointment\" campaign. The following month, she was signed to the agency IMG Models. Brown appeared in the advertisement campaign of the Italian brand Moncler in the summer of 2018. Brown has also made appearances on the cover of Vogue.\n\n\n=== 2018–present ===\nBrown was chosen to voice in the Darren Aronofsky-produced virtual reality experience Spheres: Songs of Spacetime. In 2018, she was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time, becoming the youngest person to be included in the list. Additionally, she was named by Time magazine as one of the most influential teens of 2017 and of 2018. That year, she become the youngest person ever to be appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. EA Games announced that Brown collaborated with The Sims 4 programmers to feature in the Sims 4 Positivity Challenge. In 2018, The Hollywood Reporter ranked Brown as amongst Hollywood's top thirty stars under age eighteen.\n\nBrown made her feature film debut in 2019 in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the sequel to the 2014 film Godzilla. She reprised her role in the next sequel, Godzilla vs. Kong (2021). She became the ambassador of UEFA's Together #WePlayStrong campaign. In 2019, Brown launched Florence by Mills, her own beauty product line. It is available at UK pharmacy Boots, Walmart in the United States and Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada. In 2020, Brown starred in and produced the film adaptation of The Enola Holmes Mysteries.\nIn 2022, Brown reprised her role as Enola Holmes in the sequel, Enola Holmes 2, and according to Variety earned $10 million for the role, emerging as one of the year's highest paid actresses in Hollywood. That year, she was also made an ambassador of the fashion brand Louis Vuitton. Brown released her debut novel, Nineteen Steps, based on her own family history, in September 2023. The novel is described as an \"epic story of love, loss and secrets\".\nIn 2024, Brown starred in and executive produced the fantasy film Damsel for Netflix, directed by Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo based on a screenplay by Dan Mazeau.\nIn 2025, she starred in the Russo brothers's The Electric State, an adaptation of Simon Stålenhag's graphic novel of the same name.\n\n\n== Media image ==\nBrown has been branded a \"stream queen\" by some media due to her predominantly appearing in content originally released on streaming services, mainly Netflix. Louis Chilton of The Independent wrote that while actors were often segregated based on medium such as film or television, \"as the money and creative prestige migrated to television, the line between movie stars and TV actors has become more porous, and it was into this amorphous environment that streaming was born – meaning that there's never really been such a thing as a 'streaming actor'. Until Brown, that is\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBrown came into the public eye at age 12 after being cast in Stranger Things. At age 14, memes using homophobic quotes which were falsely attributed to Brown began circulating on social media, which Brown stated was one of the reasons she eventually left Twitter. In addition to online bullying, she has also faced social media users and articles sexualising her. In response, Brown captioned a 2020 Instagram post on her 16th birthday with the following comment:\n\nThere are moments I get frustrated from the inaccuracy, inappropriate comments, sexualisation and unnecessary insults that  have ultimately resulted in pain and insecurity for me.  \nAfter Brown turned 18 in February 2022, her social media profiles began to be flooded by sexually explicit material from users.\nIn 2021, Brown began a relationship with actor Jake Bongiovi. In April 2023, she announced their engagement. On 27 May 2024, People reported that the couple had married in a private ceremony the previous weekend. Brown also announced that she had chosen to take her husband's last name. They live in the state of Georgia. On 21 August 2025, Brown and Bongiovi announced that they had adopted a baby girl.\nAs of August 2022, she has been an online student at Purdue University Global, studying health and human services.\nOn 3 March 2025, addressing media backlash over her appearance, Brown posted a video on her Instagram account criticising  journalists, including multiple reporters for Daily Mail and former Great British Bake Off host Matt Lucas for what she said was bullying and body shaming. Brown stated that as an adult she should not be expected to continue looking like a child. The next day, Lucas posted an apology on Instagram for his comments.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Music videos ===\n\n\n=== Video games ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBrown, Millie Bobby (2023).

        "title": "Kristi Noem",
        "content": "Kristi Lynn Arnold Noem ( NOHM; née Arnold; born November 30, 1971) is an American politician serving since 2025 as the 8th United States secretary of homeland security. A member of the Republican Party, she served from 2019 to 2025 as the 33rd governor of South Dakota and from 2011 to 2019 represented South Dakota's at-large congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nBorn in Watertown, South Dakota, Noem began her political career in the South Dakota House of Representatives, serving from 2007 to 2011. Noem was elected as the first female governor of South Dakota in 2018 with the endorsement of President Donald Trump. She gained national attention during the COVID-19 pandemic for opposing statewide mask mandates and advocating voluntary measures. Noem has conservative positions on most domestic issues, particularly gun rights, abortion, and immigration.\nNoem is a farmer, rancher, and member of the Civil Air Patrol. She has published two autobiographies, Not My First Rodeo: Lessons from the Heartland (2022) and No Going Back (2024), which sparked controversy for its account of her killing a young family dog and inaccurate claims about meeting with foreign leaders. Donald Trump nominated her for Secretary of Homeland Security in his second cabinet. She was confirmed in January 2025 by a Senate vote of 59–34.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNoem was born Kristi Lynn Arnold to Ron and Corinne Arnold on November 30, 1971, in Watertown, South Dakota, and raised with her siblings on the family ranch and farm in Hazel, South Dakota. She has Norwegian ancestry. In 1990, Noem graduated from Hamlin High School in Hayti, South Dakota, and was crowned South Dakota Snow Queen.\nNoem attended Northern State University from 1990 to 1994 but did not graduate. In March 1994, her father was killed in a grain bin accident and Noem left college early to run the family farm.  Her daughter, Kassidy, was born weeks later, on April 21, 1994. She added a hunting lodge and restaurant to the family property. Her siblings also moved back to help expand the businesses.\nNoem subsequently took classes at the Watertown campus of Mount Marty College and at South Dakota State University, and online classes from the University of South Dakota. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in political science from South Dakota State University in 2012 while serving as a U.S. representative. The Washington Post dubbed her Capitol Hill's \"most powerful intern\" for receiving college intern credits from her position as a member of Congress.\n\n\n== South Dakota House of Representatives (2007–2011) ==\nIn 2006, Noem won a seat as a Republican in the South Dakota House of Representatives, representing the 6th district, comprising parts of Beadle, Clark, Codington, Hamlin, and Kingsbury counties. In 2006, she won with 39% of the vote. In 2008, she was reelected with 41% of the vote.\nNoem served for four years, from 2007 to 2010. She was an assistant majority leader during her second term. During her tenure, Noem was the prime sponsor of 11 bills that became law, including several property tax reforms and two bills to increase gun rights in South Dakota. In 2009, she served as vice chair of the Agriculture Land Assessment Advisory Task Force. Senator Larry Rhoden chaired the task force, and later served as her lieutenant governor. During her tenure, she joined the Civil Air Patrol as a \"state legislative member\". She holds the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives (2011–2019) ==\n\nIn 2010, Noem ran for South Dakota's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. She won the Republican primary and defeated incumbent Democrat Stephanie Herseth Sandlin in the general election. Noem was reelected three times, serving in Congress until 2019.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\n\nThe 2011 House Republican 87-member freshman class elected Noem as liaison to the House Republican leadership, making her the second woman member of the House GOP leadership. According to The Hill, her role was to push the leadership to make significant cuts to federal government spending and to help Speaker John Boehner manage the expectations of the freshman class. In March 2011, Republican Representative Pete Sessions of Texas named Noem one of the 12 regional directors for the National Republican Congressional Committee during the 2012 election campaign.\nOn March 8, 2011, she announced the formation of a leadership political action committee, KRISTI PAC. Former South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Steve Kirby is its treasurer. Noem was among the top freshman Republicans in PAC fundraising in the first quarter of 2011, raising $169,000 from PACs.\n\n\n==== Abortion ====\nNoem co-sponsored legislation that would federally ban abortion. In 2015, she co-sponsored a bill to amend the 14th Amendment to define human life and personhood as beginning at fertilization, federally banning abortion from the moment of fertilization. She also voted for a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n==== Energy and environment ====\nNoem denies the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2022 she said she believes \"the science has been varied on it, and it hasn't been proven to me that what we're doing is affecting the climate.\"\nNoem has said that the U.S. needs an \"all-of-the-above energy approach\" that includes renewables like wind and ethanol while still realizing the need for a \"balanced energy mix\" that ends American dependence on foreign oil.\nNoem supported the Keystone XL Pipeline and supports offshore oil drilling. She co-sponsored three bills that she argued would reduce American dependence on foreign oil by ending the 2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and reopening sales on oil leases in the Gulf and off the coast of Virginia. In 2011, she sponsored a measure to block Environmental Protection Agency funding for tighter air pollution standards for coarse particulates.\nNoem opposed a bill introduced by South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson that would designate over 48,000 acres (190 km2) of the Buffalo Gap National Grassland as protected wilderness. She supports the designation of the land as a national grassland. She said the land is already managed as roadless areas similar to wilderness and argued that changing the land's designation to wilderness would further limit leaseholder access to the land and imperil grazing rights.\n\n\n==== Foreign affairs ====\nFrom 2013 to 2015, Noem served on the House Armed Services Committee, where she worked on the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act. Her appointment to the committee was seen as a benefit to South Dakota's Ellsworth Air Force Base. In March 2011, Noem was critical of President Barack Obama's approach to the NATO-led military intervention in the 2011 Libyan civil war, calling on him to provide more information about the U.S.'s role in the conflict, and characterizing his statements as vague and ambiguous.\n\n\n==== Health care ====\nNoem opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has voted to repeal it. Having unsuccessfully sought to repeal it, she sought to defund it while retaining measures such as the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the provision allowing parents to keep their children on their health insurance plan into their 20s, and the high-risk pools. Noem wanted to add such provisions to federal law as limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and allowing patients to buy health insurance plans from other states. She supported cuts to Medicaid funding proposed by Republican Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan. A study found that this action would reduce benefits for South Dakota Medicaid recipients by 55 percent.\n\n\n==== Immigrants and refugees ====\nNoem supported President Donald Trump's 2017 Executive Order 13769, that suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and banned all travel to the U.S. by nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. She said she supported a temporary ban on accepting refugees from \"terrorist-held\" areas, but \"did not address whether she supports other aspects of the order, which led to the detention of legal U.S. residents such as green-card holders, and people with dual citizenship as they reentered the country\" in the aftermath of the order's issuance.\nIn 2019, Noem consented to South Dakota's participation in the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program following a Trump executive order that allowed state and local governments to opt out.\n\n\n==== In-vitro fertilization and embryonic stem-cell research ====\nIn August 2010, while running for Congress, Noem responded to a questionnaire from the Christian Coalition voter guide indicating that she would vote to ban embryonic stem-cell research. In 2015, she co-sponsored legislation to amend the 14th Amendment to define human life and personhood as beginning at the moment of fertilization, without exceptions for in-vitro fertilization or embryonic stem-cell research.\n\n\n==== Taxes ====\nIn 2017, Noem was on the conference committee that negotiated the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which she touted as giving the average South Dakota family a $1,200 tax cut.\nIn 2018, Noem was reported to have \"pitched the idea to members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus\" to attach her online sales tax bill to the government funding package as part of an omnibus. A court case under consideration in the South Dakota Supreme Court involved requiring \"certain out-of-state retailers to collect its sales taxes.\" Noem said that South Dakota businesses (and by extension businesses nationwide) \"could be forced to comply with 1,000 different tax structures nationwide without the tools necessary to do so\", adding that her legislation \"provides a necessary fix.\"\nNoem has called the budget deficit one of the most important issues facing Congress. She cosponsored H. J. Res. 2, which would require that total spending for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts. She cited the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Medicaid, high-speed rail projects, cap-and-trade technical assistance, and subsidies for the Washington Metro rapid transit system as examples of federal programs where she would like to see cuts.\nIn 2011, Noem indicated that she would vote to raise the federal debt ceiling, but only if \"tied to budget reforms that change the way we spend our dollars and how Washington, D.C., does business. It won’t just be a one-time spending cut.\" She ultimately voted for S. 365, The Budget Control Act of 2011, which allowed Obama to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for spending cuts to be decided by a bipartisan committee. She also said she wanted to eliminate the estate tax, lower the corporate tax rate, and simplify the tax code. She said she would not raise taxes to balance the budget.\nCommittee assignments\n\nCommittee on Ways and Means\nSubcommittee on Human Resources\nSubcommittee on Select Revenue Measures\nCaucus memberships\n\nRepublican Study Committee\nCongressional Arts Caucus\nAfterschool Caucuses\nCongressional Western Caucus\n\n\n== Governor of South Dakota (2019–2025) ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== 2018 ====\n\nIn November 2016, Noem announced she would run for governor of South Dakota in 2018 rather than seek reelection to Congress. She defeated South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley in the June Republican primary, 56 to 44 percent, and Democratic nominee Billie Sutton in the general election, 51 to 48 percent.\n\n\n==== 2022 ====\n\nIn November 2021, Noem announced she was running for reelection as governor. State Representative Steven Haugaard, a Republican, announced he was running against Noem. In February 2022, House Democratic Minority Leader Jamie Smith announced he was seeking the Democratic nomination.\nIn the Republican primary in June, Noem defeated Haugaard, 76% to 24%. In the general election, she defeated Smith, 62% to 35%. Despite predictions of a competitive race, Noem flipped 17 counties that had previously voted Democratic and set a record for the most votes received by a candidate for governor in South Dakota.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\nNoem was sworn in as governor on January 5, 2019, the first woman in that office in the state.\n\n\n==== Abortion ====\nNoem is anti-abortion. She has been lauded by the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List and said she intends to maintain her 100% anti-abortion voting record.\nIn 2019, Noem signed bills restricting abortion, saying they would \"crack down on abortion providers in South Dakota\" and that a \"strong and growing body of medical research provides evidence that unborn babies can feel, think, and recognize sounds in the womb. These are people, they must be given the same basic dignities as anyone else.\"\nFollowing the overturning of Roe v. Wade, South Dakota became one of the first states to enact trigger laws banning abortions. Noem defended South Dakota's abortion ban, which only allows exceptions in cases in which the mother's life is in danger. When asked about the case of the 10-year-old child abuse victim who traveled from Ohio to Indiana to receive an abortion, Noem said she would not support changing the law to allow exceptions for rape victims, explaining that she did not \"believe a tragic situation should be perpetuated by another tragedy\".\nNoem proclaimed 2024 the \"Freedom for Life Year\", promoting anti-abortion laws. In April 2024, she announced that she had reversed her support for a federal ban on abortion, saying she believed abortion law should be determined at the state level, and continued to support South Dakota's law banning abortion except to save the life of the pregnant patient, without exceptions for rape or incest.\n\n\n==== Early Childhood Education ====\nNoem is a vocal opponent of subsidized child care. Her administration rejected $7.5 million in federal funding for free summer meal programs for low-income residents and defeated multiple attempts to provide school lunches for eligible students. In 2023, Noem said, \"I just don't think it's the government's job to pay or to raise people's children for them\".\n\n\n==== Access to public records ====\nWhile running for governor in 2018, Noem made government transparency part of her platform. In her first State of the State address she pledged to \"work toward building the most transparent administration South Dakota has ever seen\".\nThroughout her tenure, news outlets and government transparency advocates sued Noem for failing to provide the transparency she advocated. Complaints included denial of immediate access to a state-funded report about the alleged presence of critical race theory and \"divisive concepts\" in South Dakota schools; denial of access to pardon records; not releasing the cost of the governor's security team; whipping votes against a bill to make public records of the cost of the governor's security; and attempts to seal records on an ethics investigation involving her daughter.\n\n\n==== Anti-protest legislation ====\nIn response to protests against the Keystone Pipeline, Noem's office collaborated with the energy company TransCanada Corporation to develop anti-protest legislation, which Noem signed into law in 2019. The law created a fund to cover the costs of policing pipeline protests. Another law was passed to raise revenue for the fund by creating civil penalties for advising, directing, or encouraging participation in rioting. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation banned Noem from their grounds as a result. The Indigenous Environmental Network, Sierra Club, and other groups challenged the laws in suits, arguing that they violated First Amendment rights by incentivizing the state to sue protesters. In 2020, after a federal court struck down sections of the legislation as unconstitutional, Noem brought legislation to repeal sections of the previous bill and clarify the definition of \"incitement to riot\".\n\n\n==== China ====\nNoem has called China \"an enemy\" of the U.S. In 2022, she issued an order banning TikTok from state-owned devices, saying the \"Chinese Communist Party uses information it gathers on TikTok to manipulate the American people\". In 2023, she signed an order prohibiting the downloading or use of any application or visiting of any site owned by the Chinese company Tencent, including WeChat, on state-owned devices. In 2024, she signed a bill prohibiting the governments of six countries—China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Venezuela—and entities from those countries from buying agricultural land in South Dakota.\n\n\n==== Conflict of interest action to professionally benefit daughter ====\nIn 2020, after Noem's 26-year-old daughter, Kassidy Peters, was denied a real estate appraisal license, Noem summoned to her office Sherry Bren, a state employee who had directed South Dakota's Appraiser Certification Program for 30 years. Attendees included Peters, Noem's chief of staff Tony Venhuizen, Department of Labor Attorney Amber Mulder and Labor Secretary Marcia Hultman.\nBy telephone, the group was joined by the governor's general counsel, Tom Hart, and a lawyer from the state's Department of Labor and Regulation, Graham Oey. A week later, Hultman demanded Bren's resignation. Bren repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, tried to resolve the issues short of resigning, eventually filing an age discrimination complaint. She received a $200,000 settlement as part of a nondisclosure agreement to withdraw her complaint and leave her position. Noem's spokesperson characterized the allegations as an example of how Noem cut through \"bureaucratic red tape\".\nAfter the Associated Press published a story about the incident, the State Senate's Government Operations and Audit Committee was delegated to investigate. In October 2021, the Committee invited Hultman and Bren to come before it to discuss the appraisal program in light of the controversy. On December 14, 2021, Bren testified before the Government Operations and Audit Committee. She said that Peters received an Agreed Disposition around March/April 2020. Around July 20, 2020, Peters received a letter and/or Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law when she failed to meet the requirements of the Agreed Disposition. Bren said that on July 26, Department of Labor attorney Amber Mulder told her to be prepared to discuss \"what is the definition of a serious deficiency; what criteria do you use for denials; how many are denied each year; how many are approved; are we saying that Kassidy can take certain classes and resubmit\".\nBren said she felt \"very nervous\" and \"intimidated\" when meeting with Noem and attorneys and Labor Secretary Hultman. Bren mentioned during the meeting at the mansion some appraisal classes that she thought would be helpful to Peters. Bren said that Noem was upset that she was just now hearing about the classes. Bren testified that the decision to depart from recognized upgrade procedures and offer a third opportunity would be Hultman's. Bren said this was beyond the recognized procedures and \"not normal.\"\nOn November 1, 2021, the Government Accountability Board set an agenda to discuss this issue and another issue based on complaints brought by Ravnsborg. On December 15, 2021, the Government Accountability Board referred one of the two complaints to Noem for a response and sent the other back to the complainant for further information. On February 3, 2022, the Government Accountability Board referred the second complaint to Noem for a response and gave her until April 15, 2022, to answer both pending complaints.\nOn February 24, 2022, Republican State Representative John Mills introduced House Resolution 7004, \"Addressing the Governor's unacceptable actions in matters related to the appraiser certification program\", against Noem. On March 1, the resolution was debated and failed by a margin of 29 to 38 with three excused, including Noem's primary opponent Steven Haugaard and U.S. House candidate Taffy Howard.\n\n\n==== Conflict with Native American tribes ====\nIn 2024, it was reported that all nine tribes of South Dakota banned Noem from entering any tribal lands, prohibiting her from entering almost 20% of South Dakota. Other media reported that one of the nine tribes, the Yankton Sioux, had not officially banned Noem. The Oglala Sioux banned Noem in February, followed by the Cheyenne River Sioux, the Standing Rock Sioux, and the Rosebud Sioux in April, and the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, the Crow Creek Sioux, and the Flandreau Santee Sioux in May.\nThe tribes took action after demanding that Noem apologize for her comments about them. In January 2024, Noem said that an \"invasion is coming over the southern border\" of the United States, and the \"enemy is the Mexican drug cartels\", which are \"perpetrating violence in each of our states, even here in South Dakota ... The cartels are using our reservations to facilitate the spread of drugs throughout the Midwest.\" In March 2024, Noem said there were \"some tribal leaders that I believe are personally benefiting from the cartels being there\", but gave no evidence, and that there were people \"who actually live in those situations, who call me and text me every day and say, 'Please, dear governor, please come help us in Pine Ridge. We are scared.'\" She added: \"they live with 80% to 90% unemployment. Their kids don't have any hope. They don't have parents who show up and help them.\"\nAround January 2025, Noem apologized to the tribes for the misunderstanding between them, and the Flandreau Santee Sioux tribe dissolved its order banning Noem from its land. The tribe said, \"the Governor has shown us that she is committed to protecting the people of South Dakota including the citizens of the nine Tribal Nations, who share mutual borders with the state\", and expressed its support for her nomination as the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n\n==== COVID-19 pandemic ====\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in South Dakota, Noem was at first open to containment strategies. Over the following months, she segued to a hands-off approach. In November 2020, Noem used pandemic relief funds to promote tourism during a surge in cases in the state. She did not implement face mask mandates, raised doubts about the efficacy of mask-wearing, encouraged large gatherings without social distancing or mask-wearing, and questioned public health experts' advice.\nAs of December 2020, Noem was one of few governors who had not maintained statewide stay-at-home orders or face-mask mandates. Her response mirrored Trump's rhetoric and handling of COVID-19. She was rewarded for her COVID-19 response with a speech at the August 2020 Republican National Convention, which elevated her national profile. The Argus Leader called the RNC speech a \"defining moment in her political career\".\nEarly in the pandemic, Noem requested that the legislature pass a bill giving the state health secretary and county officials the power to close businesses and other entities. The House rejected the bill. On March 13, 2020, Noem ordered K-12 schools to close, and on April 6, she extended that order for the remainder of the school year. Also on April 6, Noem ordered businesses and local governments to practice social distancing and other CDC guidelines.\nEarly on, Noem also emphasized South Dakota's role in evaluating hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that Trump had touted as a cure for COVID-19. It was never shown to be useful in treating COVID-19 but can produce fatal cardiac arrhythmia.\nIn early 2020 one of the largest COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S. occurred in South Dakota. The Smithfield Foods production plant in Sioux Falls had four deaths, with nearly 1,300 workers and their family members testing positive. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar misinformed a group of legislators that meatpacking plants employees were unlikely to be infected at work, but that their \"home and social\" habits were spreading the contagion. Noem may have been the first officeholder to publicly express that view.\nOn April 13, 2020, of an outbreak where hundreds of workers had tested positive at a Smithfield pork plant, she told Fox News, \"We believe that 99 percent of what's going on today wasn't happening inside the facility\". The industry didn't explain the deaths from COVID-19 of USDA food-safety inspectors from three plants. Almost 200 inspectors contracted symptomatic COVID-19.\nIn the pandemic's early days, the Food Safety and Inspection Service did not provide protective equipment to its monitors, forbidding them from wearing masks in the slaughterhouses as it feared that might accentuate the risks. On April 9, 2020, the agency said its inspectors would be allowed to wear masks if the meatpacking plants' owners gave the federal employees permission to do so. Inspectors were expected to supply their own masks. A month later, after publication of the risk of spreading the virus, the USDA started giving its inspectors masks. Noem had said that the plant was in full operation as an essential food manufacturing facility. Forty-eight of Smithfield's workers were hospitalized. On April 6, 2020, Noem issued an executive order that said people \"shall\" follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; she also ordered everyone over age 65 in Minnehaha and Lincoln counties to stay home for three weeks.\nNoem did not mandate social distancing or the wearing of face masks at a July 3, 2020, event at Mount Rushmore with Trump present. Health experts warned that large gatherings without social distancing or mask-wearing posed a risk to public health. Noem publicly doubted scientific recommendations on the usefulness of masks. In an opinion piece in the Rapid City Journal, she defended her views, citing analysis by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a group known for promoting pseudoscience. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons had called vaccination the equivalent of \"human experimentation.\"\nCOVID cases increased drastically in South Dakota after the 2020 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, in which Noem participated. COVID-19 patients hospitalized in South Dakota on October 22, 2020, reached a record high of 355, including 75 in Intensive Care Units. South Dakota's two largest hospital systems rescheduled elective procedures to increase available space and personnel to accommodate the surge. In the absence of a statewide mask mandate, hospital systems urged people to wear masks while in the company of those outside their own households. Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken advised his constituents, \"Wear a dang mask.\"\nSixteen weeks after Trump's 2020 executive order that provided enhanced weekly unemployment benefits of $300 as part of the U.S. federal government response to the pandemic, Noem opted out of the program, citing a low state unemployment rate. South Dakota was the only state to refuse the assistance. Its jobless rate in June was 7.2%, up from 3.1% in March, though down from 10.9% in April. Acceptance of the funding required the state to augment the benefit by $100 unless other jobless assistance allowed the match to be waived.\nFrom 2020 to 2021, the following events took place:\n\nNoem supported the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in August 2020, despite warnings from experts that it could spread COVID-19. Nearly 500,000 bikers attended the event. Public health notices were issued for saloons and other businesses in the Sturgis area. By the end of August, dozens of cases linked to attendance at the event were reported in several states.\nIn September 2020, amid a surge of new cases, Noem announced that she would spend $5 million of relief funding on a state tourism campaign. She used $819,000 of those funds to have the state's Department of Tourism run a 30-second Fox News commercial she had narrated during the 2020 Republican National Convention.\nDuring September 2020, over 550 students became infected at South Dakota universities; 200 more cases were reported in K–12 schools.\nIn October 2020, as South Dakota reported the country's second-highest number of new COVID-19 cases per capita and hospitals began to prioritize treatment of severe COVID-19 cases over lesser ones, Noem said the higher case numbers were because of more testing, despite the positive test rate and hospitalization rate also increasing.\nIn February 2021, Noem signed a bill limiting civil liability for certain exposures to COVID-19. The bill exempted healthcare providers and other businesses, including those selling personal protective equipment, from lawsuits unless COVID-19 exposure resulted from gross negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct.\nAlso in February 2021, Noem announced her opposition to a bill prohibiting schools and universities from requiring students to get vaccinated. In May, she signed an executive order prohibiting government facilities from requiring proof of vaccination to access services, a policy she called \"un-American\". In August, Noem opposed legislation proposed by Republican state legislators Jon Hansen and Scott Odenbach that would prohibit businesses from requiring vaccinations as a condition for employment.\nIn July 2021, Noem criticized other Republican governors for enacting mandatory measures against COVID-19 and trying to \"rewrite history\" about it. She argued that South Dakota had effectively combated the pandemic by instead testing and isolating cases. South Dakota had the 10th-highest death rate and third-highest case rate at that time.\n\n\n==== Department of Corrections ====\nIn July 2021, Noem placed Secretary of the Department of Corrections Mike Liedholt on administrative leave, and fired South Dakota State Penitentiary Warden Darin Young and Deputy Warden Jennifer Dreiske, after receiving an anonymous note with complaints regarding pay, medical coverage and instances of sexual harassment. Liedholt later announced his retirement. Later that month, after meeting with prison employees, despite lingering COVID-19 cases, Noem ended the prison's mask mandate.\nIn August 2021, Noem announced that the CGL Group, a California-based company, was hired for $166,410 to comprehensively review the Department of Corrections operations. At the same time, the director of the prison work program was fired, and two other DOC employees relieved of their duties.\nThe prison work program director, Stephany Bawek, subsequently filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that she was retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment by Young. On March 14, 2022, Bawek filed a lawsuit in federal district court alleging that she was fired for reporting incidents of sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n\n==== Deployment of South Dakota National Guard to southern border (2021) ====\nIn June 2021, Noem announced that she was sending members of the South Dakota National Guard to Texas's border with Mexico. Tennessee billionaire Willis Johnson said he would donate the money necessary for the deployment. On September 22, 2021, the Center for Public Integrity sued the South Dakota National Guard and the U.S. Department of Defense in the federal district court in the District of Columbia to obtain documents about the deployment and the donation. The 2022 National Defense Authorization Act banned National Guard members from crossing state borders to perform duties paid for by private donors.\n\n\n==== Fireworks at Mount Rushmore lawsuit (2021) ====\nIn 2021, Noem sued U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, seeking to have fireworks at Mount Rushmore for Independence Day. Fireworks displays had been halted at the site in 2009 by the National Park Service due to fire risks and other reasons. Noem hired the private Washington D.C. law firm Consovoy McCarthy to bring the case, with South Dakota state taxpayer money paying for the suit. The U.S. District Court dismissed the suit, with Judge Roberto Lange finding that four of the five reasons given by the NPS and Secretary Haaland were valid. On July 13, Noem filed an appeal with the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.\nOn March 14, 2022, the National Park Service again denied Noem's application for a permit to have fireworks at Mount Rushmore for the 4th of July, citing opposition from Native American groups and the possibility of wildfires.\n\n\n==== Governor's mansion spending ====\nIn May 2019, Noem proposed to build a fence around the governor's mansion, estimated to cost approximately $400,000, but retracted the proposal. In 2020, the 2019 project was revived; a senior Noem advisor told the media that the decision was based on the recommendations of Noem's security team. In late November 2021, it was reported that Noem spent $68,000 of taxpayer dollars on imported rugs from India, chandeliers and a sauna for the mansion.\n\n\n==== Guns ====\n\nIn 2019, Noem signed a bill into law abolishing South Dakota's permit requirement to carry a concealed handgun. In 2022, she sought to build a gun range in Meade County with government funds, but the legislature rejected it.\nAt a 2023 NRA forum in Indiana, Noem said that her two-year-old granddaughter had a shotgun, a rifle, and a \"little pony named Sparkles\".\n\n\n==== LGBTQ rights ====\nNoem opposes same-sex marriage. In 2015, she said she disagreed with Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court's ruling that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional.\nOn March 8, 2021, Noem announced on Twitter that she would sign into law H.B. 1217, the Women's Fairness in Sports Bill, which bans transgender athletes from playing on or against women's school and college sports teams. Some critics of the bill said they were worried it might turn away business and cost the state money. On March 19, Noem issued a style and form veto to H.B. 1217 that substantially altered the bill, not just correcting grammar and spelling mistakes. She defended her position on Tucker Carlson Tonight.\nOn March 29, the South Dakota House rejected Noem's veto, 67–2. The bill was returned to Noem for reconsideration, and she vetoed it again. The House failed to override her veto, by a vote of 45–24. 47 votes were needed to override. Many conservative commentators criticized Noem for vetoing the bill.\nIn December 2021, Noem and her office signaled their support for a bill called \"An Act to Protect Fairness in women's sports.\" The bill would require young athletes to join teams that align with their sex assigned at birth.\nIn 2021, Noem signed a religious refusal bill into law. The legislation amended the state RFRA to allow business owners to cite religious beliefs as a basis to deny products or services to people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The legislation, S.B. 124, was criticized by civil rights groups who said it would enable discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, women, and members of minority faiths. This bill was the first major state RFRA law signed into law in six years, and resembles the 2015 bill signed into law by Indiana Governor Mike Pence.\n\n\n==== \"Meth. We're on It\" campaign ====\nOn November 18, 2019, Noem released a meth awareness campaign named \"Meth. We're on It\". The campaign was widely mocked and Noem was criticized for spending $449,000 of public funds while hiring an out-of-state advertising agency from Minnesota to lead the project. She defended the campaign as successful in raising awareness.\n\n\n==== Opposition to cannabis legalization ====\nIn 2020, Noem opposed two ballot measures to legalize cannabis for medical use and recreational use in South Dakota, saying, \"The fact is, I've never met someone who got smarter from smoking pot. It's not good for our kids. And it's not going to improve our communities.\" After both measures passed, she and two police officers filed a lawsuit seeking a court decision against the measure legalizing recreational use, Amendment A.\nOn February 8, 2021, circuit court judge Christina Klinger struck down the amendment as unconstitutional. After the ruling, she also sought to delay the implementation of the medical marijuana initiative for a year. Ultimately, her efforts failed and medical marijuana became legal on July 1, 2021.\nNoem has opposed the cultivation of industrial hemp, vetoing a bill that passed the South Dakota House and Senate in 2019 to legalize hemp cultivation. She said, \"There is no question in my mind that normalizing hemp, like legalizing medical marijuana, is part of a larger strategy to undermine enforcement of the drug laws and make legalized marijuana inevitable.\"\n\n\n==== RV Park in Custer State Park proposal ====\nIn 2022, Noem sought to locate a government-paid RV park in Custer State Park. The proposal was met with significant opposition to include government competing with private business and disturbing the pristine nature of the park. The House Agricultural and Natural Resources deferred the bill to the 41st day, effectively killing it, by a vote of 9–3.\n\n\n==== School prayer bill ====\nIn 2022, Noem sought to have prayer put back in school after mentioning it in a speech in Iowa. On January 21, 2022, the \"prayer bill\", HB 1015, was defeated in the House Education Committee by a vote of 9–6. An aide to Noem admitted to the committee that no schools were consulted about the proposal.\n\n\n==== Staff ====\nOn November 19, 2021, Noem named her fifth chief of staff, Mark Miller, to replace outgoing chief of staff Aaron Scheibe. Scheibe served as chief of staff from May 1 to November 19, 2021. Tony Venhuizen preceded Scheibe from March 2, 2020, to April 23, 2021. Josh Shields preceded Venhuizen from October 1, 2019, to January 1, 2020. Herb Jones was Noem's first chief of staff, and served from January 5 to October 1, 2019.\n\n\n==== Trade ====\nIn February 2019, she said that the Trump administration's trade wars with China and the European Union had devastated South Dakota's economy, particularly the agricultural sector, \"by far\" the state's largest industry.\n\n\n==== Supplemental Income from Political Donations ====\nIn 2023, while serving as South Dakota's governor, Noem funneled $80,000 in fees from a nonprofit, American Resolve Policy Fund, into her personal company. She failed to disclose this payment in her federal ethics filings upon joining DHS, which ethics experts say violates disclosure rules.\n\n\n== Secretary of Homeland Security (2025–present) ==\n\n\n=== Nomination and confirmation ===\nOn November 12, 2024, President-elect Trump selected Noem to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security in his second term. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a confirmation hearing for her on January 17, 2025. The committee advanced her nomination in a 13–2 vote on January 20. On January 25, the Senate confirmed Noem by a vote of 59–34, with seven Democrats voting to confirm.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\n\nAfter resigning as governor of South Dakota, Noem was sworn in on January 25, 2025, by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as Secretary of Homeland Security, with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry holding the Bible.\nIn the early morning of January 28, Noem joined multiple federal law enforcement agencies, including ICE, to lead a raid on illegal immigrants in New York City. Her department posted a video of the raid on X that showed an apparent arrest.\nAfter the 2025 Potomac River mid-air collision, Noem deployed U.S. Coast Guard resources for search and rescue efforts.\n\nOne of Noem's first acts in office was to rescind an 18-month extension of temporary protected status for about 600,000 Venezuelans who had fled Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime. In March, she revoked legal protections for 532,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who had settled in the U.S. since 2022.\nIn February, CNN host Dana Bash interviewed Noem about the new administration's policies and the Department of Homeland Security, including the use of Guantanamo Bay to detain migrants, which Noem said would be temporary. Noem also told Bash that she was comfortable with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) having access to sensitive data, saying that it was identifying waste, fraud, and abuse. She added, \"information he [Elon Musk] has is looking at programs, not focusing on personal data and information.\"\nIn April, The Washington Post reported that Noem and acting Social Security Administration commissioner Leland Dudek had instructed the Social Security Administration to falsely list over 6,000 living immigrants in its database of dead people.\nOn the evening of April 20, Noem's purse was stolen from a D.C. burger restaurant. The purse contained important items, like her government access badge, apartment keys, $2,000–3,000 in cash, her passport, and blank checks. The incident raised various concerns, including about her Secret Service detail presence.\nThe Trump administration has claimed that around 140,000 people had been deported as of April 2025, though some estimates put the number at roughly half that.\nDuring a May 20 Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the Department of Homeland Security's budget for fiscal year 2026, Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus as \"a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country\" in response to a question from Senator Maggie Hassan. In actuality, habeas corpus is the constitutional right for a detainee to request that a court review the lawfulness of their detention, which would require the government to justify the detention. After being corrected on the definition, Noem said that the American president \"has the authority under the Constitution to\" choose to suspend habeas corpus. In fact, the constitutional clause on the suspension of habeas corpus, which reads \"Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it\", is in Article One of the United States Constitution on the powers of Congress, not Article Two of the United States Constitution on the powers of the executive branch.\n\nOn May 22, Noem attempted to revoke the Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification for Harvard University (see Education policy of the second Donald Trump administration).\nDuring a news conference in Los Angeles on June 12, Noem failed to recognize the senior U.S. Senator from California, Alex Padilla, who was present at the news conference. When Padilla attempted to ask Noem a question he pushed in front of reporters and acted agitated, he was forcibly removed from the room, pushed to the ground, and handcuffed by FBI and Secret Service agents.\nIn June 2025, ProPublica reported that Noem failed to disclose past income from a dark money group in her federal ethics filings upon joining DHS, which ethics experts say violates disclosure rules.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== Presidential politics ==\n\n\n=== 2020 presidential election ===\nIn 2020, the Trump-Pence ticket carried South Dakota, receiving 261,043 votes to 150,471 for the Biden-Harris ticket.  Noem was initially designated to be one of Trump's three presidential electors for South Dakota, but later withdrew.\nNoem has claimed that the 2020 presidential election, in which Biden defeated Trump, was marred by widespread voter fraud; no evidence supports this claim. On December 8, 2020, Noem tacitly acknowledged the outcome of the election when she referred to a \"Biden administration\" during her annual state budget address, but even after Biden was inaugurated in January, she still refused to accept that the election was \"free and fair\".\nAfter the U.S. Capitol was attacked by a pro-Trump mob on January 6, 2021, disrupting the counting of the electoral votes formalizing Biden's victory, Noem spoke out against the violence, saying: \"We are all entitled to peacefully protest. Violence is not a part of that.\" One day after calling for peace and reconciliation in the aftermath of the assault on the Capitol, Noem called the two newly elected Democratic senators from Georgia, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, \"communists\" in an op-ed for The Federalist, prompting criticism from South Dakota Democrats.\n\n\n=== 2024 presidential election ===\nNoem endorsed Trump in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries in September 2023, at a rally hosted for him in Rapid City, South Dakota. Trump invited her to appear with him at a March 2024 rally in Vandalia, Ohio.\nDuring Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, commentators suggested that Noem was a potential running mate for Trump. In September 2023, when asked on Newsmax if she would agree to serve as Trump's running mate, Noem responded that she would \"in a heartbeat\". At the February 2024 CPAC conference, Noem tied with Vivek Ramaswamy as attendees' top choice for Trump's running mate, with each receiving 15% of the vote in a straw poll. Also that month, Trump acknowledged that Noem was one of the names on his shortlist to be his running mate. In March 2024, CNN reported that Noem was one of four people Trump had shown increased interest in selecting as his running mate.\nIn April 2024, insiders said that her odds of being selected as Trump's running mate had waned due to her stance on abortion and the revelation in her book No Going Back that she shot and killed her pet dog and a goat. It was noted that \"additions, subtractions and the emergence of dark-horse candidates remain possible\", but on June 5, NBC News reported that Noem was no longer on Trump's shortlist of running mates.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe married Bryon Noem in 1992, in Watertown, South Dakota. They have three children. In 2011, when Noem moved to Washington to take her congressional office, her family continued to live on a ranch near Castlewood, South Dakota.\nNoem is a Protestant. As of 2018, her family attended a Foursquare Church in Watertown, South Dakota. She is a grandmother.\nIn September 2021, conservative media outlet American Greatness reported that Noem was having an extramarital affair with political operative Corey Lewandowski. Noem called the report a \"disgusting lie\", saying, \"these old, tired attacks on conservative women are based on a falsehood that we can't achieve anything without a man's help.\" In September 2023, the New York Post and the Daily Mail published similar reports about Noem and Lewandowski, which Noem's spokesman denied.\nIn March 2024, Noem shared a video in which she identified herself as the South Dakota governor and promoted a cosmetic dentist business that she said helped her after she lost her front teeth in a biking accident years before: \"I love my new family at Smile Texas!\" Noem has since become one of the most prominent examples of so-called \"Mar-a-Lago face\", a cosmetic surgery trend among conservative women.\nIn August 2024, Noem and her sister were inducted into the Daughters of the American Revolution at the South Dakota State Fair.\n\n\n=== No Going Back ===\nIn April 2024, pre-release excerpts of Noem's second autobiography, No Going Back, received broad criticism and condemnation. In a chapter titled \"Bad Day to Be a Goat\", Noem recounts that she brought her family's 14-month-old female wirehaired pointer, Cricket, along for a pheasant hunt with guests at her family's hunting lodge. Expecting Cricket to emulate the older, trained, dogs on the hunt, Noem instead felt that Cricket ruined the hunt by \"chasing all those birds and having the time of her life\". After the dog killed several chickens on the same day, Noem decided Cricket was \"dangerous\" and \"untrainable\", and shot the dog dead in a gravel pit. Noem then killed her family's male goat, which she said was \"disgusting, musky, rancid\".\nNoem initially responded that \"tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm\", and subsequently said the incident occurred 20 years ago, and that \"the fake news ... put the worst spin\" on the story, as Cricket was a \"working dog\" that \"came to us from a family who had found her way too aggressive ... a responsible owner does what they need to do\". The story led to bipartisan criticism of Noem and doubt about the likelihood of her selection as Trump's vice presidential running mate intensified. A fundraising dinner for Noem in Colorado scheduled for May 4 was canceled after the group and the hotel hosting the event received death threats.\nLater in the memoir, Noem wrote of imagining herself becoming president in 2025, taking over from Biden, and that the first thing she would do would be to \"make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds ('Commander, say hello to Cricket for me')\", in an apparent suggestion that Commander be killed. Months earlier, Commander had been moved out of the White House after having bitten Secret Service agents and others on over a dozen occasions. In an interview, Noem said that Biden was \"accountable\" and called for Biden to \"make a decision\" on \"what to do\" about Commander.\nNoem also wrote that she met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Her spokesperson said the claim was an error and would be expunged from the book's future editions. Separately, Noem claimed in the book that she was once \"slated to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron\", but called off the meeting because he made a \"very pro-Hamas and anti-Israel comment to the press\"; the French government responded that it had neither invited Noem nor had any record of a scheduled meeting with her.\nThe Washington Post's literary critic Ron Charles wrote that the \"description of Cricket's Last Stand is the one time in this howlingly dull book that Noem demonstrates any sense of setting, character, plot and emotional honesty. Otherwise, it's mostly a hodgepodge of worn chestnuts and conservative maxims\".\n\n\n=== Health ===\nOn June 17, 2025, Noem was hospitalized for an unspecified allergic reaction. She was released that night.\n\n\n== Autobiographies ==\nNoem, Kristi (2022). Not My First Rodeo. New York: Twelve. ISBN 978-1538707050.\nNoem, Kristi (2024). No Going Back. Nashville: Center Street.

        "title": "Son Heung-min",
        "content": "Son Heung-min (Korean: 손흥민; pronounced [son.ɣɯŋ.min]; born 8 July 1992) is a South Korean professional footballer who plays as a forward for Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC and captains the South Korea national team. Known for his speed, finishing, two-footedness, and ability to link play, he is the top Asian goalscorer in both Premier League and UEFA Champions League history, and is widely regarded as the greatest Asian player of all time.\nBorn in Chuncheon, South Korea, Son relocated to Germany to join Hamburger SV at 16, making his debut in the Bundesliga in 2010. In 2013, he moved to Bayer Leverkusen for a club record €10 million before signing for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur two years later. While at Spurs, Son soon established himself as one of the best forwards in the world. He contributed to the club reaching the Champions League final in 2018–19 and the EFL Cup final in 2020–21. In 2019–20, Son scored a solo effort in the league that earned him the FIFA Puskás Award. In the 2021–22 season, he jointly won the Premier League Golden Boot award with 23 goals, becoming the first Asian player to win it. In April 2023, he became the first Asian player to score 100 Premier League goals. Appointed club captain later in 2023, he led Spurs to the UEFA Europa League title, his first major honour, in 2025, his final season, while also ending a 17-year trophy drought for the club.\nA full international since 2010, Son has represented South Korea at the 2014, 2018, and 2022 FIFA World Cups and is his country's joint top scorer at World Cups, tied with Park Ji-sung and Ahn Jung-hwan on three goals. Son has also represented South Korea at the 2018 Asian Games, where the team won gold, and the 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2023 editions of the AFC Asian Cup; Korea was the runner-up in 2015.\nOutside of football, Son is viewed as a symbol of national pride in South Korea for his achievements, and has been listed in Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 since 2019, where he ranked second in 2024. In June 2022, Son received the Order of Sport Merit, Cheongnyong class, the highest order of merit for achievement in sports given to a South Korean citizen, for his achievements in football. Son has been credited for having raised the profile of Spurs among South Koreans, with the club's marketing and social media strategy catering extensively to Korean supporters.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSon Heung-min was born in Chuncheon, South Korea. He is of the Miryang Son clan. His father, Son Woong-jung, is a retired footballer turned manager who once played for the South Korea national B team.\nSon came through the academy at FC Seoul, the same club that former Spurs defender Lee Young-pyo played for. Son was a ball boy in an FC Seoul home match in 2008 when he was a FC Seoul youth player. At that time, his role model was midfielder Lee Chung-yong, who played for Crystal Palace and Bolton Wanderers. Apart from his native language Korean, Son is also fluent in German and English. His agent Thies Bliemeister said Son was so determined to make himself a success in Europe that he learned German by watching episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Hamburger SV ===\nIn August 2008, Son dropped out of Dongbuk High School's football club (formerly FC Seoul under-18 team) and joined Hamburger SV's youth academy at age 16 through Korean FA Youth Project. A year later, he returned to South Korea. After participating in the FIFA U-17 World Cup, he formally joined Hamburger SV's youth academy in November 2009.\n\nHe was impressive in the 2010–11 pre-season, leading the team with nine goals, and signed his first professional contract on his 18th birthday. After scoring against Chelsea in August, he was out for two months due to a foot injury. He returned on 30 October 2010 to score his first league goal, against 1. FC Köln in the 24th minute. The goal made Son the youngest Hamburg player to score a goal in the Bundesliga at 18, breaking the record held by Manfred Kaltz.\nSon signed a new deal with Hamburg through 2014. Pundits said he had what it took to become the next Cha Bum-kun, a legendary Bundesliga forward and fellow South Korean. Son scored three goals in 14 matches in all competition during the 2010–11 season.\nDuring the 2011–12 pre-season, Son was explosive, scoring 18 times in only nine matches. After missing the opening match due to a fever, Son scored two goals within three matches. On 27 August, Son picked up an ankle injury in the 4–3 loss to 1. FC Köln and was initially projected to be out of action for four to six weeks. His recovery was quicker than expected and he returned to action only three weeks later as a substitute in a 1–0 loss against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 17 September. Over the course of the 2011–12 season, he made 30 appearances for Hamburg and scored five goals, including crucial goals against Hannover 96 and 1. FC Nürnberg at the end of the season to help ensure that Hamburg remained in the Bundesliga.\nFollowing Hamburger SV's 2012–13 offseason moves, which saw the transfers of the team's strikers Mladen Petrić and Paolo Guerrero to Fulham and Corinthians respectively, manager Thorsten Fink chose to name Son a starter. The 2012–13 season was a breakthrough season for Son as he scored two goals in an away fixture against Borussia Dortmund on 9 February 2013, helping his team to a 4–1 victory. Son was chosen Mann des Tages (Man of the Match) by kicker. On 14 April, Son netted two goals in a 2–1 win against Mainz 05. He finished the season with 12 goals, becoming the fifth South Korean footballer to achieve double digits in goals in Europe. He finished the 2012–13 season with 12 goals in 34 matches in all competitions.\n\n\n=== Bayer Leverkusen ===\n\nOn 13 June 2013, Bayer Leverkusen confirmed Son's transfer for reportedly €10 million, which was the highest transfer fee in the club's history at the time. He agreed to a five-year deal with the team. Son adjusted quickly to his new club in the pre-season, scoring three goals in his first three appearances for the team in exhibition matches (against 1860 Munich, Udinese and KAS Eupen respectively).\nOn 9 November 2013, Son scored a hat-trick for Leverkusen in a 5–3 win against his former club Hamburger SV. On 7 December, Son scored a crucial goal against Borussia Dortmund to put his club just four points off the summit of the Bundesliga. On 10 May 2014, Son scored another goal against Werder Bremen ensuring his team a spot for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. He finished the 2013–14 season with 12 goals in 43 matches.\nSon scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg on 14 February 2015, in a 4–5 defeat, scoring when they were losing 0–3. He finished the 2014–15 season with 17 goals in 42 matches.\nSon started the 2015–16 season with Bayer Leverkusen. He made a league appearance and a Champions League qualifying match.\n\n\n=== Tottenham Hotspur ===\n\n\n==== 2015–16: Debut season ====\nOn 28 August 2015, Son joined Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for £22 million (€30 million) on a five-year contract, subject to work permit and international clearance. Upon his signing, he became the most expensive Asian player in football history. The record had been held since 2001 by Japanese Hidetoshi Nakata, who transferred from Roma to Parma for €25 million.\nSon made his debut on 13 September away to Sunderland, being replaced by Andros Townsend in the 62nd minute of a 1–0 win. In Tottenham's first match of the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League on 17 September, Son netted his first two goals for the club in a 3–1 win against Qarabağ FK. Three days later, he scored his first Premier League goal, against Crystal Palace at White Hart Lane, netting in the 68th minute to give Tottenham their first home Premier League win of the season. On 28 December in the match against Watford, Son replaced Tom Carroll in the 80th minute and scored Tottenham's winning goal in the 89th minute. On 2 May, he scored the second goal against Chelsea in a crucial match to give Spurs hope of winning the Premier League. Chelsea equalised in the second half, however, handing over the title to Leicester City.\n\n\n==== 2016–2018: Breakthrough and Premier League runner-up ====\n\nBefore the season, he reportedly asked Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino for permission to leave Tottenham in an attempt to get more playing time, but was instead given a chance to fight for his place at Spurs. On 10 September 2016, Son scored two goals and created a third in his first appearance of the season, in a 4–0 win against Stoke City. Son followed that performance up with a second brace, coming at Middlesbrough on 24 September, earning his team a 1–2 victory. Upon equalling his league goal total from the previous season in 25 fewer matches, Son was hailed by Pochettino as \"a different person – he's more mature and he knows the league and he's settled in fantastically now.\" Son continued his excellent run of form with his fifth goal in five matches on 27 September in the Champions League. Playing at CSKA Moscow, Son slipped a shot past goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev for the only goal of the match. On 14 October, Son was named the Premier League Player of the Month for September, being the first South Korean and first Asian to receive the award.\nFollowing the Christmas break Son continued to score the odd goal over the following couple of months and then on 12 March 2017 he scored his first Spurs hat trick in the FA Cup against Millwall in a 6–0 win. In the same match, he was racially abused by a section of the Millwall fans who chanted \"DVD\" and \"he's selling three for a fiver\" whenever he touched the ball, referencing a stereotype towards east Asians. He scored in the 2–0 victory away at Burnley on 1 April 2017, and four days later he scored in the 91st minute to put Spurs ahead at Swansea, in a game where they were losing 1–0 after 88 minutes and ended up winning 3–1. A brace at home to Watford the following weekend brought his season total to 18 goals, 11 in the Premier League, his best ever goals return. On 12 May 2017, Tottenham announced that Son had won the Premier League Player of the Month for April, the second time of his career and thus becoming the only player in 2016–17 to win the award 2 times. On 18 May 2017, Son bagged a brace away to Leicester City as part of a 6–1 rout of their former title rivals. With 21 goals in all competitions, Son joined Harry Kane and Dele Alli as the first trio of Spurs players with over 20 goals on the season.\n\nSon scored his first goal of the 2017–18 season in the UEFA Champions League game against Borussia Dortmund on 13 September 2017 at Spurs temporary home Wembley Stadium, which Spurs won 3–1. He scored his first Premier League goal in the season when Spurs beat Liverpool 4–1 at home. On 5 November 2017, Son scored the only goal in the 1–0 win against Crystal Palace. The goal brought his tally in the Premier League to 20 and in doing so he became the top Asian goalscorer in Premier League history, breaking the record set by Park Ji-Sung at Manchester United. On 13 January 2018, Son scored a goal and provided an assist in a game against Everton, matching the club record set in 2004 by Jermain Defoe of scoring in five consecutive home games. On 28 February 2018, Son scored a brace and assisted Fernando Llorente as Tottenham beat Rochdale 6–1 in the fifth round of the FA Cup. Son also converted a penalty, but his goal was overruled by the video assistant referee. Son has become the first Asian to finish the season as a top-10 goal scorer in the English Premier League.\n\n\n==== 2018–19: Champions League runner-up ====\nOn 20 July 2018, Son signed a new five-year deal extending his contract with Tottenham until 2023. The first goals of the season came in October 2018 when he scored a brace in his 150th game for Tottenham in the 2018–19 EFL Cup match against West Ham. He scored his first league goal in the season, his 50th goal for the club in all competitions, in a solo effort in the 3–1 home win against Chelsea, inflicting the first defeat for Chelsea in the Premier League this season. This goal won the Premier League's Goal of the Month award for November. On 13 February 2019, Son scored the first goal in a 3–0 win over Borussia Dortmund, in the first leg of the round of 16, UEFA Champions League. At the end of the month he was named Premier League Player of the Year at the London Football Awards. On 3 April 2019, Son scored the first professional goal at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a 2–0 victory over Crystal Palace.\nOn 9 April 2019, Son scored the first European competition goal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a 1–0 win against Manchester City in the quarterfinals of the 2018–19 Champions League. In the return leg, Son scored twice to earn Tottenham a 4–4 aggregate win on the away goals rule and help the club reach the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 1962, and only the second time ever. His brace also saw him become the highest scoring Asian player in the history of the tournament with 12 goals, overtaking the previous record holder, Maxim Shatskikh. On 4 May 2019, Son received his first red card in the Premier League due to his vindictive action against Jefferson Lerma.\n\n\n==== 2019–20: Puskás Award ====\nSon opened his 2019–20 account on 14 September 2019 by scoring two goals against Crystal Palace in the Premier League with a final result of 4–0. On 21 October, Son was named in the 30-man shortlist for the 2019 Ballon d'Or. On 3 November, Son was sent off during a 1–1 draw with Everton after sliding into André Gomes from behind, causing him to fall awkwardly and suffer a severe ankle injury. The injury prompted great concern and anguish from the players and supporters; Son was visibly highly distressed by the incident. Following a red card for a challenge on Gomes, Son also received suspension for three Premier League games. However, many professionals including former Everton player Kevin Kilbane expressed criticism of the red card decision, and Tottenham made an appeal to the Football Association against the dismissal. The FA accepted the appeal and Son's red card was rescinded on 5 November. Three days after this incident, in a 4–0 Champions League away game to Red Star Belgrade, in which Son scored a brace, rather than celebrating his first goal, he apologised to the camera for what happened at Goodison Park.\nOn 23 November 2019, Son scored Tottenham's first goal with José Mourinho as manager, earning him Man-of-the-match in a 3–2 Spurs victory against West Ham. On 7 December, in the match against Burnley, Son ran from one end of the pitch to the other, going past seven Burnley players, to score an individual goal that was immediately labelled a goal of the season contender. The nature of the goal saw Mourinho dub him \"Sonaldo Nazario\" in reference to the type of goal former Brazilian international Ronaldo would score. In January 2020, Son was awarded the Premier League goal of the month for December for his goal against Burnley, eventually winning him the Goal of the Season award. The goal was further recognised by FIFA with a Puskás Award as the best goal of the past 12 months in December 2020.\nOn 22 December 2019, facing Chelsea, Son was sent off after raising his boot against Antonio Rüdiger's ribs. On 16 February 2020, Son scored two goals at Villa Park and earned a 3–2 victory for Tottenham, in which he became the first Asian footballer to score 50 goals in the Premier League, with 51 scored goals in 151 Premier League matches. Son played the full game despite suffering a fracture to his arm at the 31st second of the game. Head coach José Mourinho declared at a later stage that he was not optimistic regarding Son's injury and that it was likely that the South Korean would be sidelined for the rest of the season.\nOn 6 April 2020, while football was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, it was confirmed that Son would carry out his mandatory military service for South Korea. After completing a two-week quarantine on his return to Korea, he served with the Marine Corps for three weeks on Jeju Island.\n\n\n==== 2020–21: PFA Team of the Year ====\n\nIn the second Premier League match of the 2020–21 season, Son scored four goals, all assisted by Harry Kane, in a 5–2 win against Southampton and the first League win and away win of the season. This was the first time in Premier League history in which a single player scored four goals in a match while being assisted by the same teammate.  In the Premier League game on 4 October, he scored a brace against Manchester United to help Tottenham win 6–1, which is the biggest win for Tottenham at Old Trafford and their best result against United since a home win in 1932. Based on his performances, Son received his third Premier League Player of the Month award on 13 November 2020.\nOn 28 January 2021, Son's counterpart on the Korean Women's National Team, Cho So-hyun joined FA WSL side Tottenham Hotspur on loan for the remainder of the 2020–21 season. With Son already at the club it gave Spurs the rare distinction of having both the Men's and Women's Korean National Team Captains at one club.\nOn 2 January 2021, Son scored his 100th goal for Tottenham in the 3–0 win against Leeds. On 10 February 2021, he provided three assists, but Tottenham lost 5–4 to Everton in the FA Cup. On 7 March, Son provided an assist to Harry Kane in a 4–1 win against Crystal Palace, and this, their 14th combined goal effort whereby one assisted another, set a record for the most goal combinations in a single Premier League season. After the end of the season, he and Kane were selected for the PFA Premier League Team of the Year, although Tottenham finished in seventh place.\n\n\n==== 2021–22: Premier League Golden Boot ====\nOn 23 July 2021, Son extended his contract with Tottenham until 2025. On 15 August, he scored his first goal of the season in the opening match against Manchester City, which ended in a 1–0 win. On 4 November, he scored in new manager Antonio Conte's first match in charge, a 3–2 victory over Vitesse in the group stage of the Europa Conference League. In doing so, Son had the distinction of scoring the first goal under each of Tottenham's last three permanent managers.  On 26 February, Son scored a goal against Leeds United in a 4–0 win; the goal was assisted by Harry Kane meaning this was the 37th time Kane and Son had combined to score, which set a new record in goal-scoring partnerships in the Premier League.\nOn 9 April, Son scored a hat-trick against Aston Villa to give Spurs a 4–0 away win at Villa Park, and also break into Tottenham Hotspur all-time top 10 goalscoring list. Son scored twice in a 5–0 win against Norwich City on the last day of the season securing a Champions League qualification for Tottenham, after finishing in fourth place in the Premier League, while also winning the Premier League Golden Boot alongside Mohamed Salah with 23 goals, becoming the first Asian player to do so.\n\n\n==== 2022–23: 100th Premier League goal ====\nAfter winning the Golden Boot the previous season, Son had a poor start to the 2022–23 season, failing to score any goal in the first eight games and proving only one assist. He ended his goal drought in the game against Leicester City on 17 September, when he came off the bench to score a hat-trick in 13 minutes to help Tottenham win 6–2. On 1 November, Son collided with Marseille's Chancel Mbemba during the final matchday of the UEFA Champions League group stage, which caused an orbital fracture in his left eye. Son managed to recover enough to play in the 2022 World Cup for South Korea, wearing a protective mask in all his matches.\nOn 19 February 2023, after scoring a 72nd-minute goal against West Ham to secure a 2–0 victory, Son was subjected to online racist abuse, which was condemned as \"utterly reprehensible\" by Tottenham and the Kick It Out anti-racism organisation. Despite enduring a difficult season for Tottenham, on 8 April, Son scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 2–1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion, and became the first Asian player to reach that landmark.\nThe day after Tottenham's last league game of the season against Leeds United, on 29 May, Son underwent an operation to treat a hernia issue. In an interview with TV Chosun, Son revealed that he carried the injury with him for 8–9 months, which allowed him to play only at 60% of his normal ability for much of the season.\n\n\n==== 2023–2025: Captaincy and Europa League victory ====\n\nOn 12 August 2023, it was announced that Son had been made Tottenham's new captain, replacing Hugo Lloris. On 2 September, he scored his first hat-trick as club's captain in a 5–2 away win over Burnley. On 24 September, he scored two equalisers as Spurs drew 2–2 away against Arsenal in the North London derby, becoming the sixth player in the club's history to score 150 goals, after netting his 149th and 150th goals in the derby. Following the match, Son earned the praise of his manager Ange Postecoglou, stating that \"he's been outstanding as a leader and as a player [...] we have put him in that nine position now and he just works so hard. He is so team-first orientated, it is incredible\". He scored the opening goal against Liverpool on 1 October in a 2–1 victory at home, in Spurs' first victory against them in five years. This was his 200th professional goal in all competitions across top-division European football. For his six goals in four games in September, he was later named Premier League Player of the Month, his fourth time receiving the award. He had a goal and two assists in a 4–1 victory over Newcastle United on 10 December, becoming Tottenham's all-time assist leader in the Premier League with 83 assists.\nOn 10 February 2024, Son made his return from the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, assisting teammate Brennan Johnson to score a 90+6th-minute goal, a late minute winner in a 2–1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion. This prompted Postecoglou to hail him as \"the best attacking player in the competition\". On 19 December, Son scored directly from a corner in a 4–3 win over Manchester United in the EFL Cup quarter-finals.\nOn 7 January 2025, Tottenham announced they had exercised their option to extend Son’s contract by an additional 12 months until June 2026.\nOn 21 May 2025, Son lifted the UEFA Europa League trophy after playing as a substitute at the 2025 UEFA Europa League final which ended in a 1–0 win over Manchester United. The Europa League title was Tottenham's first title since the 2007–08 Football League Cup and Son's first title in his professional career. \nOn 1 August, in a pre-season press conference in Seoul, Son announced that he was set to depart Tottenham before the beginning of the season. Son's final appearance for the club came the following day in a friendly against Newcastle United in the Seoul World Cup Stadium; when Son was substituted off in the 67th minute, players from both sides formed an impromptu guard of honour.\n\n\n=== Los Angeles FC ===\nOn 6 August 2025, Son moved to Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC in a deal worth $26.5 million, an MLS record, departing Tottenham Hotspur after 10 years. He became just the second South Korean player in the club's history, the other being Kim Moon-hwan. On 23 August, Son scored his first goal for LAFC by converting a free kick in a 1–1 draw with FC Dallas.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== 2009–2014: Youth level and first major tournaments ===\nSon was a member of the South Korea national team that participated at the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup held in Nigeria. He scored 3 goals in this tournament.\nOn 24 December 2010, Son was named in South Korea national team's squad for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, making his debut for the national team in a pre-tournament friendly against Syria on 30 December. At the tournament finals, Son scored his first international goal during a 4–1 group stage win against India. This goal made him the youngest goalscorer in the AFC Asian Cup history.\nOn 7 October 2011, after initially missing the first two matches of South Korea's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign on 2 and 6 September 2011 due to an ankle injury, Son played in a friendly against Poland, and was again featured in 11 October World Cup qualifier against the United Arab Emirates. His selection for national team play was a point of concern for Son's father, however, who caused a stir by asking the Korea Football Association not to select his son for the national team in the immediate future so he can rest and mature more as a player. Cho Kwang-rae, then the South Korea head coach, responded by saying that he would continue to call up Son when needed.\n\nSon turned down the opportunity to participate in the 2012 London Olympics, opting to concentrate on his club career at Hamburger SV. Son was quoted as saying, \"In Korea, an Olympic appearance has a special meaning, but I want to speed up for Hamburg. What matters is to pour all my time into team training.\" Son did, however, play for the national team in the autumn of 2012 for two 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Lebanon and Iran, and became a regular call-up in friendlies and World Cup qualifying matches in 2013. In the World Cup qualifier against Qatar on 23 March 2013, Son came on as a substitute in the 81st minute and scored the winning goal in the 96th minute.\nIn June 2014, Son was named in South Korea's squad for the 2014 World Cup. On 22 June, he scored in a 4–2 defeat to Algeria in the team's second group match. The Korea Football Association requested Bayer Leverkusen to allow Son to play in the 2014 Asian Games, as winning the gold medal at the tournament would grant Son exemption from military service. Despite Son affirming his interest and the KFA's efforts, Bayer Leverkusen refused to release him, as his absence would mean the team would lose him for at least six matches.\n\n\n=== 2015–2018: Asian Cup runner-up and Asian Games gold ===\n\nSon was selected for South Korea for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Australia. At the quarter-final stage, he scored both of the team's goals in the 2–0 extra time defeat of Uzbekistan. In the final against the hosts, managed by future manager Ange Postecoglou, he equalised in added time, but his team lost 2–1 after extra time. He was chosen as one of three forward in the Team of the Tournament.\nIn June 2016, Son was named as one of the three overage players in South Korea under-23 squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Son amassed two goals in the group stages with a goal against Fiji and another against Germany, helping his team to top the group with two wins and a draw. South Korea was eliminated by Honduras in the quarterfinals, with Son missing crucial chances.\nOn 3 September 2015 at the Hwaseong Stadium, Son scored a hat-trick in an 8–0 home win over Laos in the second round of qualification for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, Son broke his right forearm after falling awkwardly on his arm during a World Cup qualifier match in Doha against Qatar. He was part of the team that saw Korea qualify for the 2018 World Cup after a 0–0 draw against Uzbekistan on 5 September 2017. On 4 June 2018, Son was selected in 23-man squad for the World Cup. On 23 June, Son scored a goal from outside the penalty area – a curling strike into the top corner – though his side was defeated with a 2–1 loss to Mexico in their second group stage match of the World Cup. On 27 June, during their final group stage match, he scored the second goal in the 97th minute in their 2–0 victory over world champions Germany, sealing their elimination.\nSon was selected as one of three overage players permitted in the under-23 team for the football tournament at the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia. He captained the team in the final game of the group stage against Kyrgyzstan, scoring the only goal of the match to help the team reach the knockout rounds. He also captained the team in the knockout rounds and reached the final after the Taeguk Warriors beat Vietnam, 3–1. In the gold medal match, Son assisted in both extra-time goals in a 2–1 victory over Japan, which guaranteed the entire squad's exemption from mandatory military service.\n\n\n=== 2019–present: Assuming the captaincy ===\n\nSon was called up as captain for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup in the United Arab Emirates by Paulo Bento, but missed the first two group matches due to an agreement with Tottenham Hotspur related to his call-up. His play at the tournament was generally lethargic without a goal. He contributed to South Korea's both goals by providing an assist and winning a penalty in a 2–0 win over China. In contrast with the good start, he made one successful dribble (out of seven attempts) and one shot on target in the knockout rounds against Bahrain and Qatar. He returned to London after a 1–0 defeat to eventual champion Qatar in the quarter-finals.\nDespite still recovering from an eye injury, in October 2022, Son was named to lead the 26-man South Korean squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Due to the tenderness of his injury, Son wore a mask that covered nearly half his face. Son failed to score a goal for his nation's group stage matches, but successfully led South Korea to the round of 16, for the first time since 2010, following a match winning assist to Hwang Hee-chan in a shock 2–1 victory against Portugal on 2 December, before being eliminated by Brazil following a 4–1 defeat on 5 December.\nSon played for the national team under manager Jürgen Klinsmann in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. He won a penalty and converted it into the opening goal in the second group stage match against Jordan, which ended in a 2–2 draw. He scored South Korea's first penalty, contributing to a 4–2 penalty shoot-out win over Saudi Arabia in the round of 16. His best performance in the competition came in a 2–1 quarter-final win over Australia, where he won a crucial penalty in second-half stoppage time and scored the winning goal with a free-kick in extra time. South Korea once again met Jordan in the semi-finals, but he failed to prevent a 2–0 defeat to them.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\nSon is a versatile player who can play in any forward position, (winger, second striker, striker) and can even be deployed as an attacking midfielder or wing-back if necessary. He himself has confirmed this, saying, \"I don't care where I play. The main thing is I'm in the game. I can play as a second striker or behind. Whatever the coach says, I'll do. I don't have a favorite position. I'll be anywhere and always on the throttle.\"\nSon is known for his two-footed ability, explosive pace, positional sense, movement, close control and clinical finishing which make him especially effective on the counter-attack. Moreover, he has drawn praise from teammates and in the media for his selfless work-rate and defensive contribution, and is capable of providing assists for teammates, in addition to scoring goals himself. In a 2021 interview, Sir Alex Ferguson mentioned Son as a player that he wished he could have managed, calling him and then-teammate Harry Kane \"excellent players.\"\n\n\n== Sponsorship and media ==\nSon has a sponsorship deal with sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas. Since 2022, he has been a brand ambassador for British luxury fashion house Burberry. In March 2023, Son was named as the global face of the Burberry's first campaign under its new chief creative officer Daniel Lee along with Georgia May Jagger.\nIn February 2022, Son was selected as brand ambassador for American high-end luggage brand Tumi. In February 2024, he was upgraded to become a global ambassador for Tumi and appeared on its global campaign with the new TUMI 19 Degree Aluminum collection. On 7 August 2022, Son was named brand ambassador for Calvin Klein Underwear in South Korea.\nSon has two officially licensed NFT collections that have been released in collaboration with NFTStar (a sports fandom social platform with a web3 community) that are available for purchase on OpenSea. His first NFT collection is called the 'NFTStar Fan Pass – Son Heung Min', and the second NFT collection called 'Golden Shiny Boot' was a free mint project available for fan pass holders.\nSon has a Fortnite outfit.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSon has dated K-pop singers Bang Min-ah and Yoo So-young, and was single as of March 2019.\nSon used the suspension of football during the COVID-19 pandemic to complete South Korean mandatory military service. He was exempted from military service with a gold medal at the Asian Games, but he had to do basic military training regardless of exemption. He completed basic training in the Republic of Korea Marine Corps in Jeju in April–May 2020, finishing in the top five of 157 trainees.\nAs a South Korean player, Son has suffered racist abuse from fans during games and online. He is part of UEFA's Real Scars campaign, which seeks to raise awareness of online abuse and harassment of football players.\nSon is also a fan of the video game League of Legends.\nIn 2019, Son donated around £100,000 to the victims of the Goseong Fire, which left vast devastation in Goseong County, Gangwon, in his native South Korea. In 2020, Son donated £65,000 in aid, to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.\nSon opened Son Football Academy in his hometown Chuncheon with his father and his brother, at a cost of £11 million, mostly his money.\nOn 27 August 2025, Son threw the first pitch for Major League Baseball team Los Angeles Dodgers to kick-off their game against the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of match played 1 September 2025\n\n\n=== International ===\nAs of match played 10 June 2025\n\nAs of match played 10 June 2025\nScores and results list South Korea's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Son goal.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nUEFA Europa League: 2024–25\nEFL Cup runner-up: 2020–21\nUEFA Champions League runner-up: 2018–19\nSouth Korea U17\n\nAFC U-16 Championship runner-up: 2008\nSouth Korea U23\n\nAsian Games: 2018\nSouth Korea\n\nAFC Asian Cup runner-up: 2015\nIndividual\n\nFIFA Puskás Award: 2020\nBest Footballer in Asia: 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\nAFC Asian Cup Team of the Tournament: 2015, 2023\nAFC Asian International Player of the Year: 2015, 2017, 2019, 2023\nAFC Opta All-time XI at the FIFA World Cup: 2020\nAFC Fans' All-time XI at the FIFA World Cup: 2020\nAFC Asian Cup All-time XI: 2023\nThe Asian Awards Outstanding Achievement in Sports: 2016\nAIPS Asia Best Asian Male Athlete: 2018\nIFFHS Asian Men's Player of the Year: 2020, 2021, 2022\nIFFHS Asian Men's Team of the Year: 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024\nIFFHS Asian Men's Player of the Decade: 2021\nIFFHS Asian Men's Team of All Time: 2021\nFourFourTwo Best Asian Footballer of All Time: 2024\nUEFA Champions League Set-piece Goal of the Season: 2014–15\nEurosport Player of the Season: 2021–22\nBundesliga Debut of the Hinrunde: 2010\nHamburger SV All-time XI by Bundesliga: 2018\nKorean FA Player of the Year: 2013, 2014, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2024\nKorean FA Fans' Player of the Year: 2014, 2015\nKorean FA Goal of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2018, 2021, 2023, 2024\nCheongnyong Medal: 2022\nPremier League Player of the Month: September 2016, April 2017, October 2020, September 2023\nPremier League Goal of the Month: November 2018, December 2019\nPremier League Goal of the Season: 2019–20\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2021–22\nFA Cup top goalscorer: 2016–17\nPFA Fans' Premier League Player of the Month: January 2018\nPFA Premier League Team of the Year: 2020–21\nBBC Goal of the Season: 2019–20\nFantasy Premier League Team of the Season: 2020–21, 2021–22, 2023–24\nPremier League Player of the Year by London Football Awards: 2019\nTottenham Hotspur Goal of the Season: 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20, 2022–23, 2024–25\nTottenham Hotspur Player of the Season: 2018–19, 2019–20, 2021–22\nTottenham Hotspur Goal of the Decade: 2020\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\nList of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals\nList of footballers with 100 or more Premier League goals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nProfile at the Tottenham Hotspur F.C. website\nSon Heung-min – FIFA competition record (archived) \nSon Heung-min – UEFA competition record (archive) \nSon Heung-min – AFC competition record \nSon Heung-min at Premier League (archived)",

        "title": "Su From So",
        "content": "Su From So is a 2025 Indian Kannada-language comedy drama film written and directed by J. P. Thuminad in his directorial debut and is produced by Shashidhar Shetty Baroda, Ravi Rai Kalasa, and Raj B. Shetty under Lighter Buddha Films. It stars Shaneel Gautham, J. P. Thuminad, Sandhya Arakere, Prakash Thuminad, Deepak Rai Panaje, Mime Ramdas and Raj B. Shetty.\nSet in the coastal village of Marlur linked to Someshwara, the story follows Ashoka, a carefree young man whose innocent crush spirals into rumours of possession by a ghost named Sulochana, upending village life through a cascade of comedic supernatural events.\nThe film was released theatrically on 25 July 2025. Upon release, it received overwhelmingly positive reviews and became a commercial success. It is also the highest-grossing Kannada film of the year at the time of release. It was credited with bringing back large footfalls in Kannada cinema after Raajakumara (2017), KGF Series (2018-2022), Kantara (2022) and 777 Charlie (2022).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAshoka, a young man from the village, develops a crush on a local girl.

        "title": "Gaza war",
        "content": "The Gaza war is an armed conflict in the Gaza Strip and Israel, fought since 7 October 2023, as part of the unresolved Israeli–Palestinian and Gaza–Israel conflicts dating back to the 20th century. On 7 October 2023, Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel, in which 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 815 civilians, were killed, and 251 taken hostage with the stated goal of forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners. Since the start of the Israeli offensive that followed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, over 63,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, almost half of them women and children, and more than 160,000 injured. A study in The Lancet estimated 64,260 deaths in Gaza from traumatic injuries by June 2024, while noting a potentially larger death toll when \"indirect\" deaths are included. As of May 2025, a comparable figure for traumatic injury deaths would be 93,000.\nThe Gaza war follows the wars of 2008–2009, 2012, 2014, and the 2021 clashes. After clearing militants from its territory, Israel launched a bombing campaign and invaded Gaza on 27 October with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. Israeli forces launched numerous campaigns, including the Rafah offensive from May 2024, three battles fought around Khan Yunis, and the siege of North Gaza from October 2024, and have assassinated Hamas leaders inside and outside of Gaza. A temporary ceasefire in November 2023 broke down, and a second ceasefire in January 2025 ended with a surprise attack by Israel in March 2025. In August 2025, Israel began an offensive to take over Gaza City in the north.\nThe war has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel's tightened blockade cut off basic necessities, causing a severe hunger crisis, malnutrition, and imminent to confirmed famine as of August 2025. By early 2025, Israel had caused unprecedented destruction in Gaza and made large parts of it uninhabitable, leveling entire cities and destroying hospitals (including children's hospitals), religious and cultural landmarks, educational facilities, agricultural land, and cemeteries. Gazan journalists, health workers, aid workers and other members of civil society have been detained, tortured and killed. Nearly all of the strip's 2.3 million Palestinian population have been forcibly displaced. Over 100,000 Israelis were internally displaced at the height of the conflict. The first day was the deadliest in Israel's history, and the war is the deadliest for Palestinians in the broader conflict.\nMany human rights organizations and scholars of genocide studies and international law say that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, though some dispute this. Experts and human rights organizations have also stated that Israel and Hamas have committed war crimes. A case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza is being reviewed by the International Court of Justice, while the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant and Mohammed Deif, though Deif's was withdrawn because he was killed. Torture and sexual violence have been committed by Palestinian militant groups and by Israeli forces.\nIsrael has received extensive military and diplomatic support from the United States, which has vetoed multiple pro-ceasefire resolutions from the UN Security Council. The war has reverberated regionally, with Axis of Resistance groups across several Arab countries and Iran clashing with the United States and Israel, including the 12-day Iran–Israel war. A year of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the ongoing Israeli operations in Syria, as well as contributing to the fall of the Assad regime. The war continues to have significant regional and international repercussions, with large protests worldwide calling for a ceasefire, as well as a surge of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian racism.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Gaza war is referred to by different names. Israel calls it the \"Iron Swords war\" (Hebrew: מלחמת חרבות ברזל). It has also been referred to as the \"Simchat Torah war\", as the war started on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, reminiscent of the Yom Kippur War. Palestinian militant groups refer to it as the \"battle of al-Aqsa Flood\" (Arabic: معركة طوفان الأقصى), in reference to Operation al-Aqsa Flood. Western media outlets have variably described it as the \"Israel–Hamas war\" while others use \"war on Gaza\". Others have used the term \"October 7 war\", \"Gaza genocide\", \"second Nakba\", or \"Nakba 2023\".\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn the 1948 Palestine war, the Zionist movement culminated in the establishment of the State of Israel over most of what had been Mandatory Palestine, with the exception of two separated territories that became known as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which were held by Jordan and Egypt respectively. Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The upcoming period witnessed two popular uprisings by Palestinians against the Israeli occupation; the First and Second Intifadas in 1987 and 2000 respectively, with the latter's end seeing Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005.\nSince 2007, the Gaza Strip has been governed by Hamas, an Islamist militant group, while the West Bank remained under the control of the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. After Hamas's takeover, Israel imposed a blockade of the Gaza Strip that significantly damaged its economy. Israel justified the blockade by citing security concerns, but international rights groups have characterized it as a form of collective punishment. By 2023, UNRWA reported that 81% of people were living below the poverty level, with 63% being food insecure and dependent on international assistance.\nSince 2007, Israel and Hamas, along with other Palestinian militant groups based in Gaza, have engaged in conflict, including in four wars: in 2008–2009, 2012, 2014, and 2021. Combined, these conflicts killed approximately 6,400 Palestinians and 300 Israelis. In 2018–2019, there were large weekly organized protests near the Gaza-Israel border to call for the right to return. The Israel Defense Forces violently suppressed the protests, killing hundreds and injuring thousands of Palestinians by sniper fire. Soon after a short 2021 conflict occurred, Hamas's military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, started planning an operation against Israel, which became the 7 October attacks. According to diplomats, Hamas had repeatedly said in the months leading up to October 2023 that it did not want another military escalation in Gaza as it would worsen the humanitarian crisis that occurred after the 2021 conflict.\nHamas officials stated that the attack was a response to the Israeli occupation, blockade of the Gaza Strip, desecration of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Israeli settler violence against Palestinians, restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians, whom Hamas sought to release by taking Israeli hostages. Numerous commentators have identified the broader context of Israeli occupation as a cause of the war. The Associated Press wrote that Palestinians are \"in despair over a never-ending occupation in the West Bank and suffocating blockade of Gaza\". Several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, B'Tselem and Human Rights Watch have likened the Israeli occupation to apartheid, although supporters of Israel dispute this characterization. However, an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice published in July 2024 affirmed the occupation as being illegal and said it violated Article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid. The Netanyahu government has been criticized within Israel for granting work permits to Gazan residents, facilitating the transfer of funds to Hamas and pursuing relative calm. These actions have been criticized as having backfired in light of the attacks on 7 October 2023. US President Joe Biden has said the aim of the 7 October attacks was to disrupt the Saudi–Israel normalization talks.\n\n\n== War in Israel and Gaza ==\n\n\n=== 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel ===\n\nIn the morning of 7 October 2023, during the Jewish holidays of Simchat Torah and Shemini Atzeret on Shabbat, Hamas announced the start of what it called \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\", firing between 3,000 and 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of 20 minutes, killing at least five people. In the evening, Hamas launched another barrage of 150 rockets towards Israel. Simultaneously, around 3,000 Hamas militants infiltrated Israel from Gaza using trucks, motorcycles, bulldozers, speedboats, and paragliders. They took over checkpoints at Kerem Shalom and Erez, and created openings in the border fence in five other places.\nMilitants massacred civilians in several kibbutzim, where they took hostages and set fire to homes. In a massacre at an outdoor music festival near Re'im, at least 325 people were killed, with more injured or taken hostage. In total, 251 people, mostly civilians, were taken hostage, including children, elderly people, and soldiers. Hamas militants also reportedly engaged in mutilation, torture, and sexual and gender-based violence.\nThe 7 October attacks were described as \"an intelligence failure for the ages\" and a \"failure of imagination\" on the part of the Israeli government. A BBC report commented on Hamas's \"extraordinary levels of operational security\". It later emerged that abnormal Hamas movements had been detected the previous day by Israeli intelligence, but the military's alert level was not raised and political leaders were not informed.\nA briefing in The Economist noted that \"the assault dwarf[ed] all other mass murders of Israeli civilians\", and that \"the last time before October 7th that this many Jews were murdered on a single day was during the Holocaust.\" According to both Hamas officials and external observers, the attack was a calculated effort to create a \"permanent\" state of war and revive the Palestinian cause.\n\n\n=== Initial Israeli counter-operation (October 2023) ===\n\nThe IDF began Israel's counter-attack several hours after the Hamas-led invasion. The first helicopters sent to support the military reached the Israeli areas surrounding the Gaza Strip an hour after the fighting began. Their crews encountered difficulties in determining which places were occupied by invading militants, and distinguishing between Israeli civilians, IDF soldiers, and Palestinian militants on the ground. A June 2024 UN report and a July 2024 Haaretz investigation revealed that the IDF ordered the Hannibal Directive to be used, killing an unknown number of Israeli civilians and soldiers.\nThe attack was a complete surprise to the Israelis. In a televised broadcast, Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, announced that the country was at war. He threatened to \"turn all the places where Hamas is organized and hiding into cities of ruins\", called Gaza \"the city of evil\", and urged its residents to leave. Overnight, Israel's Security Cabinet voted to act to bring about the \"destruction of the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad\". The Israel Electric Corporation, which supplies 80% of the Gaza Strip's electricity, cut off power to the area. This reduced Gaza's power supply from 120 MW to 20 MW, provided by power plants paid for by the Palestinian Authority.\nThe IDF declared a \"state of readiness for war\", mobilized tens of thousands of army reservists, and declared a state of emergency for areas within 80 kilometers (50 mi) of Gaza. The Yamam counterterrorism unit was deployed, along with four new divisions, augmenting 31 existing battalions. Reservists were reported deployed in Gaza, in the West Bank, and along borders with Lebanon and Syria. Residents near Gaza were asked to stay inside, while civilians in southern and central Israel were \"required to stay next to shelters\". The southern region of Israel was closed to civilian movement, and roads were closed around Gaza and Tel Aviv. While Ben Gurion Airport and Ramon Airport remained operational, multiple airlines cancelled flights to and from Israel. On 9 or 10 October, Hamas offered to release all civilian hostages held in Gaza if Israel would call off its planned invasion of the Gaza Strip, but the Israeli government rejected the offer.\n\n\n==== Blockade, bombardment, and evacuation of northern Gaza ====\n\nFollowing the surprise attack, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes that they said targeted Hamas targets, employing its artificial intelligence Habsora (\"The Gospel\") software. These airstrikes were killing, on average, 350 persons per day during the first 20 days, totaling over 7,000 deaths during that time. Israel also rescued two hostages before declaring a state of war for the first time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. On 9 October, Defense Minister Gallant announced a \"complete siege\" of the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity and blocking the entry of food and fuel. This order drew criticism from Human Rights Watch (HRW) who described it as \"abhorrent\" and as a \"call to commit a war crime\". Gallant backed down under pressure from US President Joe Biden, and a deal was struck ten days later to allow aid into Gaza. The first such aid convoy entered Gaza on 21 October, while fuel did not arrive until November.\nOn 13 October, the IDF ordered all civilians in Gaza City to evacuate to areas south of the Wadi Gaza within 24 hours. The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs responded by telling residents in northern Gaza to defy those orders. The Israeli order was widely condemned as \"outrageous\" and \"impossible\", and calls were made for it to be reversed. As a part of the order, the IDF outlined a six-hour window on 13 October for refugees to flee south along specified routes. An explosion along one of the safe routes killed 70 Palestinians. Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the attack. The IDF said Hamas set up roadblocks to keep Gaza residents from evacuating. Israeli officials, foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations condemned Hamas's alleged use of hospitals and civilians as human shields, which has been contested by Amnesty International and by Hamas themselves. Israeli soldiers and Palestinians, as well as human rights groups, have also accused the IDF of similarly using human shields.\nOn 17 October, Israel bombed areas of southern Gaza. Late in the evening, an explosion occurred in the parking lot of the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist Hospital in the center of Gaza City, killing hundreds. The ongoing conflict prevented independent on-site analysis. Palestinian statements that it was an Israeli airstrike were denied by the IDF, which stated that the explosion resulted from a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who denied any involvement.\n\n\n=== Initial invasion to first truce (October–November 2023) ===\n\nOn 27 October, after building up an invasion force of over 100,000 soldiers, the IDF launched a large-scale ground incursion into parts of northern Gaza. Israeli airstrikes targeted the area around al-Quds hospital, where around 14,000 civilians were believed to be sheltering. The following day, the IDF struck Jabalia refugee camp, killing 50 and wounding 150 Palestinians. Israel said the attack killed a senior Hamas commander, whose presence Hamas denied, and dozens of militants. The attack resulted in several ambassador recalls.\n\nOn 31 October, Israel bombed a six-story apartment building in central Gaza, killing at least 106 civilians including 54 children in what Human Rights Watch called an \"apparent war crime\". On 1 November, the first group of evacuees left Gaza for Egypt. Five hundred evacuees, comprising critically wounded and foreign nationals, were evacuated over several days. On 18 November, Israel struck a marked Médecins Sans Frontières convoy, killing two aid workers. On 22 November, Israel and Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire agreement, providing for a four-day pause in hostilities to allow for the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza. The deal also provided for the release of approximately 150 Palestinian women and children incarcerated by Israel.\n\n\n=== First ceasefire (November 2023) ===\n\nFollowing the introduction of a Qatari-brokered truce on 24 November 2023, active fighting in the Gaza Strip ceased. Hamas exchanged some hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israel arrested almost as many Palestinians as it released during the truce. Prisoner exchanges continued until 28 November, when both Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the truce. On 30 November, in a \"last-minute agreement\", Hamas released eight hostages in exchange for the release of 30 imprisoned Palestinians and a one-day truce extension. The truce expired on 1 December, as Israel and Hamas blamed each other for failing to agree on an extension.\n\n\n=== Resumption of hostilities (December 2023 – January 2024) ===\n\nIsrael adopted a grid system to order precise evacuations within Gaza. It was criticized as inaccessible, due to the lack of electricity and internet connectivity in Gaza, and confusing. Some evacuation instructions were vague or contradictory, and Israel sometimes struck areas it had told people to evacuate to. Law experts called these warnings ineffective. Amnesty International found no evidence of Hamas targets at the sites of some strikes, and requested that they be investigated as possible war crimes. On 6 December, Refaat Alareer, a prominent professor and writer in Gaza, was killed by an Israeli airstrike. His poem \"If I Must Die\" was widely circulated after his death.\n\nBy December, IDF troops had reached the centers of Khan Yunis, Jabalia, and Shuja'iyya. Intensified bombing pushed Palestinian civilians south to Rafah. Between 7 and 10 December, Israel detained more than 150 men; according to Israel, they surrendered en masse, but this account was disputed by several publications. On 15 December, the IDF killed three Israeli hostages in a friendly fire incident, after mistakenly identifying them as enemies.\nOn 1 January 2024, Israel withdrew from neighborhoods in North Gaza. On 15 January, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the most intense fighting in the north of the Gaza Strip had ended, and a new phase of low-intensity fighting was about to begin. By 18 January, the IDF, who had previously stated that Hamas control over North Gaza was \"dismantled\", reported that Hamas had significantly rebuilt its fighting strength in North Gaza.\nOn 22 January, 24 IDF soldiers died in the deadliest day for the IDF since the invasion began. Of these, 21 died when Palestinian militants fired an RPG at a tank, causing adjacent buildings to collapse. On 29 January, Israeli forces killed Hind Rajab, a five-year-old girl, and six of her family members when the car they were driving was struck by Israeli tank and machine gun fire; two rescue workers who attempted to retrieve Rajab were also killed. The Red Crescent released the audio from Rajab's phone call with rescue workers, causing international outrage over her death.\n\n\n=== Build-up to the Rafah offensive (February–April 2024) ===\n\nBetween February and May 2024, preparations to invade Rafah became a dominant theme in Israeli officials' public rhetoric. On 12 February, Israel started a bombing campaign on Rafah. Food supplies increasingly became an issue. On 5 February, Israeli gunboats shelled a clearly marked UNRWA convoy, forcing UNRWA to suspend its operations for almost three weeks, affecting 200,000 people. On 29 February, Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians waiting for food aid southwest of Gaza City, killing 100 and wounding 750. Some of the victims were run over by trucks as panic spread. Survivors described it as an intentional ambush by Israeli forces. On 1 March, the United States announced it would begin an operation to airdrop food aid into Gaza. Some experts called the initiative performative, saying it would not alleviate the food situation. During his State of the Union Address, Biden announced that a temporary port on Gaza's coast would be constructed to enable aid delivery.\nAl-Shifa Hospital, previously besieged in November 2023, was raided again between 18 March and 1 April. Israeli forces killed Faiq al-Mabhouh, who they said was head of the operations directorate of Hamas's internal security service. Hamas said al-Mabhouh was in charge of civil law enforcement and had been coordinating aid deliveries to north Gaza. The IDF said it killed 200 people in the hospital fighting, including senior Hamas leaders; this account was disputed. Survivors denied that militants had organized on the hospital grounds. Israeli forces were accused of reducing the hospital to a \"blown out, fire-blackened\" state, and of massacring 400 Palestinians.\nA 25 March UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for Ramadan was ignored by the IDF. On 1 April, seven international aid workers from World Central Kitchen (WCK) were killed in an Israeli airstrike south of Deir al-Balah. WCK, who said their vehicles were clearly marked and their location known to Israel, subsequently withdrew from operating in Gaza alongside ANERA and Project HOPE. On 4 April, Israel opened the Erez Crossing for the first time since 7 October after US pressure.\nBy 6 March, Israel had completed a new east–west road in Gaza. It was intended to mobilize troops and supplies, to connect and defend IDF positions on al-Rashid and Salah al-Din streets, and prevent people in the south of Gaza from returning to the north. On 7 April, Israel withdrew from the south Gaza Strip, with only one brigade remaining in the Netzarim Corridor in the north. Palestinians displaced from that city began to return from the south of the Gaza Strip. Israel planned to initiate its ground offensive in Rafah around mid-April, but postponed to consider its response to the Iranian strikes on Israel. On 25 April, Israel intensified strikes on Rafah ahead of its threatened invasion.\n\n\n=== Beginning of the Rafah offensive (May–July 2024) ===\n\nOn 6 May, the IDF ordered 100,000 civilians in eastern Rafah to evacuate to Al-Mawasi, west of Khan Yunis. Later that day, Hamas announced that it had accepted the terms of a ceasefire brokered by Egypt and Qatar. The deal included a 6-week ceasefire and exchange of prisoners. However, Israel rejected this deal. Israel said that it found the terms unacceptable, but that it would continue to negotiate while the military operation on Rafah was ongoing to \"exert military pressure on Hamas\". On 31 May, the United States announced a ceasefire framework for ending the war.\n\nThe same day, the IDF entered the outskirts of Rafah, seizing control of the Gaza side of the Rafah Crossing to Egypt the following day. By 15 May, an estimated 600,000 had fled Rafah and another 100,000 from the north, according to the United Nations.\nOn 24 May, the United Nations said only 906 aid truckloads had reached Gaza since Israel's Rafah operation began. Israel bombed the Tel al-Sultan displacement camp in Rafah on 26 May, killing at least 45 people, allegedly including two senior Hamas officials. This provoked a skirmish between Egyptian and Israeli soldiers at the Gaza border in which one Egyptian soldier was killed. Less than 48 hours afterwards, another evacuation zone, the Al-Mawasi refugee camp, was bombed, killing at least 21 people. The IDF denied involvement in the attack.\nOn 6 June, Israel bombed a school in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing dozens. Two days later, Israel conducted an attack on Nuseirat refugee camp which resulted in the rescue of four hostages and the deaths of 274 Palestinians. On 27 June, Israeli forces re-invaded the al-Shuja'iyya neighborhood. According to Middle East Monitor and ReliefWeb, between 4 July and 10 August, Israel attacked 21 schools in Gaza, killing 274 people.\n\n\n=== Rafah, Khan Yunis, and general bombardment (July–September 2024) ===\n\nOn 22 July, the IDF began a brief second invasion of Khan Yunis. Israel ordered the evacuation of the eastern part of Khan Yunis; 73 people were killed during the first day of the attack. Footage from an Israeli drone surfaced showing the destruction of the Grand Mosque in Khan Yunis. A third, month-long battle ended on 30 August when the IDF withdrew its 98th battalion from Khan Yunis and Deir el-Balah, stating it had killed over 250 Palestinian militants.\nOn 13 July, at least 90 people were killed and 300 were injured in an Israeli strike on Al-Mawasi and 22 people were killed in an Israeli strike targeting people gathered to pray in the Al-Shati refugee camp. On 10 August, at least 80 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Al-Tabaeen school. The IDF said it had killed 200 militants and discovered dozens of weapons in Tel al-Sultan in one week. On 10 September, Israeli missile strikes on a tent encampment in Al-Mawasi killed 19 to 40 people.\n\n\n=== Continued operations throughout Gaza (October–December 2024) ===\n\nIn October, Israeli airstrikes on Shuhada al-Aqsa mosque in Deir el-Balah and a school in central Gaza killed at least 26 Palestinians and injured over 93. An Israeli strike on Rufaida school, which was serving as a shelter for displaced people in Deir el-Balah, killed at least 28 people and injured 54 others.\nOn 8 October, the IDF began to encircle Jabalia camp, killing several Palestinian militants and civilians in air strikes and street battles. On 10 October, the IDF issued evacuation orders for three hospitals in northern Gaza. The IDF's air and ground operations in Jabalia continued for the rest of October. During that month and November, strikes on Jabalia killed hundreds of people. On 10 December, the IDF said that it killed 10 Hamas operatives who were involved in the killing of three Israeli soldiers one day prior. On 30 December, the IDF said that it killed dozens of militants in Jabalia.\nThe IDF has been accused of blocking aid delivery to the Gaza Strip by allowing looting gangs to target aid convoys. On 16 November 98 out of 109 food trucks carrying UN aid from Kerem Shalom crossing were looted in Israeli-controlled areas of the Gaza strip. The Abu Shabab clan, a rival of Hamas, was widely blamed for the attacks. On 1 December, the UN suspended its aid shipments to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing, blaming Israel for failing to \"ensure safe conditions for delivering relief supplies.\" On 12 December, two Israeli strikes on an aid convoy in southern Gaza killed 13 people and wounded at least 30 people, several of them seriously.\nOn 16 October, IDF ground forces killed Yahya Sinwar in a shootout in Tal as-Sultan. The conscript soldiers who participated in the shootout were initially unaware of Sinwar's presence, and he was identified the following day by his dental records. There were no hostages in Sinwar's vicinity at the time of his death, and no civilian casualties were reported. Biden urged Israel to end the war after Sinwar's death.\n\n\n==== Siege of northern Gaza ====\n\nOn 13 October, senior IDF officials told Haaretz that the government was not seeking to revive hostage talks and that political leadership was pushing for the annexation of parts of the Gaza Strip. In the later weeks of October, Israel's siege of North Gaza intensified and daily aid shipments dropped significantly. Eyewitnesses reported the shelling of hospitals, razing of shelters, and abductions of men and boys by the Israeli military, leading to speculation that Israel had decided to implement a plan by a group of retired generals to turn the northern Strip into a closed military zone and declare all who refuse to leave as combatants. On 5 November, Israeli Brigadier General Itzik Cohen told reporters that \"there is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return\" and that no food aid had entered northern Gaza because there were \"no more civilians left\".\nThe IDF continued its encirclement of Jabalia by sending tanks to Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun and issuing evacuation orders to residents. On 24 October, an IDF attack destroyed at least 10 residential buildings in the Jabalia refugee camp. According to an assessment by Gaza Civil Defense, 150 people were killed or injured. On 25 October, the WHO said it had lost contact with Kamal Adwan hospital, and UN human rights chief Volker Türk called recent developments in North Gaza the \"darkest moment\" in the war so far. Food aid to Gaza reached a new low in October at an average of 30 trucks per day, or less than 6% of the daily pre-war average. Residents of northern Gaza said in November that no aid had reached their cities since 5 October. The UN warned that the situation had become \"apocalyptic\" and that \"The entire Palestinian population in North Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence\". On 2 November, UNICEF said that over 50 children were killed in Israeli strikes in Jabalia in the past two days. On 12 November, aid in Gaza fell to its lowest level in 11 months despite a US ultimatum that it be restored.\nOn 24 November, Israel issued a new wave of evacuation orders, triggering another round of displacements in Jabalia. UNRWA said that Israel had rejected nine attempts to deliver aid to north Gaza in the month of November and obstructed an additional 82 attempts; they added that the survival conditions were diminishing for the 60,000 to 70,000 civilians remaining in north Gaza. Mahmoud Almadhoun, a chef who founded the Gaza Soup Kitchen, was targeted and killed by an Israeli quadcopter near Kamal Adwan hospital. On 5 December, Israeli Army Radio announced that 18,000 Palestinians were evacuated from Beit Lahia and that soldiers killed approximately 20 militants during fighting on the previous day.\nOn 13 December, Israeli tank fire killed Dr. Sayeed Joudeh, the last orthopedic surgeon in northern Gaza. On 26 December, an Israeli air strike hit a building in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan Hospital, killing about 50 people, including five staff. Over the next days, the World Health Organization announced that the hospital had been put out of service by Israeli attacks and the hospital's director, Hussam Abu Safiya, had been abducted: the IDF forced patients to evacuate to an already-destroyed hospital by cutting off their oxygen. The IDF said it had killed 19 militants during its raid; Gaza Health Ministry said that 50 people including hospital staff were killed.\n\n\n=== Second ceasefire (January–March 2025) ===\n\nOn 15 January 2025, an agreement was announced between Israel and Hamas, through the mediation of Qatar, in which Hamas agreed to release a number of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip in exchange for Hamas militants and other Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons. The two parties also agreed to a ceasefire for the second time during the war; it went into effect on the morning of 19 January 2025. On 27 January, tens of thousands of Palestinians began a mass return to northern Gaza after Israel opened a corridor for civilian movement following a 48-hour delay. Hamas claimed that Israel had violated the terms of the ceasefire, and announced the suspension of the release of Israeli hostages on 10 February. After Netanyahu and Trump threatened to restart fighting in Gaza, Hamas relented on 13 February, allowing the release of hostages to begin again two days later. On 22 February, Hamas released six Israeli hostages; however, Israel refused to release the 600 Palestinian prisoners, with Netanyahu objecting to the \"use of hostages for propaganda\" and saying that Israel would release the prisoners once the next hostage release was guaranteed without the ceremonies. On 25 February, Israel and Hamas reached a deal to exchange the bodies of Israeli hostages who were agreed to be handed over during the first phase for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, without public ceremony.\nOn 1 March, the day the first phase of the ceasefire was scheduled to end, Hamas rejected an Israeli proposal to extend it to release more hostages, calling for the implementation of the second phase. Negotiations for implementing the second phase of the ceasefire agreement, intended to see the release of all remaining living hostages, the withdrawal of the Israeli military from Gaza and a permanent end to the war, were supposed to have begun in February, 16 days after the initial ceasefire began, but never happened. Netanyahu's office said that Israel endorsed a US plan to extend the Gaza truce for the Ramadan and Passover periods. Under this plan, half of the living and dead hostages would be released on the first day of the extended truce and the remaining hostages would be released at the end of the period if a permanent truce was reached. It claimed that the initial deal allowed Israel to resume war at any moment after 1 March if negotiations were deemed ineffective. Following Hamas's refusal to accept the US proposal, Netanyahu ceased the entry of aid to Gaza the next day.\nThe humanitarian aid blockade was condemned by mediators, namely Egypt, as a violation of the ceasefire, which stipulated that phase one would automatically be extended as long as phase two negotiations were in progress. On 9 March, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen ordered a halt to supply of Israeli electricity to Gaza. On 14 March, Hamas said that it agreed to a proposal from mediators to release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander and the bodies of four dual-national hostages. The US and Israel rejected the offer, which did not conform to their joint proposal calling for the release of five living hostages on the first day of an extended ceasefire.\n\n\n=== Israeli attacks resume (March–April 2025) ===\n\nOn 18 March, Israel launched a surprise attack which included airstrikes across Gaza, killing over 400 (per Gaza officials) and ending the ceasefire. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz then declared that Israel has \"returned to fighting in Gaza\". Israel stated the attack was due to the refusal of Hamas to extend the first phase of the ceasefire by releasing more hostages, and was also in response to Hamas's rearming and reorganizing over the course of the two months of ceasefire. Hamas said that it had adhered to the ceasefire agreement, implementing it precisely, and that Israel had resumed aggression and war. Internationally, the strikes were seen to stymie hopes for a lasting ceasefire. Observers have noted that Israel chose to launch the attack on the day Netanyahu would testify in his corruption trial, forcing the legal proceedings to be postponed.\nMultiple senior members of Gaza's government and the Hamas political bureau were killed during this round of fighting, including Issam al-Da'alis, whose position is akin to the Prime Minister of Gaza, Salah al-Bardawil and Ismail Barhoum (members of the political bureau), Mahmoud Abu Watfa (undersecretary of the Interior Ministry of the Gaza Strip) and Bahjat Abu Sultan (chief of internal security). Palestinian Islamic Jihad spokesman Abu Hamza was also killed in the airstrikes. The Popular Resistance Committees announced the death of Muhammad al-Batran, commander of its artillery unit and a member of its Central Military Brigade Council.\nOn 19 March, the IDF said that it had launched \"targeted ground activities\" in the Gaza Strip to create a \"partial buffer\" in the territory, partially recapturing the center of the Netzarim Corridor. The IDF also bombed the UN Office for Project Services building in Deir al Balah, killing a UN staffer and six other international workers. Two days later, the IDF destroyed the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital via controlled demolition. On 23 March, IDF troops fired on several humanitarian vehicles, including five ambulances, a fire truck, and a United Nations vehicle, in Al-Hashashin area in southern Rafah, killing 15 Palestinian medics. It was not until 30 March that their bodies were discovered in a mass grave.\nOn 25 March, amid the Israeli operation, hundreds to thousands of Palestinians in Gaza rose up in protest against Hamas and the continued war, calling for an end to the war and an end to Hamas's rule over the Gaza Strip. The protests were caused by war-weariness and dissatisfaction with Hamas, specifically their alleged misuse of humanitarian aid intended for Gazans, suppression of the freedom of speech and of the press, and abuse of Palestinian civilians.\nOn 27 March, an Israeli airstrike on a tent in Jabalia killed Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua. The same day, a World Central Kitchen volunteer was killed in an Israeli strike on a WCK supported community kitchen as meals were being served. On 9 April, Israeli warplanes bombed a multi-story residential building in Shuja'iyya, killing over 35 Palestinians and wounding at least another 70. On 12 April, the IDF announced that it had encircled Rafah, and planned to seize portions of it while ordering large-scale evacuations of its population. On 13 April, two Israeli missiles hit Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, forcing patients to evacuate and destroying its emergency department. On 15 April, Yahya Fathi Abd al-Qader Abu Shaar, the head of Hamas' weapons smuggling network, was killed by the Israeli army in the area of Khan Younis. On 22 April, an attack on a residential building in Khan Younis started a fire that killed at least 11 Palestinians. On 23 April, Israel bombed a school in Gaza City sheltering displaced families, killing at least 10.\n\n\n=== Renewed Israeli offensive (May–August 2025) ===\n\nOn 3 May, Israel announced its plans to expand the Gaza offensive and mobilized thousands of reservists. On 7 May, World Central Kitchen said it was forced to stop food distribution in Gaza because it ran out of supplies. On 8 May, two Israeli airstrikes on the last restaurant in Gaza City and a simultaneous strike on a crowded nearby market killed at least 33 people. At least 143 people were killed in Gaza on 15 May, making it the deadliest day of the war since the end of the ceasefire in March.\nOn 13 May 2025, Israeli airstrikes struck the compound of the Gaza European Hospital in Khan Yunis and the surrounding area, killing Mohammed Sinwar and Muhammad Shabana who were in underground tunnels. In June the IDF said that Sinwar's body was retrieved and identified. On 30 August, Hamas confirmed Sinwar's death. \nOn 16 May, Israel announced the launch of Operation Gideon's Chariots, a military offensive aimed at taking control of the entire Gaza Strip. The move was widely condemned by several of Israel's allies, a number of whom threatened sanctions. On 25 May, an Israeli airstrike on the Fahmi al-Jawjawi school in Daraj, Gaza City, killed at least 36 people—including 18 children and six women—and injured over 55. In late May a new militia in Gaza, the Popular Forces, began operating under the authority of the Abu Shabab clan in opposition to Hamas. Avigdor Lieberman accused Netanyahu and the Israeli government of funding and arming this militia.\nOn 27 May, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began operations in Tel al-Sultan to deliver humanitarian aid. As thousands of starving Palestinians overwhelmed the distribution center, Israeli forces fired into the crowd, killing ten and injuring at least 62 Palestinians. In a series of subsequent attacks on aid seekers, more than 1,300 were killed. On 30 June, an Israeli airstrike on al-Baqa cafeteria killed at least 41 Palestinians—including photojournalist Ismail Abu Hatab—and injured another 75.\nOn 20 July, the IDF issued evacuation orders for the city of Deir al-Balah, where it had not launched a ground offensive since the start of the war. On the following day, Israeli forces advanced into the outskirts of Deir al-Balah as airstrikes hit the city.\n\n\n=== Gaza City offensive (August 2025–present) ===\n\nIn early August 2025, the Israeli security cabinet approved a plan to occupy Gaza City. The plan drew condemnation from the UN, the European Council president, and several foreign countries. Germany said it would suspend the approval of arms exports to Israel in response to the plan, and Norway said it would re-evaluate its sovereign wealth fund's investments in Israel.\nOn 10 August 2025, Israeli forces struck a press tent outside al-Shifa Hospital, killing six Al-Jazeera journalists including Anas Al-Sharif, bringing the total number of journalists killed by Israel during the war to 192.\nOn 12 August 2025, the IDF killed five militants in the Gaza Strip who had posed as aid workers for the World Central Kitchen. World Central Kitchen confirmed that armed operatives had posed as its employees and condemned their actions.\nOn 19 August 2025, with extensive protests in Israel advocating for an agreement to secure the release of the 20 remaining live Israeli hostages in Gaza, Hamas committed in a proposed arrangement to release approximately half of these hostages, along with the deceased, in a staggered agreement in return for around 150 Palestinians currently detained in Israeli prisons during a projected 60-day ceasefire. Israel was expected to respond to the Gaza ceasefire plan by 22 August but did not.\nOn 20 August 2025, Israel began the first stages of an offensive to take over Gaza City, and called up 60,000 reservists for the beginning of September.\nOn 25 August 2025, an Israeli double tap strike on Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza killed 22 people, including five journalists. The IDF stated on X that a camera on the roof had been used to \"direct terrorist activities\" against its soldiers, but journalists say it was only the Reuters camera. Subsequently Binyamin Netanyahu said that he \"deeply regretted\" the strike which he described as a \"mishap\".\nOn 30 August, CNN reported that Israel had been dropping leaflets over Gaza City telling residents to move south of Wadi Gaza. However, the International Committee of the Red Cross said: \"Such an evacuation would trigger a massive population movement that no area in the Gaza Strip can absorb, given the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and the extreme shortages of food, water, shelter and medical care.\"\n\n\n== Post-war plans ==\n\n\n=== Israeli leaders' plans ===\nOn 16 October 2023, the Israeli war cabinet defined four central goals for the war as outlined in the document: toppling the Hamas regime and dismantling its capabilities, remove the terrorist threat from Gaza, intensive action to return the hostages, and maintaining the security of Israel's borders and its residents.\nAbout a month after the start of the war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that overall security responsibility for what happens in the Gaza Strip would rest with Israel after the war, for an indefinite period of time. In another interview, he said that the Strip was \"demilitarized and under a civilian government, but a reliable force would be required to enter and kill the murderers so that an entity like Hamas would not emerge\". He told the heads of the authorities in the western Negev that the IDF would continue to hold the Gaza Strip for a certain period after the war and that after the elimination of Hamas there would be overall Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip, including full demilitarization. On November 11, Netanyahu expressed opposition to the possibility of the Palestinian Authority assuming civilian control over the Strip. In response to a question about the possibility of returning Jewish settlement to the Strip in one form or another, he objected and said that he did not see this as a realistic goal.\nIn February 2024, Netanyahu presented his proposal for the \"Day After Hamas\" to Security Cabinet of Israel. It included management by local people and was not rejected or approved by a vote at the cabinet.\nAbout 100 days after the start of the war, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke of the need for a political-diplomatic decision and said that the end of the military campaign must be anchored in a political act. According to him, political thought guides the military action and the lack of a political decision could harm the progress of the military operation.\nAbout six months after the start of the war, it was reported that Netanyahu was preventing a strategic discussion on the goals of the war in light of its progress, contrary to the agreement reached in the war cabinet. On May 12 2024, it was reported that the IDF leadership was demanding that the prime minister make a decision on post war issue. On May 15, Gallant convened a press conference in which he criticized Netanyahu for rejecting dealing with the post war issue in the Gaza Strip. Gallant called on Netanyahu to announce that Israel would not control Gaza, and expressed his opposition to a Israeli civilian and military government in the Strip. His remarks drew criticism from coalition and opposition figures, and were supported by the leader of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz.\nOn 24 July, Netanyahu outlined his vision for the post-war Gaza Strip before the US Congress: \"A demilitarized Gaza free of weapons and extremism. We do not want to settle in Gaza, but we will have to maintain security responsibility there. It should be run by Palestinians who do not want to destroy Israel. A new generation of Palestinians should learn no more to hate Jews but to live in peace with us. After our victory, with the help of partners in the region, the demilitarization of Gaza and the end of extremism in Gaza, we can bring about a future of peace and prosperity.\"\nOn 2 April, Israel Katz announced the Israeli government's intention to \"seize large areas\" of Gaza as large air and ground operations resumed following the end of the March ceasefire. On 17 April, Katz said that Israeli forces would remain in areas of Gaza, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely. On 5 May, the Israeli cabinet approved plans to capture the entire Gaza Strip and occupy it for an unspecified amount of time. Far-right Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich said that Gaza would be \"entirely destroyed\" in Israel's new offensive and that the population would be expelled to other countries.\nOn 8 August 2025, the Security Cabinet approved five principles for ending the war, including disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, maintaining Israeli security control over it, and establishing an alternative civilian government not affiliated with Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. Smotrich then withdrew confidence in Netanyahu's war leadership, criticizing his Gaza strategy as weak and calling for a decisive military victory over Hamas.\n\n\n=== Donald Trump's proposal ===\n\nAfter the announcement of a second ceasefire in January 2025, Donald Trump announced his intention to displace the Palestinian population of Gaza, reiterating his position that they should be resettled in neighboring Arab countries three more times that month. Ahead of a 4 February meeting with Netanyahu, Trump specified his intention to permanently displace Gaza's Palestinian inhabitants, which would be in violation of international law. He proposed a US takeover of Gaza that evening during a press conference with Netanyahu.\nTrump insisted that neighboring countries would pay for Gaza's reconstruction and that \"world people\" would live there. He did not rule out deploying US troops if necessary. On 5 and 6 February, Trump aides and Trump himself walked back some of his comments, including his willingness to deploy US soldiers. On 10 February, Trump said that Palestinians who leave Gaza would have no right of return. In a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan, Trump said that the US would take rather than buy Gaza because \"It's a war torn area. It's Gaza. There is nothing to buy.\" Trump had proposed Jordan take in the displaced Palestinians from Gaza, which Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi categorically rejected, stating \"They don't want to come to Jordan and we don't want them to come to Jordan.\"\nTrump's statements were met with condemnation from world leaders; however, in Israel, far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir praised Trump, saying that Palestinian \"migration\" was the only solution to the war. Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir characterized the planned displacement of Gazans as a \"voluntary migration\", but communications minister Shlomo Karhi said the transfer will be forced rather than voluntary.\nTrump has rejected the Arab League plan claiming that \"The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,\" and that the Trump administration will go ahead with seizing the territory \"to bring peace and prosperity to the region\".\nIn May 2025, US special envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a ceasefire in Gaza. This proposal reportedly included a 60-day truce, freeing of 28 hostages, release of over 1000 Palestinian prisoners and supply of humanitarian aid. Israel accepted the proposal. Hamas requested amendments to the plan and reiterated calls for the complete withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza.\n\n\n=== Arab League proposal ===\nArab governments rejected Trump's transfer plan, instead backing an Egyptian proposal. The Arab League, meeting on 4 March in Cairo, devised a $53 billion plan detailing the reconstruction of Gaza while keeping its population in place. The proposal also included the requirement that Hamas disarm, step down and fresh elections to a reformed Palestinian Authority be held. Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune boycotted the league meeting claiming that it was \"monopolized by a limited and narrow group of Arab countries\". Hamas also reiterated that the group's arms were non-negotiable and rejected the plan.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nIn March 2025, the United States and Israel said they have contacted officials from Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, Syria, Morocco, Puntland, and Somaliland to discuss the resettlement of Gaza residents in their territories. Egypt, Jordan, and Sudan, rejected the proposal while Somalia and Somaliland denied that they had been contacted. In May 2025, reports emerged that the Trump administration was working on a plan to permanently relocate 1 million Gazans to Libya, while offering the release of around $30 billion in funds frozen by the US since the toppling of the regime of Muammar Gaddafi in exchange for Libyan authorities agreeing to the deal. In August 2025, reports suggested that Nethanyahu was in talks with South Sudan to discuss the resettlement of Gaza residents. The plan allegedly involved Israel, USA and the UAE's backing and would see financial and diplomatic support. Reports stated that the South Sudanese cabinet actually agreed to the deal, but it fell short in parliament and other parts of the South Sudanese government. South Sudan rejected the reports and its ministry of foreign affairs released a statement denying holding talks with Israel about the relocation of Palestinians, calling the reports \"baseless\", and said they do not reflect the policies of South Sudan.\nOn 9 April, French president Emmanuel Macron said that France could recognize a Palestinian state by June, adding that he wanted to be part of a collective dynamic where those who defend Palestine also recognize Israel in turn.\n\n\n== Spillover ==\n\nThe war's spillover has resulted in a major escalation of existing tensions between Israel and Iran, with groups in the Axis of Resistance launching attacks on American military bases, and the Yemeni Houthi movement attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea and incurring a US-led military operation. Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and the Houthi movement in Yemen launched attacks against Israel shortly after the start of the war. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have also traded attacks with the US and IDF.\nIsrael has bombed targets in and around Damascus throughout the war, with an attack on the Iranian embassy in Damascus on 1 April 2024 leading to a series of retaliatory airstrikes on Israel in response. On 31 July, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, where he had traveled to attend the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian, and on 1 October, Iran fired approximately 200 missiles at Israel.\nBy the end of 2024, a year-long exchange of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah escalated into an Israeli invasion of Lebanon, before it was paused after a ceasefire. Under the November 2024 agreement, Israeli forces were to withdraw from Lebanon by January 2025, but Israel refused and the deadline was extended to February 2025, where Israel withdrew its forces from Lebanese villages but kept Israeli forces maintaining five military outposts on highlands in Southern Lebanon, against Lebanon's wishes. The crisis has also seen the fall of the Assad regime and an ongoing Israeli invasion of Syria. Israeli defense minister Israel Katz in April 2025 declared that Israeli forces would indefinitely remain in \"security zones\" that they \"cleared and seized\" in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.\n\n\n=== West Bank and Israel ===\n\nAmnesty International released a report on 5 February 2024 stating that Israel is carrying out unlawful killings in the West Bank and displaying \"a chilling disregard for Palestinian lives\" and that Israeli forces are carrying out numerous illegal acts of violence that constitute clear violations of international law.\nBefore the war, 2023 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in 20 years. Violence in the West Bank has increased since the war began with more than 607 Palestinians and over 25 Israelis killed. At the same time, Israeli settler violence further increased to around 1,270 attacks, against 856 for all of 2022. About 1,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settlers since 7 October and almost half of the clashes have included \"Israeli forces accompanying or actively supporting Israeli settlers while carrying out the attacks\" according to a U.N. report. According to the West Bank Protection Consortium, since the 7 October attacks six Palestinian communities have been abandoned due to the violence.\nOn 19 October, more than 60 Hamas members were arrested and 12 people were killed in overnight Israeli raids across the West Bank. Those arrested included the movement's spokesperson in the West Bank, Hassan Yousef.\nIn July, Israeli authorities approved the seizure of 12.7 square kilometers of land in the occupied West Bank. According to Peace Now, this was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords.\" Israeli authorities also approved plans for almost 5,300 new houses in occupied West Bank. By July 2024, Israeli land seizures exceeded the combined total of the previous 20 years. The following month, the Israeli government approved new settlements in the occupied West Bank, and it was reported that Israeli settlers had taken advantage of the ongoing war to expand settlement activity supported by a far-right Israeli government, including land seizure and large scale settlement plans.\nOn 7 August, Wafa reported that Israeli forces destroyed the regional headquarters of Fatah in the Balata Camp. On 28 August, Israel launched the largest military operation into the northern West Bank in more than 20 years. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that the operation was a \"full-fledged war\". Israeli forces carried out simultaneous operations in Jenin, Tubas, Nablus, Ramallah and Tulkarem. In Jenin, Israeli forces destroyed the city's infrastructure and carried out mass arrests of men and boys. Civilians were trapped in their homes and denied access to food, water and medicine. Members of the press were denied access to the city and the army blocked access to hospitals and ambulances. A day later, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for a halt to the operations, and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the operations \"must not constitute the premises of a war extension from Gaza, including full-scale destruction.\" On 3 September, Israeli media reported that the IDF had classified the West Bank as a \"combat zone\" and now viewed it as the second most important front in the war. Yoav Gallant said that Israel was \"mowing the lawn\" with its West Bank operations, but that it would eventually need to \"pull out the roots\". On 6 September, Turkish-American protestor Ayşenur Eygi was killed by an Israeli sniper at a demonstration near Nablus.\nOn 3 October, an Israeli airstrike in Tulkarm Camp killed at least 20 people. On 13 November, Israeli far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said that with Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 United States presidential election, Israel was \"a step away\" from \"sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.\" Later comments by Mike Huckabee, chosen by Trump as the next ambassador to Israel, corroborated the possibility of an Israeli annexation of the West Bank. On 21 January 2025, the IDF said it launched a major raid in West Bank. On 29 January, the IDF said that it conducted a drone strike targeting a group of militants in Tammun, killing at least 10 people.\n\n\n==== Attacks in Israel ====\nOn 30 November, two Palestinian gunmen killed three and wounded 11 Israeli civilians at a bus stop on the Givat Shaul Interchange in Jerusalem. Hamas claimed responsibility. On 16 February 2024, a Palestinian gunman shot and killed two Israeli civilians and injured four others in Kiryat Malakhi, Israel. The shooter was killed by an off-duty IDF reservist at the scene. On 12 April, a 14-year-old Israeli shepherd went missing near Ramallah and was found dead a day later. On 15 April, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli settlers in Aqraba. On 13 May, at the Tarqumiya checkpoint, a convoy of trucks carrying food supplies to Gaza was attacked by Israeli settlers, who damaged the trucks and threw supplies on the ground.\n\n\n==== Israeli prisons and detention camps ====\n\nIsrael has increased its administrative detention of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Palestinian citizens of Israel, since the start of the war. Administrative detention was already at a 20-year high before October 2023. More than 11,000 Palestinians are held in Israeli jails, not counting detainees taken from Gaza during the war. At least 60 Palestinians have died in Israeli detention since 7 October. They are held without charge or trial, which violates international law.\nIn December 2023, a military base at Sde Teiman in the Negev Desert was converted to a detention camp by the IDF. Whistleblowers and detainees reported beatings and torture of Palestinian detainees at the camp, as well as amputations of limbs due to injuries sustained from handcuffing, medical neglect, arbitrary punishment and sexual abuse. Prisoners have been coerced to make confessions that they are members of Hamas. After conditions in the camp came to light in May 2024, the Supreme Court of Israel held a hearing and the IDF began transferring 1,200 of the prisoners to Ofer Prison. Detainees have reported severe instances of violence during transfers between prisons.\nSeveral Palestinian healthcare workers have been abducted from Gaza hospitals during sieges by Israeli forces. On 5 December, Israeli forces abducted the adult men present at Al-Awda hospital and took them to Sde Teiman camp. Dr. Adnan Al-Bursh was detained and later died in Israeli custody. In March, Israeli forces abducted Khaled Alser, lead author of the first Lancet paper on trauma among Gazan ER patients and doctors, from Nasser Hospital. As of 31 August, he remains in detention and his whereabouts are unknown.\nAl-Araby TV correspondent Mohammed Arab was abducted from the Gaza strip in March 2024 and transferred to Ofer prison in July. After reports of his treatment were leaked to al-Araby, he was beaten, threatened and tortured. According to Arab's testimony, prison guards used dogs and fire extinguishers to enact sexual violence on other prisoners.\nIn July 2024, military police raided Sde Teiman to arrest ten soldiers \"suspected of the serious sexual abuse\" of a Palestinian detainee. Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and other members of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party condemned the arrests. Supporters of the arrested soldiers including Ben Gvir, Amihai Eliyahu, Zvi Sukkot, and Nissim Vaturi stormed Sde Teiman that night in protest. Hours later, protestors broke into Beit Lid where the soldiers were being held.\nAs of February 2025, at least 160 healthcare workers from Gaza were believed to be held in detention by Israel, with another 24 missing after being taken from hospitals in Gaza. Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammed Abu Selmia, who was detained for 7 months and released without charges, detailed many of the abuses he faced and said that \"no day passes without torture\" in Israeli prisons.\n\n\n=== American involvement ===\n\nThe extent of American support for Israel has led the war to be labelled by Le Monde journalist Gilbert Achcar as 'the first US-Israeli joint war'. Alongside substantial military, financial, and diplomatic support, the US also intervened in the war directly. 100 American soldiers were deployed in combat to man a THAAD anti-air battery. In addition, America piloted drones over Gaza in order to provide intelligence to Israel. This intelligence was aimed at locating Palestinian militant leaders in Gaza and the location of hostages; this also included information on Sinwar's location.\nOn 18 March 2025, after Israel's surprise attack on the Gaza Strip, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer stated that the operation had \"fully coordinated with Washington\" and thanked the Trump administration \"for their unyielding support for Israel\". On 6 April, a second THAAD system was deployed to Israel by the US.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\n\nAs of 27 August 2025, over 65,000 people (63,888 Palestinians and 1,983 Israelis) have been reported killed in the Gaza war according to the Gaza Health Ministry (GHM) and Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as 217 journalists and media workers, 120 academics, and over 224 humanitarian aid workers, a number that includes 179 employees of UNRWA. Scholars have estimated 80% of Palestinians killed are civilians. A study by OHCHR, which verified fatalities from three independent sources, found that 70% of the Palestinians killed in residential buildings or similar housing were women and children. \nThe majority of casualties have been in the Gaza Strip. The GHM total casualty count is the number of deaths directly caused by the war. The demographic breakdown is a subset of those individually identified. On 17 September 2024, the GHM published the names, gender and birth date of 34,344 individual Palestinians whose identities were confirmed and continues to attempt to identify all casualties. The GHM count does not include those who have died from \"preventable disease, malnutrition and other consequences of the war\". An analysis by the Gaza Health Projections Working Group predicted thousands of excess deaths from disease and birth complications. \nIn January 2025, a peer-reviewed analysis of deaths in the Gaza war between October 2023 and 30 June 2024 was published in The Lancet. The paper estimated 64,260 deaths from traumatic injury during this period, and likely exceeding 70,000 by October 2024, with 59.1% of them being women, children and the elderly. It concluded that the GHM undercounted trauma-related deaths by 41% in its report, and also noted that its findings \"underestimate the full impact of the military operation in Gaza, as they do not account for non-trauma-related deaths resulting from health service disruption, food insecurity, and inadequate water and sanitation.\" A comparable figure for May 2025 would be 93,000 (77,000 to 109,000), representing 4–5% of Gaza's pre-war population.\nA survey by PCPSR reported showed over 60% of Gazans have lost family members since the war began. Thousands of more dead bodies are thought to be under the rubble of destroyed buildings. The number of injured is greater than 100,000; Gaza has the most amputated children per capita in the world.\nThe 7 October attacks on Israel killed 1,195 people, including 815 civilians. Casualties have also occurred in other parts of Israel, as well as in southern Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iran.\nAccording to the Israeli Ministry of Defense's Rehabilitation Division, about 1,000 soldiers are wounded every month. On 14 August 2024, the ministry predicted that it would have to account for 100,000 disabled IDF veterans by 2030 due to the war.\nAn investigation by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call found that, in May 2025, figures from a classified IDF database listed 8,900 Palestinian fighters as dead or likely dead, or 17% of the 53,000 death toll at the time, indicating that 83% of the dead were civilians‪—a rate higher only in the Srebrenica massacre (though not the Bosnian war overall), the siege of Mariupol, and the Rwandan genocide. In response, the IDF said that the numbers in the article are incorrect.\n\n\n== Humanitarian crisis ==\n\nThe Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian crisis as a result of the war, including a hunger crisis, in which famine-like conditions occurred in some areas of the strip and a high risk of famine persists as of October 2024, as well as a healthcare collapse. At the start of the war, Israel tightened its blockade on the strip, resulting in significant shortages of fuel, food, medication, water, and essential medical supplies. This siege resulted in a 90% drop in electricity availability, impacting hospital power supplies, sewage plants, and shutting down the desalination plants that provide drinking water. In July 2024, available water worked out to 4.74 litres per person per day, just under a third of the recommended minimum in emergencies. Doctors warned of disease outbreaks spreading due to overcrowded hospitals. A polio epidemic was the target of mostly-successful vaccination campaigns.\n\nHeavy bombardment by Israeli airstrikes caused catastrophic damage to Gaza's infrastructure, further deepening the crisis. Direct attacks on telecommunications infrastructure by Israel, electricity blockades, and fuel shortages caused the near-total collapse of Gaza's largest cell network providers. Lack of internet access has obstructed Gazan citizens from communicating with loved ones, learning of IDF operations, and identifying both the areas most exposed to bombing and possible escape routes. The blackouts impeded emergency services, making it harder to locate and access the time-critical injured, and have impeded humanitarian aid agencies and journalists. By December 2023, 200,000 Gazans (approximately 10% of the population) had received internet access through an eSIM provided by Connecting Humanity.The Gaza Health Ministry reported over 4,000 children killed in the war's first month. UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that Gaza had \"become a graveyard for children.\" Indirect Palestinian deaths are expected to be much higher due to the intensity of the conflict, destruction of healthcare infrastructure, lack of food, water, shelter, and safe places for civilians to flee to, and reduction in UNRWA funding, with a Lancet non peer-reviewed correspondence estimating that the death toll in Gaza, including future deaths indirectly caused by the war, may exceed 186,000.\nIn mid-April 2025, 12 CEOs of humanitarian organizations signed a statement that aid systems were in danger of collapsing. On 16 May, Donald Trump acknowledged starvation in Gaza and promoted a US-Israeli humanitarian aid plan where food would be distributed through a system of hubs run by private contractors and protected by Israeli soldiers. The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was set up to carry out this plan and announced it would be ready to begin operations by the end of May. International aid agencies have rejected US-Israeli aid plans, saying that they weaponize humanitarian aid, violate principles of neutrality, will exacerbate mass displacement and would not be able to meet the scale of aid that is required.\nOn 25 May, the UN's World Food Programme Executive Director Cindy McCain said only about 100 trucks a day were getting through, whereas prior to the blockade it had been upwards of 600 trucks a day. USAID had concluded that in the majority of cases of theft of food aid, the perpetuators could not be identified, although there was no evidence of the widespread diversion by Hamas.\nIn July 2025, UN Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher said not enough \"lorries\" (trucks) of food aid were getting through. For example on July 27, 110 trucks entered Gaza, whereas during the two-month ceasefire earlier in 2025 the volume of aid trucks was more in the range of 600 to 700 trucks a day. Trump said Gaza is experiencing \"real starvation\", while Netanyahu blamed Hamas. Projections show 100% of the population in Gaza is experiencing \"high levels of acute food insecurity\", with about 20% experiencing catastrophic levels as of July 2025.\nIn August 2025, an IPC analysis confirmed famine, or IPC Phase 5, in some parts of Gaza including Gaza City. In addition, this analysis predicted that between mid-August and September 30, 2025, an additional 640,000 persons are expected to face Phase 5 conditions. Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories issued a counter-report which it said refuted the contents of the IPC brief.\n\n\n== Scale of destruction ==\n\nThe scale and pace of destruction and damage of buildings in the Gaza Strip ranks among the most severe in modern history, surpassing the bombing of Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined during World War II, and included apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, religious sites, factories, shopping centers, and municipal infrastructure. As of January 2024, researchers at Oregon State University and the City University of New York estimated that 50–62% of buildings in the Gaza Strip had been damaged or destroyed. The damage to buildings in northern Gaza reportedly exceeds that in Bakhmut and Mariupol in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Aleppo in the Battle of Aleppo, and Mosul and Raqqa in the War against the Islamic State. The 29,000 munitions Israel had dropped on Gaza in three months exceeded the amount (3,678) dropped by the US between 2004 and 2010 after its invasion of Iraq. According to satellite analyses, 68% of roads, 70% of greenhouses, and nearly 70% of tree crops have been damaged or destroyed. After a year, the UN estimates that a total of 42m tonnes of rubble clutter the Strip, to clear and rebuild which might take 80 years and cost over $80bn.\nThe Guardian reported that the scale of destruction has led international legal experts to raise the concept of domicide, which it describes as \"the mass destruction of dwellings to make [a] territory uninhabitable\". The term urbicide has also been used to refer to the destruction of Gazan cities and their institutions. In October 2024, after monitoring and analyzing Israel's war conduct in Gaza for more than a year, Forensic Architecture published a cartographic map platform detailing Israel's campaign in Gaza titled \"A Cartography of Genocide\", accompanied by an 827-page text report that concludes that \"Israel's military campaign in Gaza is organised, systematic, and intended to destroy conditions of life and life-sustaining infrastructure\".\n\n\n== War crimes ==\n\nA UN Commission to the Israel–Palestine conflict stated that there is \"clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed in the latest explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza, and all those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable.\" On 27 October, a spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called for an independent court to review potential war crimes committed by both sides.\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) said that its mandate to investigate alleged war crimes committed since June 2014 in the State of Palestine extends to the current conflict. On 20 May, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan announced his intention to seek arrest warrants against Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war. On 21 November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, and Deif for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The ICC canceled Deif's arrest warrant after confirming his death.\nOn 7 June 2024, both Israel and Hamas were added to the list of shame, an annex attached to an annual report submitted by the UN Secretary-General documenting rights violations against children in armed conflict. While past reports accused Israel of grave rights violations against children, the country was never included in the annex.\nOn 19 June 2024, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory presented a detailed report to the United Nations Human Rights Council covering the war from 7 October to 31 December 2023, affirming that both Hamas and Israel committed war crimes and that Israel's actions also constituted crimes against humanity. In a second report, the Commission found that Israel had carried out a policy of destroying Gaza's healthcare system.\nThe June report found that the military wing of Hamas and six other Palestinian armed groups were responsible for the war crimes of intentionally directing attacks against civilians, murder or willful killing, torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, destroying or seizing property, outrages upon personal dignity, and taking hostages, including children. In relation to IDF operations and attacks in Gaza, the commission concluded that Israeli authorities are responsible for the war crimes of starvation as a method of warfare, murder or willful killing, intentionally directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects, forcible transfer, sexual violence, torture and inhuman or cruel treatment, arbitrary detention and outrages upon personal dignity. It also found that Israel committed numerous crimes against humanity, including carrying out the extermination of Palestinians and gender persecution targeting Palestinian men and boys. The commission said that they had submitted 7,000 pieces of evidence to the ICC related to crimes committed by Israel and Hamas, as part of the International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine.\nIn another report published in October 2024, the commission accused Israel of \"committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities\" as well as accusing the IDF of deliberately killing and torturing medical personnel, targeting medical vehicles, and restricting patients from leaving Gaza. The report also addressed the detention of Palestinians in Israeli military camps and facilities, finding that thousands of child and adult detainees, many arbitrarily detained, faced widespread abuse, including physical and psychological violence, rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence, and conditions amounting to torture, highlighting that deaths resulting from such abuse or neglect constituted war crimes and violations of the right to life. Israel refused to cooperate with the investigation, contending that it had an \"anti-Israel\" bias.\nOn 5 December 2024, Amnesty International published a report concluding that Israel was committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip; and on 19 December 2024, Human Rights Watch published a 179-page report concluding that Israel is responsible for the crime of genocide by intentionally depriving Palestinians in Gaza of access to safe water for drinking and sanitation needed for basic human survival.\nOn 13 March 2025, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory released a report stating that Israel's attacks on women's healthcare facilities in Gaza amounted to genocidal acts, destroying \"in part the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group\". Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the report as \"false and absurd\", and accused UN Human Rights Council of being anti-Israel and anti-Semitic.\nOn 13 July 2025, Brazilian minister of foreign relations Mauro Vieira announced that Brazil would officially join South Africa's ICJ case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. On 28 July 2025, Israeli human rights groups B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights–Israel released reports calling Israel's campaign in Gaza a genocide. The B'Tselem report also claimed that European and US leaders were enabling the genocide. Various genocide studies and international law scholars have also said that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\n\n\n== Diplomatic impact ==\n\nThe war sparked a diplomatic crisis, with countries around the world reacting strongly to the conflict, that affected the momentum of regional relations. At least nine countries withdrew their ambassadors or cut diplomatic ties with Israel. The war has also resulted in a renewed focus on a two-state solution to the broader conflict. Global public opinion of Israel dropped during the war; a Morning Consult poll published in January 2024 indicated that the United States was the only remaining wealthy country in which Israel had net positive approval.\nNegotiations have focused on the possibility of a ceasefire, with the US, Egypt and Qatar serving as negotiation mediators between Israel and Hamas. The United Nations Security Council passed resolution 2728 in March 2024, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages for the month of Ramadan. The United Nations Security Council passed resolution 2735 in June 2024, calling for acceptance of the three-phase ceasefire proposal.\nFollowing talks mediated by China, on 23 July 2024, Palestinian groups including Hamas and Fatah reached an agreement to end their divisions and form a unity government for Gaza, which they announced in the Beijing Declaration.\nAt the UNGA, Saudi Arabia announced a global alliance to push for a two-state solution. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said almost 90 countries were at the launch of The Global Alliance for the Implementation of a Palestinian State and a Two-State Solution. On 29 September, Saudi Arabia said they would send aid to the Palestinian Authority, $60 million in six installments according to a senior PA official. The aid is seen as means of keeping the PA solvent and maintaining the push for a two-state solution, notwithstanding Israeli financial restrictions.\nOn 9 August 2025, the Qatari Prime Minister met with U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff regarding a potential deal for the return of all hostages, living and dead, in return for an end to the war. The meeting is towards making \"workable\" a joint Egyptian-Qatari proposal. The Director of Israel's spy agency Mossad traveled to Qatar on 14 August for negotiations. In addition to Qatar and Egypt, Turkey is also involved in negotiations to end the war.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Israel ===\n\nThe Israeli government's response to the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel has multiple aspects, including a military response leading to the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. In October, the Knesset approved a war cabinet in Israel, adding National Unity ministers and altering the government; Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz froze non-war legislation, establishing a war cabinet with military authority.\nSettler expansions and officials' remarks heightened unrest, leading to protests within Israel. The Knesset's law criminalizing \"terrorist materials\" consumption drew criticism.\nIn an interview to the Wall Street Journal on 25 December, Netanyahu said that Israel's objectives were to \"destroy Hamas, demilitarize Gaza and deradicalize the whole of Palestinian society\".\nThere was broad support in Israeli society for military operations in Gaza. A public opinion poll conducted in December 2023 by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 87% of Jewish Israelis supported the war in Gaza.\nIn another Israel Democracy Institute survey of 510 Israeli citizens in early February 2024, 68% of respondents supported preventing all international aid from entering Gaza.\nA poll commissioned by Penn State University and conducted in March 2025 among a representative sample of 1,005 Israeli Jews found that 82% supported the forced expulsion of Gaza residents. Additionally, 47% responded affirmatively to the question: \"When conquering an enemy city, should the IDF act like the Israelites led by Joshua when they conquered Jericho, that is, kill all its inhabitants?\"\n\n\n=== Occupied Palestinian territories ===\nInitially, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas asserted the Palestinian people's right to self-defense against the \"terror of settlers and occupation troops\" and condemned the orders by Israel for residents to evacuate north Gaza, labeling it a \"second Nakba\". Later, Abbas rejected the killing of civilians on both sides, and said that the Palestinian Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinian people.\nA December 2023 poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that 72% of respondents (52% of Gazans and 85% of West Bank residents) approved of the October 7 attacks. A 2024 follow-up poll found that two-thirds of respondents continued to approve of the attacks. About 90% of respondents did not believe that Hamas committed atrocities (killing women and children, sexual violence) during the October 7 attacks, seeing this as enemy propaganda. Half of respondents in Gaza expected Hamas to win the war, while a quarter expected Israel to win.\n\n\n=== International ===\n\nSignificant geopolitical divisions emerged during the war. Israel's traditional Western allies provided diplomatic backing and weaponry to Israel; including the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. However several European nations have been less supportive of Israel's actions, most notably Spain, Norway, and Ireland who formally recognized the State of Palestine in a coordinated move in June 2024. Spain and Ireland have also supported South Africa's genocide case against Israel. This has led to retaliatory action by Israel, who recalled its ambassadors to all three countries and later announced that it would be closing its embassy in Dublin. At least 44 nations denounced Hamas and explicitly condemned its conduct on 7 October as terrorism, including a joint statement by the US, UK, France, Italy, and Germany.\nIn contrast, the Islamic world and much of the Global South denounced the actions of Israel and its allies, criticizing the \"moral authority of the West\" and alleging that it holds double standards surrounding human rights. The double standards, in their view, is condemning Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukrainian land while standing firmly behind Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. Bolivia has cut all ties with Israel as a result of the conflict, while Colombia and Chile recalled their ambassadors to the country.\nThe United States and Germany have supplied Israel with substantial military and medical aid. The United Kingdom issues licenses for British companies to sell weapons to Israel, supplying less than 1% of Israel's military imports. In September 2024, the UK suspended some military exports to Israel because there was a \"clear risk\" they might be used to violate international law.\nThe Israeli government's response prompted international protests, arrests, and harassment.\n\n\n=== Evacuations of foreign nationals ===\n\nBrazil announced a rescue operation of nationals using an air force transport aircraft. Poland announced that it would deploy two C-130 transport planes to evacuate 200 Polish nationals. Hungary evacuated 215 of its nationals from Israel using two aircraft on 9 October, while Romania evacuated 245 of its citizens, including two pilgrimage groups, on two TAROM planes and two private aircraft on the same day. Australia also announced repatriation flights. 300 Nigerian pilgrims in Israel fled to Jordan before being airlifted home.\nOn 12 October, the United Kingdom arranged flights for its citizens in Israel; the first plane departed Ben Gurion Airport that day. The government had said before that it would not be evacuating its nationals due to available commercial flights. However, most commercial flights were suspended. Nepal arranged a flight to evacuate at least 254 of its citizens who were studying in Israel. India launched Operation Ajay to evacuate its citizens from Israel. Ukraine facilitated the evacuation of ~450 of its citizens from Israel as of 18 October, with additional evacuation flights planned for the near future.\n\n\n== Impacts ==\n\n\n=== Regional impact ===\nAccording to Daniel Byman and Alexander Palmer, the attack showcased the decline of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the rise of Hamas as a power center in Palestinian politics. They predicted the PLO's further decline if the status quo held. Laith Alajlouni wrote that the immediate effect of the Hamas offensive was to unite Hamas and PLO.\nAmit Segal, chief political commentator for Israel's Channel 12, said that the conflict would test Benjamin Netanyahu's survival as prime minister, noting that past wars had toppled the governments of several of his predecessors such as that of Golda Meir following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Menachem Begin following the 1982 Lebanon War, and Ehud Olmert following the 2006 Lebanon War. Citing the Israeli intelligence failure, which some observers attributed to the incumbent government focusing more on internal dissent, the judicial reform, and efforts to deepen Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories, some commentators criticized Netanyahu for putting aside the PLO and propping up Hamas, and described him as a liability.\nIn an analysis by The Times of Israel, the newspaper wrote, \"Hamas has violently shifted the world's eyes back to the Palestinians and dealt a severe blow to the momentum for securing a landmark US-brokered deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\" Andreas Kluth wrote in his Bloomberg News column that Hamas \"torched Biden's deal to remake the Middle East\", arguing that the deal that was being discussed between Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the US would have left Palestinians in the cold, so the group decided to \"blow the whole thing up\". He added that viewed from Gaza, things were only going to get worse, considering that Netanyahu's coalition partners opposed a two-state solution. He suggested they would prefer to annex the entirety of the West Bank, even at the expense of turning Israel into an apartheid state.\n\n\n=== Economic impact ===\n\nThe Bank of Israel estimates that by 2025, the war will have cost the country US$67 billion, notwithstanding a $14.5 billion US aid package, part of the $22.76 billion the US has so far allocated for military assistance.\nAs early as 9 November 2023, the Bank of Israel reported that the drop in labor supply caused by the war was costing the Israeli economy $600 million a week, or 6% of weekly GDP. The bank also stated that the estimate did not include damage caused by the absence of Palestinian and foreign workers. In the final quarter of 2023, the Israeli economy shrank by 5.2% quarter-to-quarter due to labor shortages in construction and from the mobilization of 300,000 reservists. While Israel did still see economic growth of 2%, this was down from 6.5% growth in the year before the war. Consumer spending declined by 27%, imports declined by 42% and exports declined by 18%.\nIsrael's high-tech factories reported in December that recent bureaucratic obstacles with electronic imports from China had led to higher import costs and delayed delivery times. Israeli officials also reported that China had refused to send workers to their country during the war against the backdrop of a worker shortage in Israel's construction and farming sectors. China's actions were described as a de facto sanction.\nThe 3,500-member Water Transport Workers Federation of India said it would refuse to operate shipments carrying weapons to Israel. The declaration came a few months after one Indian company halted production of Israeli police uniforms due to the war in Gaza.\nAbout 9,855 Thai workers in the agricultural sector, 4,331 workers in the construction sector and 2,997 in the nursing sector left Israel following the 7 October attack. In addition, the prevention of 85,000 Palestinian workers from entering Israel created a shortage of about 100,000 foreign and Palestinian workers.\nIt has been calculated that the carbon cost in terms of climate impact of rebuilding Gaza would exceed the annual greenhouse emissions of 135 countries.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nThe report from the IDF in August 2025 indicated that the rise in fatalities among its soldiers was due to suicide, psychological trauma resulting from the prolonged conflict, and the distressing experiences encountered during the war.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\n\nIn reporting on the conflict, foreign media have limited access to Gaza and only in the presence of Israeli soldiers. Vox reported that the news organizations \"have to submit all materials and footage to the IDF for review before publication\". The conflict has also seen large numbers of journalists wounded or killed in action. On 14 December, CBS reported on a statement from the International Federation of Journalists that \"the number of journalists killed in the past two months in the war in Gaza has surpassed the amount killed in the Vietnam War, which lasted two decades\". Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court under section 8.2.b of the Rome Statute, accusing Israel of committing war crimes against eight journalists. It also lodged a complaint against Hamas under section 8.2.a of the Rome Statute for the killing of a reporter covering the 7 October attack. The Committee to Protect Journalists accused Israel of targeting journalists reporting from Gaza and their families, saying that in at least two cases, \"journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and Israel Defense Forces officers before their family members were killed\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nMisinformation in the Gaza war\nOutline of the Gaza war\nDo you condemn Hamas?\nList of modern conflicts in the Middle East\nList of wars involving Israel\nList of wars involving Palestine\nTimeline of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in 2023\nTimeline of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in 2024\nTimeline of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in 2025\nList of companies involved in the Gaza war\nIsraeli plan to take control of Gaza City\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nIsrael–Hamas war at the Encyclopædia Britannica\nIsrael–Hamas war at Google News\nHostilities in Gaza and Israel, Humanitarian Situation Updates, OCHA.\nMonthly Bulletin (Action by UN System and IGOs Relevant to Question of Palestine), UNRWA\nSwords of Iron, Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",

        "title": "Limonene",
        "content": "Limonene () is a colorless liquid aliphatic hydrocarbon classified as a cyclic monoterpene, and is the major component in the essential oil of citrus fruit peels. The (+)-isomer, occurring more commonly in nature as the fragrance of oranges, is a flavoring agent in food manufacturing. It is also used in chemical synthesis as a precursor to carvone and as a renewables-based solvent in cleaning products. The less common (−)-isomer has a piny, turpentine-like odor, and is found in the edible parts of such plants as caraway, dill, and bergamot orange plants.\nLimonene takes its name from Italian limone (\"lemon\"). Limonene is a chiral molecule, and biological sources produce one enantiomer: the principal industrial source, citrus fruit, contains (+)-limonene (d-limonene), which is the (R)-enantiomer.  (+)-Limonene is obtained commercially from citrus fruits through two primary methods: centrifugal separation or steam distillation.\n\n\n== In plants ==\n\n(+)-Limonene is a major component of the aromatic scents and resins characteristic of numerous coniferous and broadleaved trees: red and silver maple (Acer rubrum, Acer saccharinum), cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia), aspens (Populus grandidentata, Populus tremuloides) sumac (Rhus glabra), spruce (Picea spp.), various pines (e.g., Pinus echinata, Pinus ponderosa), Pinus leucodermis, Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), larches (Larix spp.), true firs (Abies spp.), hemlocks (Tsuga spp.), cedars (Cedrus spp.), various Cupressaceae, and juniper bush (Juniperus spp.). It contributes to the characteristic odor of orange peel, orange juice and other citrus fruits. To optimize recovery of valued components from citrus peel waste, (+)-limonene is typically removed.\n\n\n== Chemical reactions ==\nLimonene is a relatively stable monoterpene and can be distilled without decomposition, although at elevated temperatures it cracks to form isoprene.  It oxidizes easily in moist air to produce carveol, carvone, and limonene oxide. With sulfur, it undergoes dehydrogenation to p-cymene.\nLimonene occurs commonly as the (R)-enantiomer, but racemizes at 300 °C. When warmed with mineral acid, limonene isomerizes to the conjugated diene α-terpinene (which can also easily be converted to p-cymene). Evidence for this isomerization includes the formation of Diels–Alder adducts between α-terpinene adducts and maleic anhydride.\nIt is possible to effect reaction at one of the double bonds selectively. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride reacts preferentially at the disubstituted alkene, whereas epoxidation with mCPBA occurs at the trisubstituted alkene.\nIn another synthetic method Markovnikov addition of trifluoroacetic acid followed by hydrolysis of the acetate gives terpineol.\nThe most widely practiced conversion of limonene is to carvone. The three-step reaction begins with the regioselective addition of nitrosyl chloride across the trisubstituted double bond. This species is then converted to the oxime with a base, and the hydroxylamine is removed to give the ketone-containing carvone.\n\n\n=== Biosynthesis ===\nIn nature, limonene is formed from geranyl pyrophosphate, via cyclization of a neryl carbocation or its equivalent as shown. The final step involves loss of a proton from the cation to form the alkene.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nAs the main fragrance of citrus peels, D-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, such as a flavoring agent to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids, and as a fragrance in perfumery, aftershave lotions, bath products, and other personal care products. (+)-Limonene is also used as a botanical insecticide. (+)-Limonene is used in the organic herbicides. It is added to cleaning products, such as hand cleansers, to give a lemon or orange fragrance (see orange oil) and for its ability to dissolve oils. In contrast, (−)-limonene has a piny, turpentine-like odor.\nLimonene is used as a solvent for cleaning purposes, such as adhesive remover, or the removal of oil from machine parts, as it is produced from a renewable source (citrus essential oil, as a byproduct of orange juice manufacture). It is used as a paint stripper and is also useful as a fragrant alternative to turpentine. Limonene is also used as a solvent in some model airplane glues and as a constituent in some paints. Commercial air fresheners, with air propellants, containing limonene are used by stamp collectors to remove self-adhesive postage stamps from envelope paper.\nLimonene is also used as a solvent for fused filament fabrication based 3D printing. Printers can print the plastic of choice for the model, but erect supports and binders from high impact polystyrene (HIPS), a polystyrene plastic that is easily soluble in limonene.\nIn preparing tissues for histology or histopathology, D-limonene is often used as a less toxic substitute for xylene when clearing dehydrated specimens. Clearing agents are liquids miscible with alcohols (such as ethanol or isopropanol) and with melted paraffin wax, in which specimens are embedded to facilitate cutting of thin sections for microscopy. \nLimonene, from orange peel oil, is also combustible and has been considered as a biofuel.\n\n\n== Safety and research ==\nApplied to skin, limonene may cause irritation from contact dermatitis, but otherwise appears to be safe for human use. Limonene is flammable as a liquid or vapor and it is toxic to aquatic life.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\nThere is no evidence that the limonene in peel oils of citrus fruits affects the onset or progress of cancer, with one national agency stating, \"There is no consistent evidence that people with cancer who consume limonene—either in supplement form or by eating citrus fruits—get better or are more likely to be cured\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nEssential oil\nMonoterpenes\nResin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMass spectrum of limonene\nDescription of D-limonene on the International Chemical Safety Cards\nD-Limonene information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency",

        "title": "Murder of Meredith Kercher",
        "content": "Meredith Susanna Cara Kercher (28 December 1985 – 1 November 2007) was a British student on exchange from the University of Leeds who was murdered at the age of 21 in Perugia, Italy. Kercher was found dead on the floor of her room. By the time the bloodstained fingerprints at the scene were identified as belonging to Rudy Guede, an Ivorian migrant, police had charged Kercher's American roommate, Amanda Knox, and Knox's Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. The subsequent prosecutions of Knox and Sollecito received international publicity, with forensic experts and jurists taking a critical view of the evidence supporting the initial guilty verdicts.\nKnox and Sollecito were released after almost four years following their acquittal at a second-level trial. Knox immediately returned to the United States. Guede was tried separately in a fast-track procedure, and in October 2008 was found guilty of the sexual assault and murder of Kercher. He subsequently exhausted the appeals process and began serving a 16-year sentence. On 4 December 2020, an Italian court ruled that Guede could complete his term doing community service. Guede was released from prison on November 24, 2021.\nThe appeals verdicts of acquittal were declared null for \"manifest illogicalities\" by the Supreme Court of Cassation of Italy in 2013. The appeals trials had to be repeated; they took place in Florence, where the two were convicted again in 2014. The convictions of Knox and Sollecito were eventually quashed by the Supreme Court on 27 March 2015. The Supreme Court of Cassation invoked the provision of art. 530 § 2. of Italian Procedure Code (\"reasonable doubt\") and ordered that no further trial should be held, which resulted in their acquittal and the end of the case. The verdict pointed out that as scientific evidence was \"central\" to the case, there were \"sensational investigative failures\", \"amnesia\", and \"culpable omissions\" on the part of the investigating authorities.\n\n\n== Meredith Kercher ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nMeredith Susanna Cara Kercher (born 28 December 1985 in Southwark, South London), known to her friends as \"Mez\", lived in Coulsdon, South London. She was educated at the Old Palace School in Croydon. She was enthusiastic about the language and culture of Italy, and after a school exchange trip, she returned at age 15 to spend her summer vacation with a family in Sessa Aurunca.\nKercher studied European politics and Italian at the University of Leeds. Working as a barmaid, tour guide, and in promotions to support herself, she made a cameo appearance in the music video for Kristian Leontiou's song \"Some Say\" in 2004. She aspired to work for the European Union or as a journalist. In October 2007, she attended the University of Perugia, where she began courses in modern history, political theory, and the history of cinema. Fellow students later described her as caring, intelligent, witty, and popular.\n\n\n=== Via della Pergola 7 ===\nPerugia has a population of 150,000 people, of whom more than a quarter are students, many from abroad. In the city, Kercher shared a four-bedroom, first-floor flat in a house at Via della Pergola 7.\nHer flatmates were two Italian women in their late 20s, Filomena Romanelli and Laura Mezzetti, and a 20-year-old American student from the University of Washington, Amanda Knox, who was attending the University for Foreigners in Perugia on an exchange year. Kercher moved in on 10 September 2007, and Knox moved in on 20 September. Kercher typically called her mother daily on a mobile phone. A second mobile phone she used was registered to her flatmate, Romanelli.\nThe lower level of the house was occupied by four young Italian men with whom both Kercher and Knox were friendly. Kercher and Knox were out and away from their residence, late one night in mid-October. They returned home at 2:00 a.m., and met Rudy Guede. Guede had been invited into the lower-level flat by some of the Italian tenants. Kercher and Knox left at 4:30 a.m.\nKercher and Knox attended the EuroChocolate festival in mid-October. On 25 October they attended a classical music concert,  where Knox met Raffaele Sollecito, a 23-year-old computer science student, at the University of Perugia.\n\n\n=== Last sighting ===\nThe first of November (All Saints' Day) was a public holiday in Italy. Kercher's Italian flatmates, and the downstairs occupants, were out of town. Kercher had dinner with three English women at one of their homes on that evening. She parted company with a friend around 8:45 pm, about 500 yards (460 m) from Via della Pergola 7.\nKnox's account is that she spent the night with Sollecito, and returned to Via della Pergola 7 on the morning of 2 November 2007. She found the front door open. Drops of blood were in the bathroom that she shared with Kercher. Kercher's bedroom door was locked, and Knox guessed that Kercher was sleeping. Knox took a shower in the bathroom that she and Kercher shared. She found feces in the toilet of the bathroom of Romanelli and Mezzetti. She went back to Sollecito's home, and later returned with him to Via della Pergola 7. Sollecito noticed a broken window in Romanelli's bedroom. He was alarmed that Kercher did not answer her door, and tried unsuccessfully to force it open. He then called his sister, who was a lieutenant in the carabinieri, for advice. She advised him to call the 112 emergency number, which he did.\n\n\n=== Discovery of the body ===\nRomanelli arrived at the flat after receiving a telephone call from Knox. Romanelli inadvertently disturbed the crime scene, because she rummaged around, looking for any missing items. She became concerned because a neighbor discovered the two phones that Kercher normally carried with her in a nearby garden. Romanelli asked the police to force open Kercher's bedroom door, but they declined. Romanelli's male friend forced the door open around 1:15 pm. The body of Kercher was found inside, lying on the floor, covered by a duvet.\n\n\n=== Autopsy ===\nPathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's forensic-science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of 16 bruises and seven cuts, including a fatal cut to the neck. These included several bruises and a few insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's forensic-science institute, who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.\n\n\n=== Burial ===\nA funeral was held on 14 December 2007 at Croydon Minster, with more than 300 people in attendance, followed by a private burial at Mitcham Road Cemetery. The degree that Kercher would have received in 2009 was awarded posthumously by the University of Leeds.\n\n\n=== Meredith Kercher scholarship fund ===\nFive years after the murder, the city of Perugia and its University for Foreigners, in co-operation with the Italian embassy in London, instituted a scholarship fund to honour the memory of Meredith Kercher. John Kercher stated in an interview that all profits from his book Meredith would go to a charitable foundation in Meredith Kercher's name.\n\n\n=== Italian criminal procedure ===\n\nIn Italy, as in most countries, individuals accused of any crime are considered innocent until proven guilty, although the defendant may be held in detention. Unless the accused opts for a fast-track trial, murder cases are heard by a corte d'assise or court of assizes⁠⁠. This court has jurisdiction to try the most serious crimes, i.e., those crimes whose maximum penalty begins at 24 years in prison. A guilty verdict is not regarded as a definitive conviction until the accused has exhausted the appeals process, regardless of the number of times the defendant has been put on trial.\nItalian trials can last many months and have long gaps between hearings; the first trial of Knox and Sollecito was heard two days a week, for three weeks a month. If found guilty, a defendant is guaranteed what is in effect a retrial, where all evidence and witnesses can be re-examined.\nA verdict can be overturned by the Italian supreme court, the Corte di Cassazione (cassation is the annulment of a judicial decision), which considers written briefs. If the Corte di Cassazione overturns a verdict, it explains which legal principles were violated by the lower court, which in turn must abide by the ruling when retrying the case. If the Corte di Cassazione upholds a guilty verdict of the appeal trial, the conviction becomes definitive, the appeals process is exhausted, and any sentence is served.\n\n\n== Rudy Guede ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nRudy Hermann Guede (born 26 December 1986, Abidjan, Ivory Coast) was 20 years old at the time of the murder. He had lived in Perugia since the age of five with his immigrant, polygamous father. In Italy, Guede was mostly raised with the help of his school teachers, a local priest, and others. Guede's father returned to Ivory Coast in 2004. Rudy drifted and was fed, clothed, and housed by an informal group of well-meaning households, until the age of 17 when he was adopted by a wealthy Perugian family. He played basketball for the Perugia youth team in the 2004–2005 season.\nGuede repeatedly skipped school, and he did not show any interest in the jobs that his adoptive family arranged for him. His adoptive family asked him to leave their home, in mid-2007.\n\n\n=== Involvement in the case ===\nGuede said that he had met two of the Italian men of the Via della Pergola 7 house while spending evenings at the basketball court in the Piazza Grimana. The young men who lived in the downstairs flat at Via della Pergola 7 were unable to recall when exactly Guede had met them but recalled how, after his first visit to their home, they had found him later in the bathroom, sitting asleep on the unflushed toilet, which was full of feces. Allegedly, Guede committed break-ins, including one of a lawyer's office through a second-floor window, and another during which he burgled a flat and brandished a pocket knife when confronted by its inhabitants. On 27 October 2007, days before Kercher's murder, Guede was arrested in Milan after breaking into a nursery school; he was found by police with an 11 in (28 cm) knife, which he'd taken from the school kitchen.\nGuede went to a friend's house around 11:30 pm on 1 November 2007, the night of the murder. He went to a nightclub where he stayed until 4:30 am. On the following night, 2 November 2007, Guede went to the same nightclub with three American female students whom he had met in a bar. He then left Italy for Germany, where he was located in the subsequent weeks.\n\n\n=== Arrest ===\nAfter his fingerprints were found at the crime scene, along with DNA traces, Guede was extradited from Germany; he had said on the internet that he knew he was a suspect and wanted to clear his name.\n\n\n=== Trial ===\nGuede opted for a fast-track trial, held in closed session with no reporters present. He told the court that he had gone to Via della Pergola 7 on a date arranged with Kercher, after meeting her the previous evening. Two neighbours of Guede's, foreign female students who were with him at a nightclub on that evening, told police the only girl they saw him talking to had long, blonde hair. Guede said Kercher had let him in the cottage around 9 pm. Sollecito's lawyers said a glass fragment from the window found beside a shoeprint of Guede's at the scene of the crime was proof that Guede had broken in.\nGuede said that he and Kercher had kissed and touched, but they did not have sexual intercourse because they did not have condoms readily available. He claimed that he then developed stomach pains and crossed to the large bathroom on the other side of the apartment. Guede claimed he heard Kercher scream while he was in the bathroom, and that upon emerging, he saw a \"shadowy figure\" holding a knife and standing over her as she lay bleeding on the floor. Guede further said that the figure fled, while saying \"in perfect Italian,\" \"Trovato negro, trovato colpevole; andiamo\" (\"Found black man, found culprit; let's go\").\nThe court found that his version of events did not match the scientific evidence, and that he could not explain why one of his palm prints, stained with Kercher's blood, had been found on the pillow of the single bed, under the disrobed body. Guede said he had left Kercher fully dressed.\nGuede originally said that Knox had not been at the scene of the crime, but he later changed his statement to say that she had been in the apartment at the time of the murder. He claimed that he had heard her arguing with Kercher, and that, glancing out of a window, he had seen Knox's silhouette outside the house.\nIn October 2008, Guede was found guilty for the  sexual assault and murder of Meredith Kercher. He was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment. Judge Micheli acquitted Guede of the charge for theft.\n\n\n=== Appeal ===\nThree weeks after Knox and Sollecito were convicted, Guede had his prison term cut from 30 to 24 years. Then the automatic one-third reduction of a sentence decided in a fast-track trial kicked in, resulting in a final sentence of 16 years. A lawyer representing the Kercher family protested at the effective \"drastic reduction\" of the sentence.\n\n\n=== Imprisonment and release ===\nGuede was first granted day release from the Viterbo prison in 2017 to complete a master’s degree in sociology, and in December 2020 the authorities entrusted him to social services to carry out the rest of his sentence doing community service. He was working in the mornings at the Catholic charity Caritas and in the afternoons he was allowed to work in the library of the prison’s criminology centre.\nOn 12 November 2021, Guede was released from prison, having served a total of 13 years prison time compared to the original conviction of thirty years, which was reduced subsequently to sixteen after a court in Viterbo agreed to further reduce his sentence. Francesco Maresca, the lawyer representing the Kercher family, stated to La Stampa that, although it was \"normal\" for prison sentences to be reduced, a \"moral reflection\" should be exercised to assess if \"such a low [effective] sentence could be sufficient for a murder of this kind,\" adding that this would be another development he'd need to \"explain to the Kercher family.\"\nIn December 2023, a woman who had been Guede's girlfriend filed a complaint for physical abuse to the Rome police and a 500-metre restraining order was issued to Guede and he was placed under a set of various obligations. These include, among other measures, a total ban from having any contact whatsoever with the former girlfriend, including contacts through social media, the obligation to wear an electronic bracelet at all times, and to inform police before he leaves his city of residence, Viterbo.\nIn February 2024, a Roman court ruled that Guede would spend the next twelve months under a \"special surveillance\" regime for having allegedly abused his former girlfriend. On his Facebook page, Guede complained that he is the victim of a media hunt and claimed he is being punished for his past.\n\n\n== Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito ==\n\nIn outlining the case for colleagues hours after the discovery of the body, Perugia Reparto volanti (Mobile Squad) Detective Superintendent Monica Napoleoni told them that the murderer was definitely not a burglar and that apparent signs of a break-in were staged as a deliberate deception. Knox was the only occupant of the house who had been nearby on the night of the murder. Knox also said that she had spent the night of 1 November with Sollecito at his flat, smoking marijuana and watching the French film Amélie and having sex. Sollecito told police he could not remember if Knox was with him that evening or not. Over the next four days, Knox was repeatedly interviewed without being given access to a lawyer. On 6 November, Knox told investigators that Patrick Lumumba, the owner of the bar Knox was employed at part-time, had broken into the home she shared with Kercher and other roommates, before sexually assaulting and killing her. She later testified that she was subjected to pressure tactics and struck by police to make her incriminate herself. She was arrested and charged with murder at noon on 6 November 2007.\n\n\n=== Arrests ===\nNapoleoni was backed by several other detectives in arguing for the arrest of Knox, Sollecito, and Lumumba, the latter whom Knox had implicated as being involved. However, Napoleoni's immediate superior, Chief Superintendent Marco Chiacchiera, thought arrests would be premature and advocated close surveillance of the suspects as the best way to further the investigation. On 8 November 2007, Knox, Sollecito, and Lumumba appeared before Judge Claudia Matteini, and during an hour-long adjournment, Knox met her lawyers for the first time. Matteini ordered Knox, Sollecito, and Lumumba to be detained for a year. On 19 November 2007, the Rome forensic police matched fingerprints found in Kercher's bedroom to Rudy Guede. On 20 November 2007, Guede was arrested in Germany, and Lumumba was released. The prosecution charged Guede with the murder.\n\n\n=== Pretrial publicity ===\nKnox became the subject of intense media attention. Shortly before her trial, she began legal action against Fiorenza Sarzanini, the author of a best-selling book about her, which had been published in Italy. The book included accounts of events as imagined or invented by Sarzanini, witness transcripts not in the public record, and selected excerpts from Knox's private journals, which Sarzanini had somehow obtained. Lawyers for Knox said the book had \"reported in a prurient manner, aimed solely at arousing the morbid imagination of readers\".\nAccording to American legal commentator Kendal Coffey, \"In this country we would say, with this kind of media exposure, you could not get a fair trial\". In the United States, a pretrial publicity campaign supported Knox and attacked Italian investigators, but her lawyer thought it was counterproductive.\n\n\n=== Knox and Sollecito trials ===\nKnox and Sollecito were held in prison. Their trial began on 16 January 2009 before Judge Giancarlo Massei, Deputy Judge Beatrice Cristiani, and six lay judges at the Corte d'Assise of Perugia. The charges were that Knox, Sollecito, and Guede had murdered Kercher in her bedroom. Knox and Sollecito both pleaded not guilty.\nAccording to the prosecution, Knox had attacked Kercher in her bedroom, repeatedly banged her head against a wall, forcefully held her face, and tried to strangle her. Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini suggested Knox had taunted Kercher and may have said, \"You acted the goody-goody so much, now we are going to show you. Now you're going to be forced to have sex!\" The prosecution hypothesized that Guede, Knox, and Sollecito had removed Kercher's jeans, and held her on her hands and knees while Guede sexually abused her; that Knox had cut Kercher with a knife before inflicting the fatal stab wound; and that she had then stolen Kercher's mobile phones and money to fake a burglary. On 5 December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder and sentenced to 26 and 25 years' imprisonment, respectively.\nThe appeal (or second grade) trial began in November 2010, presided over by Judges Claudio Pratillo Hellmann and Massimo Zanetti. A court-ordered review of the contested DNA evidence by independent experts noted numerous basic errors in the gathering and analysis of the evidence, and concluded that no evidential trace of Kercher's DNA had been found on the alleged murder weapon. Although the review confirmed the DNA fragments on the bra clasp included some from Sollecito, an expert testified that the context strongly suggested contamination.\nOn 3 October 2011, Knox and Sollecito were acquitted. A ruling that proof was insufficient, similar to the verdict of not proven, was available to the court, but the court acquitted Knox and Sollecito completely. The conviction of Knox on a charge of slander of Patrick Lumumba was upheld, and the original one-year sentence was increased to three years and eleven days' imprisonment.\nIn their official report on the court's decision to overturn the convictions, the appeal trial judges wrote that the verdict of guilty at the original trial \"was not corroborated by any objective element of evidence\". Describing the police interviews of Knox as of \"obsessive duration\", the judges said that the statements she made incriminating herself and Lumumba during interrogation were evidence of her confusion while under \"great psychological pressure\". The judges further noted that a tramp who had testified to seeing Sollecito and Knox in the Piazza Grimana on the night of the murder was a heroin addict; that Massei, the judge at the 2009 trial, had used the word \"probably\" 39 times in his report; and that no evidence existed of any phone calls or texts between Knox or Sollecito, and Guede.\n\n\n==== New trial ====\nFollowing a successful prosecution request, a rehearing of Knox and Sollecito's second-level trial was held. The only new evidence came from the court-ordered analysis of a previously unexamined sample of the blade of Sollecito's kitchen knife, which the prosecution had alleged was the murder weapon. When the unexamined sample was tested by court-appointed experts for the new appeal trial, no DNA belonging to Kercher was found. Despite the negative result for the prosecution case, the court returned verdicts of guilty against the defendants, who both appealed.\n\n\n==== Acquittal of murder charge ====\nOn 27 March 2015, Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation, ruled that Knox and Sollecito were innocent of murder, thereby definitively ending the case. Rather than merely declaring that errors occurred in the earlier court cases or that evidence was insufficient to convict, the court ruled that Knox and Sollecito had not committed the murder and were innocent of those charges, but it upheld Knox's conviction for slandering Patrick Lumumba.\nAfter this verdict was announced, Knox, who had been in the United States continuously since 2011, said in a statement: \"The knowledge of my innocence has given me strength in the darkest times of this ordeal.\"\nIn September 2015, the delegate supreme judge, court adviser Gennaro Marasca, made public the reasons of absolution. First, none of the evidence demonstrated that either Knox or Sollecito was present at the crime scene. Second, they cannot have \"materially participated in the homicide\", since absolutely no \"biological traces ... could be attributed to them in the room of the murder or on the body of the victim, where in contrast numerous traces were found attributable to Guede\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBurleigh, Nina (2011).

        "title": "3I/ATLAS",
        "content": "3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and previously as A11pl3Z, is an interstellar comet discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) station at Río Hurtado, Chile on 1 July 2025. When it was discovered, it was entering the inner Solar System at a distance of 4.5 AU (670 million km; 420 million mi) from the Sun. The comet follows an unbound, hyperbolic trajectory past the Sun with a very fast hyperbolic excess velocity of 58 km/s (36 mi/s) relative to the Sun. 3I/ATLAS will not come closer than 1.8 AU (270 million km; 170 million mi) from Earth, so it poses no threat. It is the third interstellar object confirmed passing through the Solar System, after 1I/ʻOumuamua (discovered in October 2017) and 2I/Borisov (discovered in August 2019), hence the prefix \"3I\".\n3I/ATLAS is an active comet consisting of a solid icy nucleus and a coma, which is a cloud of gas and icy dust escaping from the nucleus. The size of 3I/ATLAS's nucleus is uncertain because its light cannot be separated from that of the coma. The Sun is responsible for the comet's activity because it heats up the comet's nucleus to sublimate its ice into gas, which outgasses and lifts up dust from the comet's surface to form its coma. Images by the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the diameter of 3I/ATLAS's nucleus is between 0.32 and 5.6 km (0.2 and 3.5 mi), with the most likely diameter being less than 1 km (0.62 mi). Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have shown that 3I/ATLAS is unusually rich in carbon dioxide and contains a small amount of water ice, water vapor, carbon monoxide, and carbonyl sulfide. Observations by the Very Large Telescope have also shown that 3I/ATLAS is emitting cyanide gas and atomic nickel vapor at concentrations similar to those seen in Solar System comets.\n3I/ATLAS will come closest to the Sun on 29 October 2025, at a distance of 1.36 AU (203 million km; 126 million mi) from the Sun, which is between the orbits of Earth and Mars. The comet appears to have originated from either the Milky Way's thin disk or thick disk; if 3I/ATLAS originated from the thick disk, the comet could be at least 7 billion years old—older than the Solar System.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Discovery ===\n\n3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope at Río Hurtado, Chile (observatory code W68). At apparent magnitude 18, the newly discovered object was entering the inner Solar System at a speed of 61 km/s (140,000 mph; 220,000 km/h) relative to the Sun, located 3.50 AU (524 million km; 325 million mi) from Earth and 4.51 AU from the Sun, and was moving in the sky along the border of the constellations Serpens Cauda and Sagittarius, near the galactic plane. It was given the temporary designation 'A11pl3Z' and the discovery observations were submitted to the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (MPC). These observations initially suggested that the object could be on a highly eccentric path that might come close to Earth's orbit, which led the MPC to temporarily list the object on the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page until the orbit could be confirmed.\nFollow-up observations from other observatories, involving both professional and amateur astronomers, began to reveal that the object's trajectory would not come near Earth, but instead could be interstellar with a hyperbolic trajectory. Pre-discovery observations of 3I/ATLAS confirmed its interstellar trajectory; these included Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, observatory code I41) observations from 28 to 29 June 2025 that were found within a few hours of the initial report, ZTF observations from 14 to 21 June 2025, and ATLAS observations from 25 to 29 June 2025. Amateur astronomer Sam Deen has noted additional ATLAS pre-discovery observations from 5 to 25 June 2025, and suspected that 3I/ATLAS was not discovered earlier because it was passing in front of the Galactic Center's dense star fields, where the comet would be hard to discern.\nInitial observations of 3I/ATLAS were unclear on whether it is an asteroid or a comet. Various astronomers including Alan Hale reported no cometary features, but observations on 2 July 2025 by the Deep Random Survey (X09) at Chile, Lowell Discovery Telescope (G37) at Arizona, and Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope (T14) at Mauna Kea all showed a marginal coma with a potential tail-like elongation 3 arcseconds in angular length, which indicated the object is a comet. On 2 July 2025, the MPC announced the discovery of 3I/ATLAS and gave it the interstellar object designation \"3I\", signifying it being the third interstellar object confirmed. The MPC also gave 3I/ATLAS the non-periodic comet designation C/2025 N1 (ATLAS). By the time 3I/ATLAS was officially named, the MPC had collected 122 observations of the comet from 31 different observatories.\n\n\n=== Further observations ===\n\nObservations by David Jewitt and Jane Luu using the Nordic Optical Telescope on 2 July 2025 confirmed that 3I/ATLAS was \"clearly active\" with a diffuse appearance. Miguel R. Alarcón and a team of researchers of the IAC (Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias) using Teide Observatory's Two-meter Twin Telescope also found cometary activity on the same date. Multiple different telescopes showed that the comet's coma had a reddish color indicative of dust, similar to that of the previous interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. A study published by Toni Santana-Ros and colleagues in August 2025 reported that 3I/ATLAS's coma had become redder throughout July 2025, indicating an evolving surface or coma composition as a result of 3I/ATLAS's increasing cometary activity.\nOn 6 July, additional observations were published, including Zwicky Transient Facility (I41) precoveries from several nights between 22 May and 21 June 2025. An even earlier precovery from 21 May 2025, made at Weizmann Astrophysical Observatory (M01), was published on 18 July 2025.\nThe newly commissioned Vera C. Rubin Observatory has serendipitously imaged 3I/ATLAS during its science validation observations from 21 June to 3 July 2025. These observations showed a slight increase in the comet's coma diameter and provided constraints on the comet's nucleus diameter. The Vera Rubin Observatory would have discovered 3I/ATLAS before the ATLAS survey if it had begun its science validation observations two weeks earlier. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) had also observed 3I/ATLAS before it was discovered, with observations from 7 May to 3 June 2025. These observations showed that the comet was already bright and active even when it was roughly 6.4 AU away from the Sun in May 2025, which indicates the comet's activity is likely caused by the sublimation of volatile ices other than water.\nWater ice in 3I/ATLAS's coma was first reported on 20 July 2025, based on near-infrared spectroscopic observations by the Gemini South and NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on 5 and 14 July 2025. Ultraviolet observations by the Swift Observatory suggested the presence of water vapor and hydroxide ions in 3I/ATLAS's coma on 30 July 2025 and 1 August 2025. On 21 August 2025, astronomers of NASA's SPHEREx mission and the California Institute of Technology reported the detection of water ice and bright carbon dioxide gas emission in SPHEREx observations from mid-August 2025. On 22 August 2025, astronomers at Lowell Observatory reported the first tentative detection of cyanide emission in 3I/ATLAS. Spectroscopic observations by the Very Large Telescope on 21 August 2025 confirmed the presence of cyanide and also detected nickel in 3I/ATLAS's coma.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope took its first images of 3I/ATLAS on 21 July 2025, which revealed its coma in high detail and constrained its nucleus diameter to below 5.6 km (3.5 mi). The Hubble images were publicized by NASA and the European Space Agency on 7 August 2025. On 6 August 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) made its first observations of 3I/ATLAS using its NIRSpec instrument, and results were announced by NASA on 25 August 2025. In November 2025, Hubble will perform ultraviolet spectroscopy on 3I/ATLAS to determine the composition of its gas emissions and sulfur-to-oxygen ratio, and the telescope will monitor the comet on its way out of the Solar System. The JWST is scheduled to make its next observations of 3I/ATLAS in December 2025, after the comet's perihelion.\n\n\n== Trajectory ==\n\n3I/ATLAS follows an extremely hyperbolic trajectory past the Sun because it is moving too fast to be bound by the Sun's gravity. When 3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System, it was moving at a speed of 58 km/s (36 mi/s; 1.02 AU/month) relative to the Sun—this speed is the comet's hyperbolic excess velocity (v∞). As 3I/ATLAS comes closer to the Sun and gets pulled in by the Sun's gravity, the comet will speed up, and then once it begins moving away, the comet will slow down as the Sun's gravity begins pulling back on it. Nevertheless, the comet will escape the Solar System. 3I/ATLAS is moving far faster than the previous two interstellar objects 1I/ʻOumuamua (v∞=26 km/s) and 2I/Borisov (v∞=32 km/s).\nThe shape of 3I/ATLAS's trajectory is described by a parameter known as the orbital eccentricity. Whereas elliptical orbits have an eccentricity less than 1, hyperbolic orbits have an eccentricity greater than 1. For 3I/ATLAS, its trajectory has an extremely high orbital eccentricity of 6.141±0.002. This extremely high eccentricity makes the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS appear relatively straight, rather than curved. 3I/ATLAS has the highest eccentricity of the three interstellar objects known to date, greater than 1I/ʻOumuamua's (e=1.2) and 2I/Borisov's (e=3.4).\n3I/ATLAS will come closest to the Sun on 29 October 2025 at 11:44 ± 00:02 UT. The comet's perihelion or closest distance to the Sun is 1.36 AU (203 million km; 126 million mi), which lies between the orbits of Earth and Mars. At perihelion, the comet will be moving at its maximum speed of 68 km/s (42 mi/s) with respect to the Sun.\nThe trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is coincidentally closely aligned with the orbital planes of the Solar System's planets, or the ecliptic. Specifically, the comet's trajectory is tilted 175° (retrograde and inclined 5°) with respect to the ecliptic. The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS will bring the comet close to the planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, but not Earth. Since 3I/ATLAS cannot come close to Earth, it poses no threat to Earth. As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, it will pass by Mars at a distance of 0.19 AU (28 million km; 18 million mi) on 3 October 2025. After perihelion, it will pass 0.65 AU (97 million km; 60 million mi) from Venus on 3 November 2025, 1.80 AU (269 million km; 167 million mi) from Earth on 19 December 2025, and then it will pass 0.36 AU (54 million km; 33 million mi) from Jupiter on 16 March 2026.\n\n\n== Observability ==\n3I/ATLAS is a faint comet that is not expected to get brighter than about apparent magnitude 11.5 from Earth. Even at its peak brightness, the comet will not be visible to an observer on Earth using the naked eye or to an average observer with a pair of 50 mm binoculars. 3I/ATLAS has been imaged by plate-solving smart telescopes with an aperture diameter of at least 3 to 4.5 in (7.6 to 11.4 cm). As of September 2025, 3I/ATLAS has a total magnitude (nucleus+coma) of 15.5 which makes it currently about 100 times fainter than comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon).\nFrom July to September 2025, 3I/ATLAS is observable from Earth after sunset. During the first half of July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was located in the constellation Sagittarius at an apparent magnitude of 17.5. By the second half of July 2025, 3I/ATLAS had moved to the constellation Ophiuchus and had brightened to apparent magnitude 16. During that time, the comet was located in a region of the sky where it was densely filled with stars, which made observations challenging as the comet could overlap background stars. The comet will continue brightening as it approaches the Sun, and throughout August 2025 it will move across the constellations Ophiuchus, Scorpius, and Libra. During September 2025, 3I/ATLAS will remain in the constellation Libra as it brightens from apparent magnitude 14 to 11.7.\nAs the comet approaches perihelion by October 2025, the comet's solar elongation or angular separation from the Sun in the sky will decrease, which will narrow down its visibility to only equatorial regions of Earth just after sunset. The comet will be less than 30 degrees from the Sun from 1 October 2025 to 9 November 2025. The reason for 3I/ATLAS's decreasing solar elongation before perihelion is because the comet will come to perihelion on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth—in other words, it will enter solar conjunction. This means 3I/ATLAS will appear behind the Sun from Earth during the comet's perihelion, so the comet will not be observable from Earth during this time. On the other hand, the comet will pass close to Mars during that month and may reach an apparent magnitude of 11 from the planet, which means Mars orbiters may be able to observe the comet near perihelion.\nAfter 3I/ATLAS passes perihelion, it will be visible in the sky again just before sunrise in November 2025. The comet will grow dimmer and its solar elongation will increase as it moves away from the Sun. During December 2025, the comet will move through the constellations Virgo and Leo and its brightness is expected to become dimmer than apparent magnitude 12.\n\n\n== Origin and age ==\n\n3I/ATLAS is recognized as an interstellar object because of its extremely hyperbolic path and very high speed relative to the Solar System. 3I/ATLAS did not pass close enough to any of the Solar System's planets to have gained its speed, so it could not have originated from the Solar System. Tracing the path of 3I/ATLAS in the sky shows that the comet originated from interstellar space in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, near the Milky Way's Galactic Center.\nUnlike the previous two interstellar objects, 3I/ATLAS originated from the southern celestial hemisphere in a direction opposite to the solar apex in the north, which is the direction of the Sun's movement relative to local stars. The southern origin of 3I/ATLAS was unexpected because astronomers initially predicted that more interstellar objects should come from the solar apex, and that telescopes should have a more difficult time discovering southern-origin interstellar objects. It is possible that either 3I/ATLAS is a rare discovery, or southern-origin interstellar objects may be more common than initially thought.\nThe origin of 3I/ATLAS can be deduced by breaking down its hyperbolic excess velocity into radial (U), transverse (V), and vertical (W) velocity components in the galactic coordinate system. When 3I/ATLAS arrived to the Solar System, it was moving away from the Galactic Center with a velocity of U=−51.0 km/s with respect to the Sun and was moving upward through the galactic plane with a velocity of W=+18.5 km/s with respect to the Sun. The vertical W velocity of 3I/ATLAS is quite high compared to those of nearby stars and other interstellar objects, which means that the comet follows a tilted orbit around the Milky Way and thus belongs to either the thin disk or thick disk populations. The thick disk mainly consists of older stars whose compositions have lower levels of heavy elements than the Sun.\nA July 2025 study led by Matthew Hopkins and collaborators estimated with 68% confidence that 3I/ATLAS is between 7.6 and 14 billion years old, based on the typical ages of stars in the thick disk. This means that 3I/ATLAS could be older than the Solar System (which is 4.6 billion years old) and may well be the oldest comet seen as of yet. An independent analysis by Aster Taylor and Darryl Seligman in July 2025 estimated that 3I/ATLAS should be 3 to 11 billion years old, in broad agreement with Hopkins et al.'s estimate.\n\n\n=== Parent star and formation ===\n3I/ATLAS cannot be traced back to its original parent star because the comet has been traveling around the Milky Way for billions of years, which is enough time for it to be mixed around with other stars. It is likely that 3I/ATLAS's speed has undergone changes during its journey through interstellar space, via gravity assists from close encounters with stars and nebulae. A September 2025 study by Yiyang Guo and collaborators found that 3I/ATLAS may have passed within 1 parsec (3.3 light-years) of 25 known stars in the past 10 million years.\nAlthough the parent star of 3I/ATLAS is unknown, the properties and environment of its parent star can be inferred from the comet's composition and dynamical membership in the Galactic disk. If it is a member of the thick disk, the parent star of 3I/ATLAS could be a low-metallicity star with a heavy element abundance of at least 40% of the Sun's. 3I/ATLAS is presumed to have formed within a protoplanetary disk of gas and dust, which surrounded the parent star when it was young. Observations by JWST and SPHEREx have shown that 3I/ATLAS is rich in carbon dioxide (CO2), which suggests that it formed far from its parent star, beyond the CO2 frost line where temperatures are cold enough for CO2 to condense into solid. At some point after its formation, 3I/ATLAS was gravitationally flung out of its parent star system, either by a close encounter with a giant planet or a star.\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Cometary activity ===\n\n\n==== Coma ====\n\n3I/ATLAS appears distinctly fuzzier than stars in telescope images, which means that the solid body or nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is surrounded by a coma, a cloud of gas and icy dust ejected from the comet's outgassing surface. The Sun is responsible for the comet's activity because it heats up the comet's nucleus to sublimate its volatile ices into gas, which ejects dust from the comet's surface and escapes into space. Dust particles in the coma of 3I/ATLAS eventually trail away from the nucleus (with smaller particles blown away by solar radiation pressure), leading to the formation of a dust tail behind the comet.\nAs 3I/ATLAS comes closer to the Sun, it will become more active as its volatile ices will heat up more and begin sublimating faster; this could potentially lead to outbursts, where the comet suddenly ejects a large amount of dust and brightens, or even fragmentation events, where the comet's nucleus breaks into pieces like what happened with the previous interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. As of August 2025, observations have not detected any outbursts in 3I/ATLAS; its brightness and activity level appear to be steady. Observations by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) show that 3I/ATLAS may have been exhibiting cometary activity as early as 7 May 2025 (two months before its discovery), when it was roughly 6.4 AU away from the Sun.\nThe coma of 3I/ATLAS appears slightly elliptical and spans up to 26,400 by 24,700 km (16,400 by 15,300 mi) in diameter (about twice the diameter of Earth), according to high-resolution images from the 10.4-meter (34 ft) Gran Telescopio Canarias on 2 July 2025. Observations by NASA's SPHEREx mission from mid-August 2025 showed that 3I/ATLAS has a more extensive carbon dioxide gas coma that spans at least 348,000 km (216,000 mi) in radius, although it is only visible in near-infrared. Because the comet is far away from Earth, its coma appears small in the sky; observations from July 2025 have measured an angular diameter of about 2 arcseconds for the most visible part of the coma (the coma's full width at half maximum) and 10 arcseconds for the full extent of the coma. As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun and becomes more active, the size and density of its coma will continue to grow. Pre-discovery observations by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory showed that the diameter of 3I/ATLAS's coma had grown from 13,040 km (8,100 mi) on 21 June 2025 to 18,760 km (11,660 mi) on 2 July 2025.\nSpectroscopic and imaging observations indicate that the coma of 3I/ATLAS has a reddish color and is mainly made of relatively large dust grains that are several micrometers (μm) in radius. The reddish color of 3I/ATLAS is similar to the colors of D-type asteroids, Solar System comets, and the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, and is likely caused by irradiated organic compounds in the comet's coma. Within the coma of 3I/ATLAS, small dust grains with 1 μm radii are ejected from the nucleus at fast speeds of 22 m/s, whereas large dust grains with 100 μm radii are ejected at slower speeds of about 2 m/s. Based on the shape and brightness of 3I/ATLAS's coma in Hubble Space Telescope images from July 2025, it is estimated that the comet was ejecting 6 kg (13 lb) of small dust particles per second and 60 kg (130 lb) of large dust particles per second during that month. The dust ejection rate of 3I/ATLAS is similar to that of 2I/Borisov when it was approaching the Solar System, but it is lower than the typical rates for distant Jupiter-family comets.\n\n\n==== Sun-facing plume ====\n\nDuring July and August 2025, the coma of 3I/ATLAS appeared to be elongated westward in the sky—in a direction toward the Sun and toward the comet's direction of motion rather than away. This Sun-facing feature is not a tail (contrary to initial reports), but is rather a dust plume that is being emitted from the heated, sunlit surface of 3I/ATLAS's nucleus, where ice sublimation occurs faster and thus ejects more dust. The Sun-facing elongation of 3I/ATLAS's coma resembles those of other distant comets like C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli–Bernstein), which have been known to preferentially eject dust from the sunlit side of their surfaces.\n\n\n==== Tail ====\nHubble images from July 2025 showed that 3I/ATLAS had a very faint and broad tail pointing eastward, in a direction away from the Sun. A tail pointing away from the Sun is a common cometary feature that is formed when small dust particles are blown away by solar radiation pressure. The broad appearance of this tail suggests that small dust particles were ejected from 3I/ATLAS's surface at high speeds. The anti-solar tail of 3I/ATLAS was thought to be pointed directly away from Earth in July 2025, which would have made it foreshortened and mostly hidden behind 3I/ATLAS's coma. By the end of August 2025, observations by the 8.2-meter Gemini South telescope showed that the anti-solar tail of 3I/ATLAS had grown to 30 arcseconds in angular length or roughly 56,000 km (35,000 mi). The tail of 3I/ATLAS is expected to become more obvious as the comet approaches perihelion with changing viewing geometry and increasing cometary activity.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nHigh-resolution images by the Hubble Space Telescope from July 2025 indicate that the diameter of 3I/ATLAS's nucleus is between 0.32 and 5.6 km (0.2 and 3.5 mi). There is a large uncertainty in the estimated diameter of 3I/ATLAS's nucleus because it is surrounded by a coma of reflective dust, which makes the nucleus appear brighter and larger than it actually is. For example, early studies from July 2025 gave diameter estimates that were as high as 10 to 20 km (6.2 to 12.4 mi), although astronomers were well aware that the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS should be much smaller. While the exact brightness of the coma is unknown, Hubble images show that the coma's brightness must account for a large fraction of the nucleus's apparent brightness, so the actual diameter of 3I/ATLAS's nucleus should be at the lower end of the estimated range. The estimated dust loss rate of 3I/ATLAS suggests that its nucleus is likely less than a kilometer in diameter, like 2I/Borisov. Although observations by the Swift Observatory suggested that 3I/ATLAS could have a larger diameter of 4.94 km (3.07 mi) based on the comet's water vapor emission area, this diameter is likely an overestimate because most of 3I/ATLAS's water vapor is believed to come from its coma rather than its nucleus.\n\n\n=== Composition and gas emissions ===\nNear-infrared spectroscopy by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in August 2025 has shown that the coma of 3I/ATLAS is unusually rich in carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, with small amounts of water ice, water vapor, carbon monoxide (CO) gas, and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) gas. The JWST has also revealed the presence of \"heavy\" CO2 containing the isotope carbon-13 (13C) in 3I/ATLAS's coma, although partial obscuration by dust and other gases makes it difficult to quantify the abundance of 13C relative to the more common isotope 12C. Spectroscopic observations by the SPHEREx space observatory agree that 3I/ATLAS contains high amounts of CO2 in its coma, although SPHEREx did not have the sensitivity to detect water vapor and CO.\nFrom the August 2025 JWST observations, it is estimated that 3I/ATLAS's nucleus was emitting 129 ± 1 kg (284.4 ± 2.2 lb) of CO2 per second, 6.6 ± 0.2 kg (14.6 ± 0.4 lb) of water per second, 14.0 ± 0.9 kg (30.9 ± 2.0 lb) of CO per second, and 0.43 ± 0.09 kg (0.95 ± 0.20 lb) of OCS per second. Analysis of absorption features in JWST's spectrum of 3I/ATLAS suggests that the water ice in the comet's coma consists of fine grains smaller than 1 micrometer in size. The water ice in 3I/ATLAS is likely amorphous, although crystalline water ice cannot be ruled out. A tentative detection of water vapor and hydroxyl radicals (OH) by the Swift Observatory on 31 July and 1 August 2025 suggested that the water ice grains in 3I/ATLAS's coma are sublimating beyond the nucleus, likely at a distance between 4,000 and 10,000 km (2,500 and 6,200 mi) from the nucleus. The water ice grains were most likely ejected from the comet's nucleus by outgassing of volatile substances such as CO2 and CO, rather than water ice sublimation.\nUltraviolet spectroscopy by telescopes on Earth have additionally detected cyanide (CN) gas and atomic nickel (Ni I) vapor in the coma of 3I/ATLAS. The emission of atomic nickel is not unusual; it has been seen in various comets, including the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. However, no iron (Fe I) vapor was detected in 3I/ATLAS, which is unusual because nickel and iron are typically found in roughly equal amounts when outgassing from comets. Nickel emission in 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on 20 July 2025, and cyanide emission was first detected by the VLT later on 14 August 2025. Throughout July to August 2025, the VLT observed a \"rapid and steady\" increase in the concentration of nickel and cyanide in 3I/ATLAS's coma, due to the comet's increasing activity during its approach to the Sun (from 4.4 to 2.85 AU). It is estimated that 3I/ATLAS was emitting 4.6 ± 0.7 g (0.16 ± 0.02 oz) of nickel per second and 17.6 ± 2.0 g (0.62 ± 0.07 oz) of cyanide per second by the time the VLT observations ended on 21 August 2025. Although it is unusual that nickel emission was detected before cyanide, the concentrations of nickel and cyanide in 3I/ATLAS are generally similar to those seen in other Solar System comets observed at similar distances from the Sun. It is uncertain how nickel vapor is released from 3I/ATLAS; Rohan Rahatgaonkar and colleagues who analyzed the VLT observations proposed that there are several possible processes involving the chemical decomposition of nickel-containing organic compounds (e.g. nickel tetracarbonyl) via space weathering. The amount of nickel observed in 3I/ATLAS is still consistent with earlier predictions that it should have a metal-poor composition.\nDuring July to August 2025, the VLT did not detect any signs of atomic oxygen [O I], dicarbon (C2), tricarbon (C3), and amino radicals (NH2) in the coma of 3I/ATLAS. Likewise, observations by the MDM Observatory did not detect C2 and C3 in the coma of 3I/ATLAS during August 2025, which suggests that the comet is highly depleted in carbon chain compounds. The upper limit to the comet's C2-to-CN ratio suggests that 3I/ATLAS is one of the most carbon chain-depleted comets ever known.\n\n\n==== Carbon dioxide abundance ====\n\nWithin the coma of 3I/ATLAS, the mixing ratio of CO2 relative to water is 8.0±1.0—this is one of the highest CO2 abundances seen in a comet, especially at its distance from the Sun (3.32 AU) when it was first observed by JWST. Whereas Solar System comets generally follow a trend of increasing CO2-to-water mixing ratio with distance from the Sun (due to CO2 sublimating more than water at closer distances to the Sun), only 3I/ATLAS and the unusual Oort cloud comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS) are known to break this trend with exceptionally high CO2-to-water mixing ratios. On the other hand, the coma of 3I/ATLAS has a more typical CO-to-water mixing ratio of 1.4±0.2, resembling other Solar System comets including the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov.\nThe reason for the high abundance of CO2 in 3I/ATLAS's coma is uncertain; this could either mean that the comet has a CO2-rich nucleus or there is some mechanism limiting the sublimation of water from its nucleus. A team of NASA researchers led by Martin A. Cordiner have hypothesized that if 3I/ATLAS has a CO2-rich nucleus, the comet may have either been exposed to high amounts of radiation or may have formed close to the CO2 frost line in its parent star's protoplanetary disk. Alternatively, if 3I/ATLAS contains more water than suggested by JWST, 3I/ATLAS could have an unusually thick, insulating crust hiding water ice underneath. Further observations by the JWST, especially when 3I/ATLAS becomes more active, will be needed to determine which scenario is more likely.\n\n\n=== Rotation ===\nThe nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is expected to be irregularly shaped like other comets, which should cause periodic variations in 3I/ATLAS's brightness as it rotates. However, because the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is partially obscured by a dusty coma, the nucleus's brightness variations are reduced, which makes it difficult to measure its rotation period using telescopic observations. Some early studies from July 2025 were unable to determine a rotation period for 3I/ATLAS's nucleus, but one study led by Raul de la Fuente Marcos and colleagues reported a rotation period of 16.79±0.23 hours, using observations by the Gran Telescopio Canarias from 2 to 5 July. Another study published by Toni Santana-Ros and colleagues in August 2025 reported a similar (albeit shorter) rotation period of 16.16±0.01 hours, using observations by multiple different telescopes from 2 to 29 July. Santana-Ros and colleagues noted that the brightness variations of 3I/ATLAS had decreased from 0.3 to 0.2 magnitudes throughout July 2025, which likely indicates that 3I/ATLAS's nucleus became more obscured as it became more active. In August 2025, Viriginio Oldani and other Italian astronomers performed an analysis of 3I/ATLAS's coma shape in Hubble Space Telescope images and suggested that the rotational north pole of 3I/ATLAS's nucleus may be pointed toward the directions of either RA 154°, Dec +25° or RA 334°, Dec –25°.\n\n\n== Exploration ==\nLaunching a space probe from Earth to perform a fly by of 3I/ATLAS is not feasible, as any post-discovery launch (after 1 July 2025) would require an extremely high delta-v (Δv) at least 24 km/s, which is beyond the capability of any propulsion system available at the time. If 3I/ATLAS had been discovered before 1 July 2025, a space probe launched from Earth on that date would have required Δv~7 km/s to visit the comet. A July 2025 study led by Atsuhiro Yaginuma and collaborators found that it would be more feasible to visit 3I/ATLAS using a space probe launched from Mars, which requires substantially less Δv. For example, putative space probes launched from Mars between July and September 2025 would require Δv~5 km/s to fly by 3I/ATLAS in early October 2025.\nSpacecraft orbiting Mars may be able to observe 3I/ATLAS during its close encounter with Mars in October 2025. The Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter may be able to observe 3I/ATLAS when it passes close to Jupiter in March 2026, but it is unlikely that Juno could be redirected to 3I/ATLAS because the spacecraft is low on fuel and has issues with its engine. Astrophysicist Marshall Eubanks has calculated that the Psyche spacecraft will pass about 0.302 AU (45.2 million km; 28.1 million mi) from 3I/ATLAS on 4 September 2025, while the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will pass within 0.428 AU (64.0 million km; 39.8 million mi) from 3I/ATLAS on 4 November 2025. However, commanding these spacecraft to observe 3I/ATLAS will be difficult and could introduce risks to their primary missions.\n\n\n== Alien spacecraft speculation ==\nOn 16 July 2025, astrophysicist Avi Loeb and other researchers of the Initiative for Interstellar Studies published a paper on arXiv speculating that 3I/ATLAS could be an extraterrestrial spacecraft because they believed the object had \"anomalous\" characteristics, such as having an apparently large size, lack of identifiable chemicals, and an apparently improbable trajectory aligned with the Solar System's ecliptic plane. Other astronomers, including Chris Lintott, immediately criticized Loeb's speculation; the science news website Live Science reported that \"the overwhelming consensus is that it is a comet,\" with many researchers \"disappointed with the new paper and pointed out that it distracts from the work of other scientists.\" Several astrophysicists, including Scott Manley and David Kipping, have pointed out flaws in Loeb's statistical analysis of 3I/ATLAS's trajectory. Darryl Seligman, who led the first published study on 3I/ATLAS, stated that \"there have been numerous telescopic observations of 3I/ATLAS demonstrating that it's displaying classical signatures of cometary activity.\" Seligman further elaborated that chemicals in 3I/ATLAS may not be detectable yet since the object was still far away from the Sun. JWST has since confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is outgassing CO2, water, and CO.\nOn 31 July to 1 August, the Swift Observatory found tentative evidence for water vapor and OH. Cyanide gas (CN) and atomic nickel vapor were detected by the VLT on 14 August 2025 and 20 July 2025 respectively. These substances are commonly found in comets.\nLoeb has previously suggested that 1I/ʻOumuamua and other interstellar objects including the reputedly interstellar meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08 could be extraterrestrial spacecraft, for which he was also criticized by many researchers. While Loeb has written in his blog that \"the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet,\" he defended his hypothesis as an \"interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to explore, irrespective of its likely validity.\" Astronomer Samantha Lawler highlighted that \"while it is important to remain open-minded about any 'testable prediction', the new paper [by Loeb et al.] pushes this sentiment to the limit.\" Lawler further said that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, while \"the evidence presented [by Loeb et al.] is absolutely not extraordinary.\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== 1 July 2025 ===\n\n\n=== 2 July 2025 ===\n\n\n=== 3 July 2025 ===\n\n\n=== 4 July 2025 ===\n\n\n=== 21 July 2025 ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nInterstellar Visitor is Fastest Comet Ever Recorded, NASA Goddard, YouTube, 7 August 2025\nHubble makes size estimate of interstellar comet, European Space Agency, 7 August 2025\nComet 3I/ATLAS Frequently Asked Questions, NASA\n3I/ATLAS Observations Coordination website\n3I/ATLAS Star Chart and Magnitude Graph, by Seiichi Yoshida, updated 25 July 2025\nStar Chart, by Gianluca Masi, Virtual Telescope Project\nInteractive orbit animation, by David Rankin, Catalina Sky Survey\n3I/ATLAS at the JPL Small-Body Database",

        "title": "Tom Cruise",
        "content": "Thomas Cruise Mapother IV (born July 3, 1962) is an American actor and film producer. Regarded as a Hollywood icon, he has received various accolades, including an Honorary Palme d'Or and three Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for four Academy Awards. As of 2025, his films have grossed over $13.3 billion worldwide, placing him among the highest-grossing actors of all time. One of Hollywood's most bankable stars, he is consistently one of the world's highest-paid actors.\nCruise began acting in the early 1980s and made his breakthrough with leading roles in Risky Business (1983) and Top Gun (1986), the latter earning him a reputation as a sex symbol. Critical acclaim came with his roles in the dramas The Color of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988), and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). For his portrayal of Ron Kovic in the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. As a leading Hollywood star in the 1990s, he starred in commercially successful films, including the drama A Few Good Men (1992), the thriller The Firm (1993), the horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994), and the sports comedy-drama Jerry Maguire (1996); for the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and his second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Cruise's performance in the drama Magnolia (1999) earned him another Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nCruise subsequently established himself as a star of science fiction and action films, often performing his own risky stunts. He played fictional agent Ethan Hunt in eight Mission: Impossible films, beginning with Mission: Impossible (1996) and ending with Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (2025). His other films in the genre include Vanilla Sky (2001), Minority Report (2002), The Last Samurai (2003), Collateral (2004), War of the Worlds (2005), Knight and Day (2010), Jack Reacher (2012), Oblivion (2013), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and Top Gun: Maverick (2022).\nCruise holds the Guinness World Record for the most consecutive $100-million-grossing movies, a feat that was achieved during the period of 2012 to 2018. In December 2024, he was awarded the US Navy's highest civilian honor, the Distinguished Public Service Award, in recognition of his \"outstanding contributions\" to the military, with his screen roles. Forbes ranked him as the world's most powerful celebrity in 2006. He was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1990, and received the top honor of \"Most Beautiful People\" in 1997. Outside his film career, Cruise has been an outspoken advocate for Church of Scientology, which has resulted in controversy and scrutiny of his involvement in the organization. An aviation enthusiast, he has held a pilot certificate since 1994.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCruise was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017). His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five films.\nCruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as \"a merchant of chaos\", a \"bully\", and a \"coward\" who beat his children. He elaborated, \"[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'\" Cruise's biological father died of cancer in 1984.\nIn total, Cruise attended fifteen schools in fourteen years. Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada; when his father took a job as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces, his family moved in late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa. He attended the new Robert Hopkins Public School for his fourth and fifth grade education. He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under drama teacher George Steinburg. He and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival. Drama organizer Val Wright was in the audience and later said that \"the movement and improvisation were excellent ... a classic ensemble piece.\"\nIn sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States. In 1978 she married Jack South. Cruise briefly took a Catholic church scholarship and attended the St. Francis Seminary in Cincinnati. He aspired to become a priest in the Franciscan order but left after a year. Priests at the seminary have said Cruise chose to leave the school when his family relocated again; however, a former classmate said that they were both asked to leave after getting caught taking liquor. In his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game. He went on to star in the school's production of Guys and Dolls. In 1980, he graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.\n\n\n== Acting career ==\n\n\n=== 1980s: Breakthrough and stardom ===\n\nAt age 18, with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, Cruise moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. After working as a busboy in New York, he went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. He signed with CAA and began acting in films. He made his film debut in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year. Cruise was originally supposed to appear as a background actor but his role was expanded after impressing director Harold Becker. He next won the role of Steve Randle in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 cinematic adaptation of S. E. Hinton's novel, The Outsiders, and shared the screen with an ensemble cast that included Matt Dillon, Emilio Estevez,  Leif Garrett, C. Thomas Howell, Diane Lane,  Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, and Patrick Swayze. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as \"A Generation X classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise.\" He also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985. By 1986's Top Gun, his status as a superstar had been cemented.\nCruise followed up Top Gun with Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money (1986), which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. Their chemistry won praise among critics with The Washington Post writing, \"One of the subtle achievements of both Cruise's and Newman's performances is that you feel that both of them are genuinely top-notch pool hustlers\". In 1988, Cruise starred in Cocktail, a film that was a box office success but failed with critics. His performance earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Barry Levinson's Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nIn 1989, Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone's war epic Born on the Fourth of July. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"Nothing Cruise has done will prepare you for what he does in Born on the Fourth of July ... His performance is so good that the movie lives through it. Stone is able to make his statement with Cruise's face and voice and doesn't need to put everything into the dialogue.\" The performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise's first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.\n\n\n=== 1990s: Dramatic roles ===\nCruise's next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest, followed by the legal thriller The Firm, which was a critical and commercial success. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice's best-selling novel. The film was well-received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film, however, she paid $7,740 (equivalent to $16,420 in 2024) for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.\nIn 1996, Cruise starred as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he also produced. The film was directed by Brian De Palma and was a box office success. Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised Cruise's performance, declaring \"Tom Cruise has found the perfect superhero character on which to graft his breathlessly gung-ho screen personality.\" In the same year, Cruise took on the title role in Cameron Crowe's sports drama Jerry Maguire playing a sports agent in search of love. The film was a massive financial success grossing more than $273 million worldwide against its $50 million budget.\nIn 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in Stanley Kubrick's erotic and psychological drama film Eyes Wide Shut. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised both Cruise and Kidman on their performances writing, \"Cruise in particular lays himself open in that fiercely committed way that he tries everything as an actor\". That same year he took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999). Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers heaped praise on Cruise writing, \"Cruise is a revelation, fully deserving of the shower of superlatives coming his way ... Cruise seethes with the chaotic energy of a wounded animal—he's devastating.\" For his performance he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.\n\n\n=== 2000s: Established career ===\n\nIn 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission: Impossible films, Mission: Impossible 2. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style; it continued the series' success at the box office, taking in $547 million worldwide. Unlike its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, but had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for the film. His next five films were major critical and commercial successes. The following year, Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction action film Minority Report, which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the short story by Philip K. Dick. It has since been included in lists of the greatest science fiction films of all time.\nIn 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick's period action drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in Collateral. The critical consensus states that \"Driven by director Michael Mann's trademark visuals and a lean, villainous performance from Tom Cruise, Collateral is a stylish and compelling noir thriller.\" In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with $591.4 million worldwide. Also in 2005, he was a nominee for the People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star and the winner of the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100 million at the box office.\nIn 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series and grossed nearly $400 million at the box office. In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as \"Les Grossman\" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008, to box office success.\n\n\n=== 2010s: Action star ===\nIn March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010. On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011 to high critical acclaim and box office success. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise's biggest commercial success to that date.\n\nOn May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and its Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist. In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages (2012), in which he played the fictional character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012 and was a rare box-office misstep for Cruise. Cruise however received positive reviews for his performance with Variety's film critic Justin Chang writing, \"Channeling the likes of Axl Rose and Keith Richards with his tattoos, heavy furs and even heavier eyeshadow, Cruise clearly relishes the opportunity to play against type even as he sends up his world's-biggest-movie-star identity, displaying a cock-of-the-rock strut that viewers haven't seen since his turn in Magnolia.\"\nCruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child's 2005 novel One Shot. The film was released on December 21, 2012. It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $217 million worldwide. In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski's graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $286 million worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko. In 2014, Cruise starred in the science fiction-action film Edge of Tomorrow, which received positive reviews and grossed over $370 million.\nIn 2015, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced. Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director. The film earned high critical acclaim and was a commercial success. Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff's 1932 horror movie The Mummy. The new film, also titled The Mummy, received negative reviews and disappointed at the box office, though still grossed over $400 million. In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, Mission: Impossible – Fallout. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series and grossed over $791 million at the box office. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise's biggest commercial success to date.\n\n\n=== 2020s: Franchise films ===\nIn May 2020, it was reported that Cruise would be starring in and producing a movie shot in outer space. Doug Liman would be directing, writing, and co-producing. Both will fly to the International Space Station as part of a future Axiom Space mission in a SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft. In May 2021, Cruise protested against the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) by returning all three of his Golden Globe Awards in light of controversy surrounding the HFPA, particularly its lack of diversity, specifically no black members, and ethical questions related to financial benefits to some of its members.\n\nIn 2022, Cruise reprised his role as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell in Top Gun: Maverick, a film which he also produced. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where Cruise earned an Honorary Palme d'Or. The film was released to widespread critical praise, with many reviewers deeming it superior to its predecessor. The film broke several box office records upon its release; earning over $1 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of his career. Cruise earned $100 million for the film, when combining ticket sales, his salary, and his cut of home entertainment rentals and streaming revenues.\nCruise reprised his role as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One which was released in theaters on July 12, 2023. The film received critical acclaim, but was a box office disappointment due to the box-office and cultural phenomenon dubbed Barbenheimer, which was the same-day release of Christopher Nolan's historical epic film Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's fantasy comedy Barbie. Peter Debruge of Variety praised Dead Reckoning for its performances, action sequences and a satisfying ending, writing, \"This outing may be one-half of a two-part finale, but it gives audiences enough closure to stand on its own\". In 2024, he appeared in the Paris 2024 Olympics closing ceremony to promote Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympics, by jumping from the roof of the Stade de France stadium in Paris. He took the flag from Mayor Karen Bass and athlete Simone Biles.\nCruise reprised the role of Ethan Hunt in the second part, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, released in May 2025. Cruise also declared it would be the last film in which he would portray Ethan Hunt. He will also star in an untitled film directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu which will be his first film at Warner Bros. Pictures in twelve years.\n\n\n== Production ==\nCruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993, and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer. In addition, Cruise has produced films in which he does not appear in, namely The Others, Shattered Glass, Elizabethtown, Narc, Ask the Dust, and Without Limits.\nCruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as \"one of the most powerful—and richest—forces in Hollywood.\" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.\n\n\n=== Break with Paramount ===\n\nOn August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In The Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount's parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views. Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms. Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.\n\n\n=== Management of United Artists ===\nIn November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists (UA). Cruise acted as a producer and starred in films for UA, while Wagner served as UA's chief executive. Production began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by UA. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of UA. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at UA; she retained her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise's share amounted to 30% of the studio.\n\n\n=== Return to Paramount ===\nCruise began working with Paramount again as a producer and star with Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, without Wagner, which was a critical and commercial success. He and Wagner would collaborate for the final time on the modestly successful Jack Reacher series, also for Paramount.\n\n\n=== Move to Warner Bros. Discovery ===\nIn January 2024, it was announced that his production company was forming a new strategic partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery to develop and produce original and franchise films.\n\n\n== Acting credits and accolades ==\n\nIn 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood's most powerful actor, as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine's 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor. The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as the world's most powerful celebrity. The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the \"two stars, it doesn't matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up.\" October 10, 2006, was declared \"Tom Cruise Day\" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because of \"his love for and close association with Japan.\"\n\nWhile reviewing Days of Thunder (co-written Cruise), film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the \"Tom Cruise Picture\". Ebert listed nine key ingredients that make up the Tom Cruise Picture: the Cruise character, the mentor, the superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in, the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise's later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula. Widescreenings compares two of these Cruise characters in an article on the film A Few Good Men:\n[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.\n\nCruise is an aerobatic pilot and was inducted as part of the Living Legends of Aviation in 2010, receiving the Aviation Inspiration and Patriotism Award from the Kiddie Hawk Air Academy. In addition to other aircraft, Cruise owns a P-51 Mustang.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Marriages and relationships ===\nCruise splits his time between homes in Beverly Hills, California; Clearwater, Florida; and the south of England, where he has lived in various places such as Central London, Dulwich, East Grinstead, and Biggin Hill. In the early-to-mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with Melissa Gilbert, Rebecca De Mornay, Patti Scialfa, and Cher.\n\nCruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987. They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers had grown up in Scientology and was one of its \"auditors\"; they met when Cruise became one of her clients. In a 1993 Playboy interview, Rogers discussed her split from Cruise and said that he had been considering becoming a monk, which affected their intimacy. Rogers later retracted the comments and claimed she had been misinterpreted. According to a friend of Rogers, \"Tom, his agents and certain studios were furious about what Mimi said in Playboy. She was told in no uncertain terms that her career would be over unless she put things right.\" Rogers received a $4 million divorce settlement.\nCruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). On February 5, 2001, the couple's spokesperson announced their separation. Cruise filed for divorce two days later, and their marriage was dissolved later that year, with Cruise citing irreconcilable differences. Kidman stated that their marriage failed because at the time, she \"was a child\" who \"needed to grow up.\" According to former church spokesperson and board member Mike Rinder, the Church of Scientology used various means to push the couple to break up, including pressuring Cruise into more auditing and tapping Kidman's phone.\nIn a 2007 interview with Marie Claire, Kidman noted the incorrect reporting of a miscarriage early in her marriage: \"It was wrongly reported as miscarriage by everyone who picked up the story. So it's huge news, and it didn't happen. I had a miscarriage at the end of my marriage, but I had an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of my marriage.\"\nCruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in Vanilla Sky (2001). Their three-year relationship ended in 2004. An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair stated that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, Scientologist leaders launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of \"auditions\" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with Iranian-British actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology. Scientology and Cruise's lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of \"shoddy journalism\" and \"religious bigotry\". Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.\n\nIn April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes—dubbed TomKat by the media—made their first public appearance together in Rome. A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show; he jumped on Winfrey's yellow couch and stood there to make the announcement. On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child. In April 2006, their daughter Suri was born.\nOn November 18, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century castle Castello Orsini-Odescalchi in Bracciano, in a Scientologist ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars. Their publicists said the couple had \"officialized\" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony. There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by Church of Scientology. David Miscavige, the head of Scientology, served as Cruise's best man. On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise. On July 9, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers. New York law requires all divorce documents remain sealed, so the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available. Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple's daughter Suri from Scientology and that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the organization.\n\n\n=== Litigation ===\nIn 1998, Cruise successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality. In May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise, and Slater was ordered to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment, and in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after he admitted that his claims were false.\nCruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis for $100 million, because Davis had alleged that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual. In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.\nIn 2009, magazine editor Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise's behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on Sapir's claim. In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style magazines for defamation after they claimed Cruise had \"abandoned\" his six-year-old daughter. During deposition, Cruise admitted that \"he didn't see his daughter for 110 days\". The suit was settled the following year.\n\n\n=== Scientology advocacy ===\nCruise was converted to Scientology by his first wife, Mimi Rogers, in 1986 and became an outspoken advocate for Church of Scientology in the 2000s. His involvement in the organization was leaked by the tabloid Star in 1990, and he publicly announced he followed Scientology in a 1992 interview with Barbara Walters. Cruise has said that Scientology, through its teaching method Study Technology, helped him overcome his dyslexia. Cruise has been a close friend of Scientology leader David Miscavige since the 1980s.\nSeveral years after Cruise started studying Scientology, the organization's leaders promised to share some Scientology secrets with him, including information about the extraterrestrial ruler Xenu. According to Janet Reitman's book Inside Scientology: The Story of America's Most Secretive Religion (2011), Cruise \"freaked out\" and took a step back from the Church to work on the film Eyes Wide Shut. In 1999, Marty Rathbun was sent by David Miscavige to convince Cruise to return to the Church and continue his studies. Cruise later sparked controversy in the 2000s with his efforts to promote Scientology.\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City rescue workers \"detoxification therapy\", drawing criticism from medical professionals and firefighters. In late 2004, David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise for this work. Former Scientologist Paul Haggis has claimed that Cruise attempted to convert several celebrities to Scientology, including James Packer, Victoria and David Beckham, Jada Pinkett, Will Smith, and Steven Spielberg. Since 2008, Cruise has restricted interviewers from asking him about Scientology.\n\n\n==== Political lobbying ====\nAs well as promoting various programs to introduce people to Scientology, Cruise campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Council of Paris revealed that Cruise had lobbied French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and Senate President Jean-Claude Gaudin; they described Cruise as a militant spokesman for Scientology and barred any further dealings with him.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nIn 2025, Cruise was selected by President Donald Trump for the Kennedy Center Honors but he declined it.\n\n\n=== Controversies ===\n\n\n==== Criticism of psychiatry ====\n\nIn January 2004, Cruise said, \"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\" In 2005, he criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an antidepressant which she used to recover from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. In response, Shields argued that Cruise \"should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.\" This led to a heated argument between Cruise and Matt Lauer on NBC's Today on June 24, 2005.\nMedical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. From The Lancet, \"He may be right that psychotropic drugs are overused, sometimes misused; and that lifestyle changes (and exercise for depression) can be helpful. But he is wrong, as a celebrity, to add to the burden of those with a mental illness, who often fear seeking or continuing treatment because of the stigma still attached to their condition.\" Shields called Cruise's comments \"a disservice to mothers everywhere\". In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.\nScientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and psychoactive drugs that are routinely prescribed for treatment. It was reported that Cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.\n\n\n==== YouTube video removal ====\n\nOn January 15, 2008, a video produced by Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube by the Anonymous-linked group Project Chanology, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him. Church of Scientology said the video had been \"pirated and edited\", and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology. YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of June 2020, the video has achieved over 15 million views.\n\n\n==== Purported influence ====\nIn March 2004, Cruise's publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise's next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, his sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005. DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan. Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.\nLawrence Wright's 2013 book Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief and Alex Gibney's 2015 documentary adaptation of the book cast a spotlight on Cruise's role in Scientology. The book and the film both state that the Scientology organization groomed romantic partners for Cruise and that Cruise used Sea Org and Rehabilitation Project Force workers as a source of free labor. In the film, Cruise's former auditor Marty Rathbun says that Cruise's then-wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Cruise's suggestion, which Cruise's lawyer denies. Cruise's ex-girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi later compared the Scientology organization's auditioning of women to date Cruise and experiences with him to \"white slavery\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nMiles Fisher – American actor and notable Cruise impersonator\nSupercouple\nTom Cruise: Unauthorized (1998)\nTom Cruise: All the World's a Stage (2006)\nTom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography (2008)\nTom Cruise Purple\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMorton, Andrew (2008).

        "title": "2026 FIFA World Cup",
        "content": "The 2026 FIFA World Cup, marketed as FIFA World Cup 26, will be the 23rd FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international men's soccer championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The tournament will take place from June 11 to July 19, 2026. It will be jointly hosted by 16 cities in three North American countries; the main host country of matches is the United States, while Canada and Mexico will be the auxiliary hosts. The tournament will be the first to be hosted by three nations.\nThis tournament will be the first to include 48 teams, expanded from 32. The United 2026 bid beat a rival bid by Morocco during a final vote at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. It will be the first World Cup since 2002 to be hosted by more than one nation. With its past hosting of the 1970 and 1986 tournaments, Mexico will become the first country to host or co-host the men's World Cup three times. The United States last hosted the men's World Cup in 1994, whereas it will be Canada's first time hosting or co-hosting the men's tournament. The event will also return to its traditional northern summer schedule after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was held in November and December.\nAs the host nations, Canada, Mexico, and the United States all automatically qualified. Of the 13 teams that have qualified to date, 10 had also appeared in the 2022 edition, while Jordan and Uzbekistan will make their World Cup debuts.\nArgentina is the defending champion, having won its third title in 2022.\n\n\n== Format and expansion ==\nThe general idea of expanding the tournament had been suggested as early as 2013 by then-UEFA president Michel Platini, and also in 2016 by FIFA president Gianni Infantino. Opponents of the proposal argued that the number of games played was already at an unacceptable level, that the expansion would dilute the quality of the games, and that the decision was driven by political rather than sporting concerns, accusing Infantino of using the promise of bringing more countries to the World Cup to win his election.\nStarting with this edition, the FIFA World Cup expanded to 48 teams, an increase of 16 from the previous 7 tournaments. The teams will be split into 12 groups of 4 teams, with the top 2 of each group and the 8 best third-placed teams progressing to a new round of 32, as approved by the FIFA Council on March 14, 2023. This is set to be the first expansion and format change since 1998.\nThe total number of games played will increase from 64 to 104, and the number of games played by teams reaching the final four will increase from seven to eight. The tournament will last 39 days, an increase from 32 days of the 2014 and 2018 tournaments. Each team will still play three group matches. The final matchday at club level for players named in the final squads is May 24, 2026; clubs have to release their players by May 25, with exceptions granted to players participating in continental club competition finals up until May 30. The 56 days of the combined rest, release, and tournament periods remains identical to the 2010, 2014 and 2018 tournaments.\n\n\n=== Previous expansion formats ===\nThe expansion to 48 teams had already been approved on January 10, 2017, when it was decided that the tournament would include 16 groups of 3 teams, and 80 matches in total, with the top two teams of each group progressing to a round of 32. Under this later-superseded format, the maximum number of games per team would have remained at seven, but each team would have played one fewer group match than before. The tournament still would have been completed within 32 days. The later-superseded format was chosen over three other proposals, ranging from 40 to 48 teams, from 76 to 88 matches, and from one to four minimum matches per team.\nCritics of the later-superseded format argued that the use of three-team groups with two teams progressing significantly increased the risk of collusion between teams. This prompted FIFA to suggest that penalty shoot-outs may be used to prevent draws in the group stage, although even then some risk of collusion would remain, and a possibility would emerge of teams deliberately losing shootouts to eliminate a rival. To address these concerns, FIFA continued considering alternative formats – a process that ended with the 2023 announcement that the format would be 12 groups of 4 teams.\n\n\n== Host selection ==\n\nThe FIFA Council went back and forth between 2013 and 2017 on limitations within hosting rotation based on the continental confederations. Originally, it was set that bids to be host would not be allowed from countries belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments. It was temporarily changed to only prohibit countries belonging to the confederation that hosted the previous World Cup from bidding to host the following tournament, before the rule was changed back to its prior state of two World Cups.\nThe FIFA Council made an exception to potentially grant eligibility to member associations of the confederation of the second-to-last host of the FIFA World Cup in the event that none of the received bids fulfill the strict technical and financial requirements. In March 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed that \"Europe (UEFA) and Asia (AFC) are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022 respectively.\" Therefore, the 2026 World Cup could be hosted by one of the remaining four confederations: CONCACAF (North America; last hosted in 1994), CAF (Africa; last hosted in 2010), CONMEBOL (South America; last hosted in 2014), or OFC (Oceania, never hosted before), or potentially by UEFA in case no bid from those four met the requirements.\nCo-hosting the FIFA World Cup—which had been banned by FIFA after the 2002 World Cup—was approved for the 2026 World Cup, though not limited to a specific number but instead evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Also for 2026, the FIFA general secretariat, after consultation with the Competitions Committee, had the power to exclude bidders who did not meet the minimum technical requirements to host the competition.\nCanada, Mexico, and the United States had all publicly considered bidding for the tournament separately, but the United joint bid was announced on April 10, 2017. In March 2022, Liga MX president Mikel Arriola claimed Mexico's involvement as cohost could have been at risk if the league and the federation had not responded quickly to the Querétaro–Atlas riot between rival fans that left 26 spectators injured and resulted in 14 arrests. Arriola said FIFA was \"shocked\" by the incident but Infantino was satisfied with the sanctions handed down against Querétaro.\n\n\n=== Voting ===\n\nThe voting took place on June 13, 2018, during the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow, and it was opened to all 203 eligible members. The United bid won with 134 valid ballots, while the Morocco bid received 65 valid ballots. Iran voted for the option \"None of the bids\", while Cuba, Slovenia, and Spain abstained from voting. Ghana was suspended by FIFA due to a corruption scandal and was therefore ineligible to vote.\n\n\n== Venues ==\n\nDuring the bidding process, 41 cities with 43 existing, fully functional venues with regular tenants (except Montreal) and 2 venues under construction submitted to be part of the bid (3 venues in 3 cities in Mexico; 9 venues in 7 cities in Canada; 38 venues in 34 cities in the United States). A first-round elimination cut nine venues and nine cities. A second-round elimination cut an additional nine venues in six cities, while three venues in three cities (Chicago, Minneapolis, and Vancouver) dropped out due to FIFA's unwillingness to discuss financial details. After Montreal dropped out in July 2021 due to lack of provincial funding and support to renovate the Olympic Stadium, Vancouver rejoined the bid as a candidate city in April 2022, bringing the total number to 24 venues, each in its own city or metropolitan area.\nOn June 16, 2022, the sixteen host cities (2 in Canada, 3 in Mexico, 11 in the United States) were announced by FIFA: Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Guadalajara, Kansas City, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Monterrey, Mexico City, Toronto, Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Miami. Eight of the sixteen chosen stadiums have permanent artificial turf surfaces that are planned to be replaced with grass under the direction of FIFA and a University of Tennessee–Michigan State University research team. Four venues (Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Vancouver) are indoor stadiums that use retractable roof systems, all equipped with climate control while a fifth, Los Angeles, is open-air but has a translucent roof and no climate control. The host of the final match—MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey—was announced by FIFA on February 4, 2024.\nAlthough there are soccer-specific stadiums in Canada and the United States, the largest dedicated soccer-specific stadium in the U.S., Geodis Park in Nashville, Tennessee, seats 30,000, which falls short of FIFA's minimum of 40,000 (Toronto's BMO Field is being expanded from 30,000 to 45,500 for this tournament). Stadiums including Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and Lumen Field in Seattle are used by National Football League (NFL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) teams. Although primarily used for gridiron football, with the American stadiums hosting NFL teams and Canada's hosting the Canadian Football League (CFL), all of the Canadian and American stadiums have been used on numerous occasions for soccer and are also designed to host that sport.\nMexico City is the only capital of the three host nations chosen as a venue site, with Ottawa and Washington, D.C., joining Bonn (West Germany, 1974) and Tokyo (Japan, 2002) as the only capital cities not selected to host World Cup matches. Washington was a host city candidate, but due to the poor state of FedExField, it combined its bid with nearby Baltimore's, which was unsuccessful. Other cities eliminated from the final hosting list were Cincinnati, Denver, Nashville, Orlando, and Edmonton. Ottawa's candidate venue, TD Place Stadium, was eliminated early on due to insufficient capacity. None of the stadiums used in the 1994 FIFA World Cup will be used in this tournament, and Estadio Azteca is the only stadium in this tournament that was used in the 1970 and 1986 FIFA World Cups.\nDue to FIFA's rules on stadium sponsorships, the venues will use alternative names for the duration of the tournament, given here in parentheses.\n\nA † denotes a stadium used for previous men's World Cup tournaments.\nA ‡ denotes an indoor stadium with a fixed or retractable roof with interior climate control.\n\n\n=== Team base camps ===\nBase camps will be used by the 48 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n=== Qualification ===\n\nThe United Bid personnel anticipated that all three host countries would be awarded automatic berths. On August 31, 2022, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed that six CONCACAF teams will qualify for the World Cup, with Canada, Mexico, and the United States automatically qualifying as hosts. This was confirmed by the FIFA Council on February 14, 2023.\nImmediately prior to the 67th FIFA Congress, the FIFA Council approved the slot allocation in a meeting in Manama, Bahrain. This includes an intercontinental playoff tournament involving six teams to decide the last two FIFA World Cup spots.\nThe six teams in the playoffs will comprise one team from each confederation excluding UEFA, and one additional team from the confederation of the host countries (CONCACAF). Two of the teams will be seeded based on the World Rankings, and they will play the winners of two knockout games between the four unseeded teams for the two FIFA World Cup berths. The four-game tournament is to be played in one or more of the host countries, and will also be used as a test event for the FIFA World Cup. The ratification of slot allocation also gives the OFC a guaranteed berth in the final tournament for the first time: the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the first tournament in which all six confederations have at least one guaranteed berth. This will also be the first time since the 2010 edition in which all continents have a team qualified for the World Cup finals.\nEritrea withdrew from qualification prior to playing any matches, due to concerns that players would seek political asylum if allowed to travel overseas. Congo, drawn in the same group as Eritrea, was suspended on February 6, 2025, due to government interference in FECOFOOT operations. CAF initially cancelled Congo's remaining matches. However, Tanzania and Zambia were later awarded 3–0 victories by forfeit. The suspension was lifted by FIFA on May 14, 2025.\nOf the 13 teams that have qualified to date, 10 had also appeared in the 2022 edition. New Zealand returns to the tournament having last appeared in 2010, while Jordan and Uzbekistan will make their World Cup debuts. Notable absences include Chile, the 2015 and 2016 Copa América winners, missing its third consecutive World Cup.\nThe teams that have qualified to date, sorted by region:\n\n\n=== Draw ===\nThe draw will take place at 12:00 UTC−5 (EST) on December 5, 2025, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. The four winners of the UEFA playoffs and the two winners of the inter-confederation playoffs will not be known at the time of the draw, as these matches are scheduled to take place in March 2026.\nAs it has already been confirmed that the first game of the tournament will take place at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, Mexico has been automatically placed in Group A. Canada will play the second match and has been placed in Group B, while the United States will play the third match and is in Group D.\n\n\n== Match schedule ==\nThe match schedule, without group assignments, was announced on February 4, 2024. On June 13, 2024, FIFA released an updated match schedule, with specific pairings assigned to venues for knockout stage matches. In addition, group stage matches were assigned to specific groups (though match pairings for non-host groups will not be assigned to specific fixtures until after the final draw).\nThe opening match was announced to include Mexico, taking place on June 11, 2026, at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. The opening match involving Canada will take place on June 12 at BMO Field in Toronto, while the opening game for the United States will take place on the same day at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. Each host nation was scheduled to play its three matches in the group stage within its own country.\nAT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will host the most matches of any venue at the tournament with nine. MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will host the final on July 19. The United States will host 78 matches, including from the quarter-final stage onward, while Canada and Mexico will each host 13. Each tournament venue, except for the Estadio Akron, will host at least one knockout stage fixture. The match schedule will overlap with the 2026 CFL season, resulting in scheduling conflicts and loss of home games for the Toronto Argonauts and BC Lions.\nHost cities were geographically grouped to optimize travel for teams and fans, with the exception of Canada and its opponent for the opening game in Toronto. Cities were split into three regions:\n\nWestern Region (Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles)\nCentral Region (Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City)\nEastern Region (Atlanta, Miami, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, New York/New Jersey).\nFour out of 12 groups were allocated for the Central region, three groups in the Western region, a shared-region group with Canada and the rest in the Eastern region.\n\n\n== Group stage ==\n\nPrior to the final draw, stadiums were assigned to specific groups. Following the final draw, pairings will be allocated to specific matches, and the kickoff times will be confirmed.\n\n\n=== Group A ===\n\n\n=== Group B ===\n\n\n=== Group C ===\n\n\n=== Group D ===\n\n\n=== Group E ===\n\n\n=== Group F ===\n\n\n=== Group G ===\n\n\n=== Group H ===\n\n\n=== Group I ===\n\n\n=== Group J ===\n\n\n=== Group K ===\n\n\n=== Group L ===\n\n\n=== Ranking of third-placed teams ===\n\nThe specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depend on which eight third-placed teams qualify for the round of 32. The 495 possible combinations were published in Annex C of the tournament regulations.\n\n\n== Knockout stage ==\n\n\n=== Bracket ===\n\n\n=== Round of 32 ===\n\n\n=== Round of 16 ===\n\n\n=== Quarterfinals ===\n\n\n=== Semifinals ===\n\n\n=== Third place playoff ===\n\n\n=== Final ===\n\n\n== Marketing ==\n\n\n=== Branding ===\nThe official emblem and brand identity was unveiled on May 17, 2023, at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California; its basic form consists of a stacked \"26\" with an image of the FIFA World Cup Trophy in front of it (marking the first time that the trophy has been depicted in a World Cup emblem as a photo, as opposed to a stylized representation), but it is designed to be adaptable to different backdrops. The next day, FIFA unveiled variants of the emblem for each of the host cities, which feature color variants and designs that reflect local landscapes or culture (with the Los Angeles emblem featuring a stylized sun and wave, the Monterrey emblem featuring imagery of the Cerro de la Silla mountain, and Toronto featuring the city skyline and the CN Tower).\nReaction to the logo from the initial unveiling was largely negative, with many feeling that the design was either unfinished or uncreative compared to the emblems of past FIFA World Cup tournaments. By contrast, United States national team player Jesús Ferreira described the emblem as \"beautiful\".\n\n\n=== Broadcasting rights ===\n\nOn February 12, 2015, FIFA renewed the U.S. and Canadian broadcasting rights contracts for Fox (U.S. English), NBCUniversal (U.S. Spanish), and Bell Media (Canada) to cover 2026, without accepting any other bids. A report in The New York Times asserted that this extension was intended as compensation for the rescheduling of the 2022 World Cup to November–December rather than its traditional June–July scheduling, as it created considerable conflicts with major professional sports leagues that are normally in their offseasons during the World Cup.\nThe International Broadcast Center (IBC) will be located at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in Dallas.\n\n\n=== Sponsorships ===\n\n\n=== City sponsors ===\n\n\n=== FIFA fan festivals ===\nFIFA will stage fan festivals in cities across the host nations, featuring matches on giant screens and live entertainment. Among the confirmed fan fest locations are Liberty State Park in Jersey City, Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, Fort York and The Bentway in Toronto, and East Downtown Houston.\n\n\n== Tickets ==\n\n\n=== Dynamic pricing ===\nTicket prices for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will range initially from $60 for group stage matches to $6,730 for the final—largely increased from the USD equivalent of $69 to $1,607 in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, in September 2025, FIFA confirmed it would use dynamic pricing for tickets for the first time, following the practice used in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. Dynamic pricing means ticket prices can rise or fall depending on demand for any given match. \n\n\n=== Ticket availability ===\nHospitality seats were made available in April 2025 via FIFA's ticket partner for the event. An initial draw period for non-hospitality seats will occur between September 10–19 and will be limited to Visa cardholders. A second phase is expected to run from October 27–31 and a third phase will start after the final draw of teams on December 5. Sales will be capped at four tickets per person per match, and no person will be able to purchase more than 40 tickets for the totality of the tournament. FIFA is also expected to start an official resale platform.\n\n\n== Symbols ==\n\n\n=== Match ball ===\nOn May 2, 2025, reports surfaced that the match ball would be \"Adidas Trionda\". The design featured red, green, and blue (the three colors representing Canada, Mexico, and the United States), as well as a wave connecting each of the colors, hence the name meaning the Spanish words for three (tri) and wave (onda).\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nOn May 17, 2023, the official theme song of the tournament was released, an instrumental track simply titled \"FIFA World Cup 26 Theme Song\". In March 2025, sixteen remixes of theme were released which featured artists from each host city giving their own local spin to the song.\nThe remixers for each city were:\n\nAtlanta – Dallas Austin\nBoston – Ben Zakharenko, Dayvin, Berklee College of Music\nDallas – Tre Nagella\nGuadalajara – Bautista\nHouston – Bombón\nKansas City – Tech N9ne\nLos Angeles – DJ Flict\nMexico City – Mexican Institute of Sound\nMiami – Mr. NaisGai\nMonterrey – Toy Selectah\nNew York/New Jersey – Take a Daytrip\nPhiladelphia – DJ Jazzy Jeff\nSan Francisco Bay Area – Dan the Automator\nSeattle – Sango\nToronto – Hill Kourkoutis\nVancouver – Grayson Repp\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Climate concerns ===\nIn January 2025, Queen's University Belfast warned about potential heat risks for most of the host cities and urged FIFA to schedule match kickoffs later into the afternoon or evening, stating that the wet-bulb globe temperature in certain host cities was higher than that of Qatar in the winter. Concerns have also been raised by climate activists about the environmental impact of both the expansion to 48 teams as well as traveling between host cities, most of which will require extensive air travel and increase carbon emissions, a counter to one of FIFA's goals on sustainability. During the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, which was also hosted in the United States, several matches reported high temperatures ranging from 90 to 102 °F (32 to 39 °C) and weather delays. A report by Scientists for Global Responsibility in July 2025 calculated that the amount of greenhouse gas emissions for the tournament would make it one of the most polluting events in the world as it would be almost double the average for the last four tournaments (2022 reportedly had 5.25 million metric tons (5.79 million short tons)), roughly the same amount as 6.5 million cars driven for a year.\n\n\n=== Labor rights concerns in Mexico ===\nIn March 2025, the trade union Building and Wood Workers' International (BWI) accused FIFA of blocking a planned labor inspection at Mexico City's Estadio Azteca, which is undergoing renovations in preparation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.  According to BWI, FIFA's intervention prevented inspectors from evaluating working conditions at the site, raising concerns about potential labor rights violations similar to alleged instances of slave labor at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\n\n=== Human rights concerns in the United States ===\nOn June 11, 2025, the Sports & Rights Alliance, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International called on FIFA to ensure that human rights in the United States were upheld during the tournament, especially in light of the use of force during the anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles where journalists and protesters were attacked by local police. The groups also called on the United States to ensure that LGBTQ rights were upheld during the tournament in light of the Trump administration's erosion of said rights.\n\n\n=== United States immigration enforcement ===\nDuring the bidding process, President Donald Trump's executive orders regarding immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries implemented during his first term were touted as a potential risk. Infantino stated, \"any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup.\" In response, the Trump administration sent letters to FIFA that read, in part, that Trump was \"confident\" that \"all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.\"\nConcerns around the staging of the tournament were also raised due to the immigration policy of the second Donald Trump administration. In response, Vice President JD Vance said, \"Of course, everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event, but when the time is up, they’ll have to go home. Otherwise, they’ll have to talk to [Homeland Security] Secretary [Kristi] Noem.\" In June 2025, a second travel ban was enacted, though it contains an exemption for athletes and their support teams entering the United States for events such as the FIFA World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting events as determined by the Secretary of State.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2027 FIFA Women's World Cup\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nFIFA World Cup 2026, FIFA.com",

        "title": "Michael Jackson",
        "content": "Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the \"King of Pop\", he is widely regarded as one of the most culturally significant figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his music achievements broke racial barriers in America and made him a dominant figure worldwide. Through his songs, stages, and fashion, he proliferated visual performance for artists in popular music, popularizing street dance moves such as the moonwalk, the robot and the anti-gravity lean. Jackson is often deemed the greatest entertainer of all time based on his acclaim and records.\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his public debut at age six as the lead singer of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons), one of Motown's most successful acts. His breakthrough as a solo artist came with the disco-inspired album Off the Wall (1979). Jackson achieved unprecedented global success with Thriller (1982), the best-selling album in history. Its short film-style music videos for \"Thriller\", \"Beat It\", and \"Billie Jean\" popularized MTV and redefined music videos as an art form. He followed it with Bad (1987), the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\", \"Bad\", \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", \"Man in the Mirror\", and \"Dirty Diana\". Dangerous (1991) and HIStory (1995) explored social themes, and Invincible (2001) delved into personal themes.\nFrom the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. He was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend in 1993. In 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and all other charges. While preparing for a series of comeback concerts, he died in 2009 from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. His televised memorial service, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was estimated to have been viewed by more than 2.5 billion people.\nJackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 500 million records worldwide. He has 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles—a joint-record for a male solo artist—and is the first artist to have a top-ten single on the chart in five different decades. Jackson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame. One of the most-awarded artists in popular music, his accolades include 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award; 26 American Music Awards, including Artist of the Century; 12 World Music Awards; six Brit Awards; the Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award and three presidential honors. As a philanthropist, Jackson donated an estimated $500 million to charity throughout his lifetime. In 2024, half of his music catalogue sold to Sony for $600 million, the largest music acquisition for a single artist in history.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early life and the Jackson 5 (1958–1975) ===\n\nMichael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet, cello, and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joe Jackson, was a former boxer, crane operator at US Steel, and guitarist for local rhythm and blues band the Falcons. Joe's great-grandfather, July \"Jack\" Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after his birth.\nIn 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine. Michael said his father physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals; he recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand, ready to punish any mistakes. Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied that their father was abusive and said that the whippings, which had a deeper impact on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. Michael said that during his youth he was lonely and isolated.\nLater in 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5. In 1965, the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to Robert Parker's 1965 song \"Barefootin'\" and sang the Temptations' \"My Girl\". From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the Midwest; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the Chitlin' Circuit as the opening act for artists such as Sam & Dave, the O'Jays, Gladys Knight and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances. In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.\n\nThe Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, Steeltown Records; their first single, \"Big Boy\", was released in 1968. Bobby Taylor of Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers brought the Jackson 5 to Motown after they opened for Taylor at Chicago's Regal Theater in 1968. Taylor produced some of their early Motown recordings, including a version of \"Who's Lovin' You\". After signing with Motown, the Jackson family relocated to Los Angeles. In 1969, Motown executives decided Diana Ross should introduce the Jackson 5 to the public—partly to bolster her career in television—sending off what was considered Motown's last product of its \"production line\". The Jackson 5 made their first television appearance in 1969 in the Miss Black America pageant, performing a cover of \"It's Your Thing\". Rolling Stone later described the young Michael as \"a prodigy\" with \"overwhelming musical gifts\" who \"quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer\".\n\nIn January 1970, \"I Want You Back\" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100; it stayed there for four weeks. Three more singles with Motown topped the chart: \"ABC\", \"The Love You Save\", and \"I'll Be There\". In May 1971, the Jackson family moved into a large house at Hayvenhurst, a 2-acre (0.81 ha) estate in Encino, California. During this period, Michael developed from a child performer into a teen idol. Between 1972 and 1975, he released four solo studio albums with Motown: Got to Be There (1972), Ben (1972), Music & Me (1973) and Forever, Michael (1975). \"Got to Be There\" and \"Ben\", the title tracks from his first two solo albums, sold well as singles, as did a cover of Bobby Day's \"Rockin' Robin\".\nMichael maintained ties to the Jackson 5. The Jackson 5 were later described as \"a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists\". They were frustrated by Motown's refusal to allow them creative input. Jackson's performance of their top five single \"Dancing Machine\" on Soul Train popularized the robot dance.\n\n\n=== Move to Epic and Off the Wall (1975–1981) ===\n\nThe Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975, signing with Epic Records and renaming themselves the Jacksons. Their younger brother Randy joined the band around this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and pursued a solo career. The Jacksons continued to tour internationally, and released six more albums between 1976 and 1984. Michael, the group's main songwriter during this time, wrote songs such as \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\" (1978), \"This Place Hotel\" (1980), and \"Can You Feel It\" (1980).\nIn 1977, Jackson moved to New York City to star as the Scarecrow in The Wiz, a musical film directed by Sidney Lumet, alongside Diana Ross, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross which was a box-office failure. The film's score was arranged by Quincy Jones, who later produced three of Jackson's solo albums. During his time in New York, Jackson frequented the Studio 54 nightclub, where he heard early hip hop; this influenced his beatboxing on future tracks such as \"Working Day and Night\".\nJackson's fifth solo album and first album as an adult, Off the Wall (1979), established him as a solo performer and helped him move from the bubblegum pop of his youth to more complex sounds. It produced four top 10 entries in the US: \"Off the Wall\", \"She's Out of My Life\", and the chart-topping singles \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" and \"Rock with You\". The album reached number three on the US Billboard 200 and sold over 20 million copies worldwide. He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for 1979 with \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\". At the American Music Awards during the 1980s, he won Favorite Soul/R&B Single for \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" and two consecutive awards for Favorite Soul/R&B Album as well as Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist. In 1981, Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist.\nJackson felt Off the Wall should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release. In 1980, he secured the highest royalty rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit.\n\n\n=== Thriller, Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever and Pepsi incident (1982–1984) ===\n\nFrom 1981 to 1983, Jackson recorded demos of \"State of Shock\", \"Victory\" and \"There Must Be More to Life Than This\" with Queen's lead singer Freddie Mercury planned for a duet album. The project was never completed; “State of Shock” was later recorded with Mick Jagger for the Jacksons' album Victory (1984), and “There Must Be More to Life Than This” was released posthumously in 2014. In 1982, Jackson contributed \"Someone in the Dark\" to the audiobook for the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\nJackson's sixth studio album, titled Thriller, was released on November 29, 1982. It was the best-selling album worldwide in 1983; it eventually became the best-selling album of all time in the US and the best-selling album in history worldwide, selling an estimated 70 million copies. It topped the Billboard 200 chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of the 200 for 80 consecutive weeks. It was the first album to produce seven Billboard Hot 100 top-10 singles, including the number-one songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\".\nOn March 25, 1983, Jackson reunited with his brothers for Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16 to an estimated audience of 47 million, and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. Jackson's solo performance of \"Billie Jean\" earned him his first Emmy Award nomination. Wearing a glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his moonwalk dance, which Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier, and it became his signature dance in his repertoire. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to the show, believing he had been doing too much television. At the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he performed in exchange for an opportunity to do a solo performance. His performance was heavily praised: Rolling Stone's Mikal Gilmore called the performance \"extraordinary\"; Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times praised the perfect timing and technique involved in the dance; and Gordy was \"mesmerized\" by the performance.\nAt the 26th Annual Grammy Awards, Jackson received 12 nominations, the most in a single night (later tied with Babyface), and won 8 awards, breaking the record for most wins in a single night (later tied by Santana). Thriller received 13 nominations, the most for any album, and won 8 awards, including Best Engineered Recording (Non-Classical) for Bruce Swedien's work. Jackson won seven awards related to the album, including Album of the Year for Thriller and Record of the Year for \"Beat It\", and also won an award for the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. At the 11th Annual American Music Awards, Jackson won another eight awards and became the youngest artist to win the Award of Merit. He also won Favorite Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R&B Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Artist. \"Beat It\" won Favorite Soul/R&B Video, Favorite Pop/Rock Video and Favorite Pop/Rock Single. The album won Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album. Thriller's sales doubled after the release of an extended music video, Michael Jackson's Thriller, which sees Jackson dancing with a horde of zombies.\n\nThe success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture, and the album \"conquered racial divides\". Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point, with about $2 for every album sold (equivalent to $6 in 2024), and was making record-breaking profits. Dolls modeled after Jackson appeared in stores in May 1984 for $12 each. In the same year, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, a documentary about the music video, won a Grammy for Best Music Video (Longform). Time described Jackson's influence at that point as \"star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too.\" The New York Times wrote \"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\".In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a $5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement (equivalent to $15.8 million in 2024). The first Pepsi campaign, which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its \"New Generation\" theme, included tour sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and suggested using his song \"Billie Jean\", with revised lyrics, as its jingle.\nOn January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million (equivalent to $4.5 million in 2024) settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its now-closed Michael Jackson Burn Center was named in his honor. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for $10 million (equivalent to $27.7 million in 2024). The second campaign covered 20 countries and provided financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–1988 world tour. Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, but none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi.\nThe Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated $3 to 5 million, to charity. During the last concert of the Victory Tour at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Jackson announced his split from the Jacksons during \"Shake Your Body\".\n\n\n=== \"We Are the World\" and other commercial activities (1985) ===\n\nWith Lionel Richie, Jackson co-wrote the charity single \"We Are the World\" (1985), which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned $63 million (equivalent to $184 million in 2024), and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammy Awards in 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie. Jackson, Jones, and the promoter Ken Kragen received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.\nJackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making $40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \"Everyday People\" (1968), Len Barry's \"1-2-3\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \"The Wanderer\" (1961) and \"Runaround Sue\" (1961). In 1984, Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4,000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material. In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million ($40 million) (equivalent to $138 million in 2024). Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million (equivalent to $139 million in 2024) on November 20, 1984. When Jackson and McCartney were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, and did not pursue an offer on his own. Jackson's agents were unable to come to a deal, and in May 1985 left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of due diligence work on the negotiations.\n\nIn June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman's and Martin Bandier's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative offer to buy ATV Music for $50 million; in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson's increased bid of $47.5 million (equivalent to $139 million in 2024) was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence. Jackson agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. His purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985.\n\n\n=== Increased tabloid speculation (1986–1987) ===\n\nJackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including speculation that he had been bleaching his skin. His dermatologist, Arnold Klein, said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had vitiligo, a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. He also identified discoid lupus erythematosus in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year, and with vitiligo in 1986. Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup, and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams, to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would depigment the blotches, and, with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his vitiligo, adding, \"When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me.\" He became friends with Klein and Klein's assistant, Debbie Rowe. Rowe later became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his first two children.\nIn his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview, Jackson said he had had two rhinoplasty surgeries and a cleft chin surgery but no more than that. He said he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet to achieve a dancer's body. Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from anorexia nervosa. Periods of weight loss became a recurring problem later in his life. After his death, Jackson's mother said that he first turned to cosmetic procedures to remedy his vitiligo, because he did not want to look like a \"spotted cow\". She said he had received more than the two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he had become addicted to them.\nIn 1986, it was reported that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow aging. He denied the story, although it was alleged that Jackson leaked an image of him sleeping in a glass chamber (according to Jackson, this was a promotional shot from an upcoming space opera featuring himself) to The National Enquirer. It was also reported that Jackson took female hormone shots to keep his voice high and facial hair wispy, proposed to Elizabeth Taylor and possibly had a shrine of her, and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes. Jackson's manager Frank DiLeo denied all of them, except for Jackson having a chamber. DiLeo added \"I don't know if he sleeps in it. I'm not for it. But Michael thinks it's something that's probably healthy for him. He's a bit of a health fanatic.\"\nWhen Jackson took his pet chimpanzee Bubbles to tour in Japan, the media portrayed Jackson as an aspiring Disney cartoon character who befriended animals. It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the \"Elephant Man\"). In June 1987, the Chicago Tribune reported Jackson's publicist bidding $1 million for the skeleton to the London Hospital Medical College on his behalf. The college maintained the skeleton was not for sale. DiLeo said Jackson had an \"absorbing interest\" in Merrick, \"purely based on his awareness of the ethical, medical and historical significance\".\nJackson worked with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute $30 million 3D film Captain EO, which ran from 1986 at Disneyland and Epcot, and later at Tokyo Disneyland and Euro Disneyland. After having been removed in the late 1990s, it returned to the theme park for several years after Jackson's death. As a Jehovah's Witness, Jackson would evangelize door-to-door while donning a disguise.\nIn 1987, Ebony reported that Jackson had disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses. Katherine Jackson said this might have been because some Witnesses strongly opposed the Thriller video, which Michael denounced in a Witness publication in 1984. While former members are usually shunned by their families, Jackson's mother kept in contact with him. In 2001, Jackson told an interviewer he was still a Jehovah's Witness.\n\n\n=== Bad, autobiography, and Neverland (1987–1990) ===\n\nJackson released his first album in five years on August 31, 1987, titled Bad. With a highly anticipated release, Bad sold over 2.25 million copies in its first week in the U.S., debuting at number one on the Billboard 200; it remained atop the chart for six weeks. It became the first album to produce five US number-one singles: \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\", \"Bad\", \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", \"Man in the Mirror\", and \"Dirty Diana\". Another song, \"Smooth Criminal\", peaked at number seven.\nBad won the 1988 Grammy for Best Engineered Recording – Non Classical and the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Short Form for \"Leave Me Alone\". Jackson won an Award of Achievement at the American Music Awards in 1989 after Bad generated five number-one singles, became the first album to top the charts in 25 countries and the best-selling album worldwide in 1987 and 1988. The Bad tour ran from September 12, 1987, to January 27, 1989. In Japan, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the previous record for a single tour. The 504,000 people who attended seven sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium set a new Guinness World Record. Bad cemented Jackson's status as a dominant music force; the album has sold over 35 million copies worldwide, which ranks it amongst the best-selling albums of all time.\nIn 1988, Jackson released his autobiography, Moonwalk, with input from Stephen Davis and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It sold 200,000 copies, and reached the top of The New York Times Best Seller list. Jackson discussed his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the abuse from his father. He attributed his changing facial appearance to three plastic surgeries, puberty, weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hairstyle, and stage lighting. In June, Jackson was honored with the Grand Vermeil Medal of the City of Paris by the then Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac during his stay in the city as part of the Bad tour. On July 20, he became the first commoner in history to enter London's Guildhall through the building's Royal Entrance. In October, Jackson released a film, Moonwalker, which featured live footage and short films starring Jackson and Joe Pesci. In the US it was released direct-to-video and became the best-selling video cassette in the country. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it as eight times Platinum in the US.\nIn March 1988, Jackson purchased 2,700 acres (11 km2) of land near Santa Ynez, California, to build a new home, Neverland Ranch, at a cost of $17 million (equivalent to $45 million in 2024). He installed a Ferris wheel, a carousel, a movie theater and a zoo. A security staff of 40 patrolled the grounds. Shortly afterwards, he appeared in the first Western television advertisement in the Soviet Union. Jackson became known as the \"King of Pop\", a nickname that Jackson's publicists embraced. When Elizabeth Taylor presented him with the Soul Train Heritage Award in 1989, she called him \"the true king of pop, rock and soul.\" President George H. W. Bush designated him the White House's \"Artist of the Decade\". At the 38th BMI Awards in 1990, Jackson was the first person to be honored with an award named after its recipient. From 1985 to 1990, Jackson donated $455,000 to the United Negro College Fund, and all profits from his single \"Man in the Mirror\" went to charity. His rendition of \"You Were There\" at Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th birthday celebration won Jackson a second Emmy nomination. Jackson was the best-selling artist of the 1980s.\n\n\n=== Dangerous and public social work (1991–1993) ===\n\nIn March 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65 million (equivalent to $150 million in 2024), a record-breaking deal at the time. In 1991, he released his eighth album, Dangerous, co-produced with Teddy Riley. It was certified eight times platinum in the US, and by 2018 had sold 32 million copies worldwide. In the US, the first single, \"Black or White\", was the album's highest-charting song; it was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks and achieved similar chart performances worldwide. The second single, \"Remember the Time\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. At the end of 1992, Dangerous was the best-selling album of the year worldwide and \"Black or White\" the best-selling single of the year worldwide at the Billboard Music Awards. In 1993, he performed \"Remember the Time\" at the Soul Train Music Awards in a chair, saying he twisted his ankle during dance rehearsals. In the UK, \"Heal the World\" made No. 2 on the charts in 1992.\nJackson founded Heal the World Foundation in 1992. The charity brought underprivileged children to Jackson's ranch to use the theme park rides, and sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. That July, Jackson published his second book, Dancing the Dream, a collection of poetry. Jackson embarked on the Dangerous World Tour, his second world tour, to raise money for his Heal the World Foundation.  The tour ran from June 1992 to November 1993, grossing $100 million (equivalent to $220 million in 2024) from 69 concerts outside the US, attracting over 3.5 million people. Jackson sold the broadcast rights for his October 1, 1992, concert in Bucharest to HBO for $20 million (equivalent to $45 million in 2024), then the highest fee ever paid for a concert performer to appear on television. He donated a portion of the fee to aid Romanian children.\nFollowing the death of HIV/AIDS spokesperson and friend Ryan White, Jackson pleaded with the Clinton administration at Bill Clinton's inaugural gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research and performed \"Gone Too Soon\", a song dedicated to White, and \"Heal the World\" at the gala. Jackson visited Africa in early 1992; on his first stop in Gabon he was greeted by more than 100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read \"Welcome Home Michael\", and was awarded an Officer of the National Order of Merit from President Omar Bongo. During his trip to Ivory Coast, Jackson drew larger crowds than Pope John Paul II on his previous visits. He was crowned \"King Sani\" by a tribal chief in the Ivorian village of Krindjabo, where he thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed documents formalizing his kingship, and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances.\nIn January 1993, Jackson performed at the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show in Pasadena, California. The NFL sought a big-name artist to keep ratings high during halftime following dwindling audience figures. With 133.4 million viewers, it was the first Super Bowl whose halftime show drew greater audience figures than the game. Jackson played \"Jam\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Black or White\", and \"Heal the World\". Dangerous rose 90 places in the US albums chart after the performance.\nJackson gave a 90-minute interview with Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993. He spoke of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood, and said that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated for the first time that he had vitiligo. After the interview, Dangerous re-entered the US albums chart in the top 10, more than a year after its release. The interview itself became the most-watched television interview in United States history to date, with more than 90 million viewers.\nIn January 1993, Jackson won three American Music Awards: Favorite Pop/Rock Album (Dangerous), Favorite Soul/R&B Single (\"Remember the Time\"), and was the first to win the International Artist Award of Excellence. In February, he won the \"Living Legend Award\" at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. He attended the award ceremony with Brooke Shields. Dangerous was nominated for Best Vocal Performance (for \"Black or White\"), Best R&B Vocal Performance (\"Jam\") and Best R&B Song (\"Jam\"), and Bruce Swedien and Teddy Riley won the Grammy for Best Engineered – Non Classical.\n\n\n=== First child sexual abuse accusations and first marriage (1993–1995) ===\n\nIn 1993, Jackson befriended 13-year-old Jordan Chandler through the boy's stepfather, whom he met after renting a vehicle from him. On July 8, 1993, Evan Chandler, Jordan's father and a Los Angeles dentist, was recorded threatening to \"destroy\" Jackson's career with a \"carefully planned plot, with people in place ready to set it in motion\" if Jackson did not meet his demands: \"If I go through with this, I win big-time. There’s no way I lose\". On July 9, Jackson's investigator, Anthony Pellicano, met Jordan, who denied any abuse or inappropriate touching by Jackson. Evan Chandler's lawyer would later call Beverly Hills psychiatrist Dr. Mathis Abrams and present him with a hypothetical situation. In reply and without having met either Jordan Chandler or his parents, Abrams sent Rothman a two-page letter in which he states that \"reasonable suspicion would exist that sexual abuse may have occurred\". After receiving the letter from Dr. Abrams, Evan Chandler allegedly received a confession from his son Jordan, and demanded $20 million from Jackson on August 4, 1993, without going to law enforcement regarding the reports of the abuse that was claimed to have taken place, but Jackson refused. From August 9–13, 1993, Evan Chandler and his legal team made various counter-offers to secure a settlement from Jackson, escalating their financial demands after his refusal to pay the initial $20 million, with Evan later filing a civil suit in September demanding $30 million for alleged damages which were all denied by Jackson, prompting Chandler to go public with the claims of child molestation. Jackson's older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile; she later retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her abusive husband.\nProsecutors raided Neverland Ranch and other places of residency while Jackson was on tour in August, but no leads were found as the investigators ruled that there was no medical or physical evidence. Hundreds of children were interviewed; all denied abuse or improper behavior. Attention was later brought to two legal art books depicting featuring young boys playing, running, and swimming in various states of undress, however Jackson denied knowing of the books' content and claimed if they were there, someone had to have sent them to him and he did not open them. No child pornography or other incriminating evidence was found. In December 1993, Prosecutor Thomas W. Sneddon Jr. filed a court order to conduct a strip search of Jackson, based on a drawing provided by the accuser and submitted to authorities. According to Reuters and USA Today, the description of Jackson's genitalia did not match the photographs taken during the police investigation. Prosecutors sought testimony from Jackson's doctors and family members. The grand jury subsequently subpoenaed Jackson's mother, reportedly to assess whether there were any physical alterations compared to the description. In November 1993, Jackson requested that the civil trial be postponed until after the criminal hearing was completed due to a violation of his civil rights, under the circumstances of having to defend himself under double jeopardy. This motion was denied and in January 1994, the civil lawsuit was settled for $15,331,250, with separate payments of $1.5 million for Evan and June Chandler coming out to a total of $18.3 million allocated to the Chandler family, lower than the initial demand of $20–30 million requested by Evan Chandler. The document shows that the Chandlers dropped the child molestation allegations from their complaint with Jackson's settlement being filed over claims of negligence. It was later revealed that this settlement did not prevent the Chandlers from testifying in the criminal case The police never pressed criminal charges. The prosecution continued to investigate Jackson from January to June 1994 with Jordan Chandler continuing to co-operate with investigators. By July 1994 multiple grand juries had been called; jurors remarked that no damaging evidence was heard against Jackson. \"The [Santa Barbara] grand jury in Michael Jackson's case was dismissed and one juror said he heard no evidence against [Jackson]... Another juror told CNN that he heard no evidence against him [Jackson] during the hearing.\" On September 21, 1994, after 400 witnesses had been investigated with another 30 called in front of the grand juries, the investigation was closed. A few potential leads had been found but all of them turned out to be false.\nJackson had been taking painkillers for his reconstructive scalp surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations. On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous World Tour due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked his close friend Elizabeth Taylor for support, encouragement and counsel. The end of the tour concluded his sponsorship deal with Pepsi.\nIn late 1993, Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Elvis Presley, over the phone. They were married in La Vega, Dominican Republic, in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Álvarez Pérez. The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect away from Jackson's sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley's career as a singer. Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December 1995. Presley cited \"irreconcilable differences\" when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as her settlement. After the divorce, Judge Pérez said, \"They lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year and a half.\" Presley later said she and Jackson had attempted to reconcile intermittently for four years following their divorce, and that she had traveled the world to be with him.\nJackson composed music for the Sega Genesis video game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), but left the project around the time the sexual abuse allegations surfaced and went uncredited. Jackson's involvement was the subject of fan speculation for decades until Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka confirmed it in 2022. Sega Technical Institute director Roger Hector and Sonic co-creator Naoto Ohshima said that Jackson was terminated and his music reworked following the allegations. However, Jackson's musical director Brad Buxer and other members of Jackson's team said he went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the Genesis replicated his music. The game's credits theme served as the basis for Jackson's 1996 song \"Stranger in Moscow\".\n\n\n=== HIStory, second marriage, fatherhood and Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1995–1997) ===\n\nIn June 1995, Jackson released the double album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a greatest hits album (reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I). The second disc, HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for eight million shipments in the US. It is on of the best-selling album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold worldwide. HIStory received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. The New York Times reviewed it as \"the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent\".\nThe first single from HIStory was \"Scream/Childhood\". \"Scream\", a duet with Jackson's youngest sister Janet, protests the media's treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a Grammy nomination for \"Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals\". The second single, \"You Are Not Alone\", holds the Guinness world record for the first song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It received a Grammy nomination for \"Best Pop Vocal Performance\" in 1995.\nIn 1995 the Anti-Defamation League and other groups complained that \"Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me\", the original lyrics of \"They Don't Care About Us\", were antisemitic. Jackson released a revised version of the song. In late 1995, Jackson was admitted to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a stress-related panic attack. In November, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony's music publishing division, creating Sony/ATV Music Publishing. He retained ownership of half the company, earning $95 million up front (equivalent to $196 million in 2024) as well as the rights to more songs.\n\"Earth Song\" was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the UK Singles Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995. It became the 87th-best-selling single in the UK. At the 1996 Brit Awards, Jackson's performance of \"Earth Song\" was disrupted by Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker, who was protesting what Cocker saw as Jackson's \"Christ-like\" persona. Jackson said the stage invasion was \"disgusting and cowardly\".\nIn 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, for \"Scream\" and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist. In July 1996, Jackson performed for Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's fiftieth birthday at Jerudong Park Amphitheater, which was specifically built for that birthday concert. Jackson was reportedly paid $17 million (equivalent to $34 million in 2024). Jackson promoted HIStory with the HIStory World Tour, from September 7, 1996, to October 15, 1997. He performed 82 concerts in five continents, 35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans, his most attended tour. It grossed $165 million (equivalent to $323 million in 2024). During the tour, in Sydney, Australia, Jackson married Debbie Rowe, a dermatology assistant, who was six months pregnant with his first child.\nMichael Joseph Jackson Jr. (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997. His sister Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born on April 3, 1998. Jackson and Rowe divorced in 2000, Rowe conceded custody of the children, with an $8.5 million settlement (equivalent to $15.5 million in 2024). In 2004, after the second child abuse allegations against Jackson, she returned to court to reclaim custody. The suit was settled in 2006.\nIn 1997, Jackson released Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix, which contained remixes of singles from HIStory and five new songs. Worldwide sales stand at 6 million copies, making it the best-selling remix album. It reached number one in the UK, as did the single \"Blood on the Dance Floor\". In the US, the album reached number 24 and was certified platinum.\n\n\n=== Label dispute and Invincible (1997–2002) ===\nFrom October 1997 to September 2001, Jackson worked on his tenth solo album, Invincible, which cost $30 million (equivalent to $53.3 million in 2024) to record, making it the most expensive album of all time. In June 1999, Jackson joined Luciano Pavarotti for a War Child benefit concert in Modena, Italy. The show raised a million dollars for refugees of the Kosovo War, and additional funds for the children of Guatemala. Later that month, Jackson organized a series of \"Michael Jackson & Friends\" benefit concerts in Germany and Korea. Other artists involved included Slash, The Scorpions, Boyz II Men, Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, A. R. Rahman, Prabhu Deva Sundaram, Shobana, Andrea Bocelli and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO. In 1999, Jackson was presented with the \"Outstanding Humanitarian Award\" at Bollywood Movie Awards in New York City where he noted Mahatma Gandhi to have been an inspiration for him. From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 East 74th Street. At the turn of the century, Jackson was awarded with the Artist of the 1980s Decade Award at the 27th American Music Awards, and the Best Selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium Award at the 12nd World Music Awards. In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.\nIn September 2001, two concerts were held at Madison Square Garden to mark Jackson's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured Mýa, Usher, Whitney Houston, Destiny's Child, Monica, Liza Minnelli and Slash. The first show was marred by technical lapses, and the crowd booed a speech by Marlon Brando. 45 million people watched the television broadcast of the shows in November according to Nielsen Media Research. After the September 11 attacks (in which Jackson narrowly avoided death by oversleeping and missing a scheduled meeting at the World Trade Center), Jackson helped organize the United We Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 2001. Jackson performed \"What More Can I Give\" as the finale.\nThe release of Invincible was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits, but clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract. Invincible was released on October 30, 2001. It was Jackson's first full-length album in six years, and the last album of original material he released in his lifetime. It debuted at number one in 13 countries, and went on to sell eight million copies worldwide, receiving double-platinum certification in the US.\nOn January 9, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the Century. Later that year, an anonymous surrogate mother gave birth to his third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (nicknamed \"Blanket\"), who had been conceived by artificial insemination. On November 20, Jackson briefly held Blanket over the railing of his Berlin hotel room, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson apologized for the incident, calling it \"a terrible mistake\". On January 22, promoter Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against Jackson for failing to perform two planned 1999 concerts. In March, a Santa Maria jury ordered Jackson to pay Avram $5.3 million (equivalent to $9.3 million in 2024). On December 18, 2003, Jackson's attorneys dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.\nOn April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at Apollo Theater. The concert was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and former President Bill Clinton. The money collected would be used to encourage citizens to vote. It raised $2.5 million (equivalent to $3.8 million in 2024). The concert was called Michael Jackson: Live at the Apollo and was one of Jackson's final on-stage performances.\nIn July 2002, at Al Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem, Jackson called the Sony Music chairman Tommy Mottola \"a racist, and very, very, very devilish\", and accused him of exploiting black artists for his own gain. The accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition investigating whether Mottola exploited black artists. Jackson charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a \"fat nigger\". Sony issued a statement calling the accusations \"ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful\" and said Mottola had championed Jackson's career for years. Sony refused to renew Jackson's contract and said that a $25 million (equivalent to $43.7 million in 2024) promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the US for Invincible.\n\n\n=== Documentary, Number Ones, second child abuse allegations and acquittal (2002–2005) ===\n\nBeginning in May 2002, a documentary film crew led by Martin Bashir followed Jackson for several months. The documentary, broadcast in February 2003 as Living with Michael Jackson, showed Jackson holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a twelve-year-old boy. He discussed seeing nothing wrong with having sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and bedroom with various people, which aroused controversy. He insisted that the sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood.\nIn October 2003, Jackson received the Key to the City of Las Vegas from Mayor Oscar Goodman. On November 18, 2003, Sony released Number Ones, a greatest hits album. It was certified five times platinum by the RIAA, and ten times platinum in the UK, for shipments of at least 3 million units.\n\nOn December 18, 2003, Santa Barbara authorities charged Jackson with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of intoxicating a minor with alcoholic drinks. Jackson denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty. The People v. Jackson trial began on January 31, 2005, in Santa Maria, California, and lasted until the end of May. Jackson found the experience stressful and it affected his health. If convicted, he would have faced up to twenty years in prison. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts. FBI files on Jackson, released in 2009, revealed the FBI's role in the 2005 trial and the 1993 allegations, and showed that the FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf.\n\n\n=== Final years, financial problems, Thriller 25 and This Is It (2005–2009) ===\n\nAfter the trial, Jackson became reclusive. In June 2005, he moved to Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah. In early 2006, it was announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain startup, Two Seas Records. Nothing came of the deal, and the Two Seas CEO, Guy Holmes, later said it was never finalized. Holmes also found that Jackson was on the verge of bankruptcy and was involved in 47 ongoing lawsuits. By September 2006, Jackson was no longer affiliated with Two Seas.\nIn April 2006, Jackson agreed to use a piece of his ATV catalog stake, then worth about $1 billion, as collateral against his $270 million worth of loans from Bank of America. Bank of America had sold the loans to Fortress Investments, an investment company that buys distressed loans, the year before. As part of the agreement, Fortress Investments provided Jackson a new loan of $300 million with reduced interest payments (equivalent to $470 million in 2024). Sony Music would have the option to buy half of his stake, or about 25% of the catalog, at a set price. Jackson's financial managers had urged him to shed part of his stake to avoid bankruptcy. The main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in Bahrain at the hospitality of Abdullah. At least thirty of Jackson's employees had not been paid on time and were owed $306,000 in back wages. Jackson was ordered to pay $100,000 in penalties. Jackson never returned to Neverland after his acquittal.\nIn mid-2006, Jackson moved to Grouse Lodge, a residential recording studio near Rosemount, County Westmeath, Ireland. There, he began work on a new album with the American producers will.i.am and Rodney Jenkins. That November, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath. On November 15, Jackson briefly joined in on a performance of \"We Are the World\" at the World Music Awards in London, his last public performance, and accepted the Diamond Award for sales of 100 million records. He returned to the US in December, settling in Las Vegas. That month, he attended James Brown's funeral in Augusta, Georgia, where he gave a eulogy calling Brown his greatest inspiration.\n\nIn 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music publishing company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. The deal gave Jackson the rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others. In a brief interview, Jackson said he had no regrets about his career despite his problems and \"deliberate attempts to hurt me\". That March, Jackson visited a US Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet more than 3,000 troops and their families. As of September, Jackson was still working on his next album, which he never completed.\nIn 2008, for the 25th anniversary of Thriller, Jackson and Sony released Thriller 25, with two remixes released as singles: \"The Girl Is Mine 2008\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008\". Thriller 25 was the last recorded work released during his life which he was extensively involved with, with Jackson co-producing the album's remix tracks. For his 50th birthday, Sony BMG released a series of greatest hits albums, King of Pop, with different tracklists for different regions. That July, Fortress Investments threatened to foreclose on Neverland Ranch, which he had used as collateral for his loans. Fortress sold Jackson's debts to Colony Capital LLC. In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC. The deal earned him $35 million. In 2009, Jackson arranged to sell a collection of his memorabilia of more than 1,000 items through Julien's Auction House, but canceled the auction in April.\nIn March 2009, amid speculation about his finances and health, Jackson announced a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, at a press conference at the O2 Arena. The shows were to be his first major concerts since the HIStory World Tour in 1997. Jackson suggested he would retire after the shows. The initial plan was for ten concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and Mumbai. Randy Phillips, the president and chief executive of AEG Live, predicted the first ten dates would earn Jackson £50 million.\nThe London residency was increased to fifty dates after record-breaking ticket sales; more than one million were sold in less than two hours. The concerts were to run from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. Jackson moved to Los Angeles, where he rehearsed in the weeks leading up to the tour under the direction of the choreographer Kenny Ortega, whom he had worked with during his previous tours. Rehearsals took place at the Forum and the Staples Center owned by AEG. By this point, Jackson's debt had grown to almost $500 million. By the time of his death, he was three or four months behind payments on his home in San Fernando Valley. The Independent reported that Jackson planned a string of further ventures designed to recoup his debts, including a world tour, a new album, films, a museum and a casino.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nOn June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before his concert residency was due to begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from cardiac arrest, caused by a propofol and benzodiazepine overdose. Conrad Murray, his personal physician, had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:21 pm Pacific time (19:21 UTC) and arrived at the property four minutes later. Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed. Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and for more than an hour after Jackson's arrival there, but were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC). Murray had administered propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam; Jackson's death was caused by a propofol overdose.\nNews of his death spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down and crash from user overload, and it put unprecedented strain on many services and websites including Google, AOL Instant Messenger, Twitter and Wikipedia. Overall, web traffic rose by between 11% and 20%. MTV and BET aired marathons of Jackson's music videos, and Jackson specials aired on television stations around the world. MTV briefly returned to its original music video format, and they aired hours of Jackson's music videos, with live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities.\n\n\n=== Memorial service ===\n\nJackson's memorial was held on July 7, 2009, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, preceded by a private family service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park's Hall of Liberty. Over 1.6 million fans applied for tickets to the memorial; the 8,750 recipients were drawn at random, and each received two tickets. The memorial service was one of the most watched events in streaming history, with an estimated US audience of 31.1 million and a worldwide audience of an estimated 2.5 to 3 billion.\nMariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Jennifer Hudson, and Shaheen Jafargholi performed at the memorial, and Smokey Robinson and Queen Latifah gave eulogies. Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: \"Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway.\" Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she addressed the crowd. Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer. On September 3, 2009, the body of Jackson was entombed at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\n\n=== Criminal investigation and prosecution of Conrad Murray ===\n\nIn August 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide. Law enforcement officials charged Murray with involuntary manslaughter on February 8, 2010. In late 2011, he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and held without bail to await sentencing. Murray was sentenced to four years in prison, but was released after one year and eleven months.\n\n\n=== Posthumous sales ===\nAt the 2009 American Music Awards, Jackson won four posthumous awards, including two for his compilation album Number Ones, bringing his total American Music Awards to 26. In the year after his death, more than 16.1 million copies of Jackson's albums were sold in the US alone, and 35 million copies were sold worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009. He became the first artist to sell one million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads. Thriller, Number Ones and The Essential Michael Jackson became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album. Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top-20 best-selling albums in a single year in the US. Within the year following his death, Jackson sold over 75 million records worldwide. By the end of 2013, Jackson had sold over 50 million albums worldwide since his death.\nFollowing the surge in sales, in March 2010, Sony Music signed a $250 million deal (equivalent to $360 million in 2024) with the Jackson estate to extend their distribution rights to Jackson's back catalog until at least 2017; it had been due to expire in 2015. It was the most expensive music contract for a single artist in history. They agreed to release ten albums of previously unreleased material and new collections of released work. The deal was extended in 2017. That July, a Los Angeles court awarded Quincy Jones $9.4 million of disputed royalty payments for Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad. In July 2018, Sony/ATV bought the estate's stake in EMI for $287.5 million.\nIn 2015,Thriller became the first album to be certified for 30 million shipments by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A year later, it was certified 33× platinum after Soundscan added streams and audio downloads to album certifications.\nIn February 2024, Sony Music acquired half of Michael Jackson's publishing rights and recording masters for $600 million. The deal includes assets from Jackson's Mijac publishing catalog, but excludes royalties from several Jackson-related productions, such as the MJ Broadway musical and the Michael biopic. This transaction is possibly the largest for a single musician's work.\n\n\n=== Posthumous releases and productions ===\nJackson's posthumous releases and productions are administered by the estate of Michael Jackson, which owns Jackson's trademarks and rights to his name, image and likeness. The first posthumous Jackson song, \"This Is It\", co-written in the 1980s with Paul Anka, was released in October 2009. The surviving Jackson brothers reunited to record backing vocals. It was followed by a documentary film about the rehearsals for the canceled This Is It tour, Michael Jackson's This Is It, and a compilation album. Despite a limited two-week engagement, the film became the highest-grossing documentary or concert film ever, with earnings of more than $260 million worldwide. Jackson's estate received 90% of the profits. In late 2010, Sony released the first posthumous album, Michael, and the lead single \"Hold My Hand\", a duet with Akon. The Jackson collaborator will.i.am expressed disgust, saying that Jackson would not have approved the release.\nThe video game developer Ubisoft released a music game featuring Jackson for the 2010 holiday season, Michael Jackson: The Experience. It was among the first games to use Kinect and PlayStation Move, the motion-detecting camera systems for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\nIn October 2011, the theater company Cirque du Soleil launched Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour, a $57-million in Montreal. A larger and more theatrical Cirque show, Michael Jackson: One, designed for residency at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas, opened on May 23, 2013, in a renovated theater.\nIn 2012, in an attempt to end a family dispute, Jackson's brother Jermaine retracted his signature on a public letter criticizing executors of Jackson's estate and his mother's advisors over the legitimacy of his brother's will. T.J. Jackson, the son of Tito Jackson, was given co-guardianship of Michael Jackson's children after false reports of Katherine Jackson going missing. Xscape, an album of unreleased material, was released on May 13, 2014. The lead single, a duet between Jackson and Justin Timberlake, \"Love Never Felt So Good\", reached number 9 on the US Billboard Hot 100, making Jackson the first artist to have a top-10 single on the chart in five different decades.\nLater in 2014, Queen released a duet recorded with Jackson in the 1980s. A compilation album, Scream, was released on September 29, 2017. A jukebox musical, MJ the Musical, premiered on Broadway in 2022. Myles Frost won the 2022 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of Jackson. On November 18, 2022, Epic released a 40th-anniversary edition reissue of Thriller. A biographical film based on Jackson's life, Michael, directed by Antoine Fuqua, is scheduled for release in April 2026. Jackson is played by his nephew Jaafar Jackson. Deadline Hollywood reported that the film \"will not shy away from the controversies of Jackson's life\". Since Jackson's death, his estate has grossed $2 billion in ticket revenue from MJ the Musical, Michael Jackson's This Is It and two Cirque du Soleil productions.\n\n\n=== Posthumous child sexual abuse allegations ===\nIn 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old (1989–1996). In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck, alleging similar sexual abuse over a four-year period starting when Safechuck was ten (1988–1992). Both had previously testified in Jackson's defense during the 1993 allegations; Robson did so again in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed as it had been filed too late. Safechuck's claim was also time-barred.\nIn 2017, it was ruled that Jackson's corporations could not be held accountable for his alleged past actions. The rulings were appealed. On October 20, 2020, Safechuck's lawsuit against Jackson's corporations was again dismissed. The judge ruled that there was no evidence that Safechuck had had a relationship with Jackson's corporation, nor was it proven that there was a special relationship between the two. On April 26, 2021, Robson's case was dismissed because of a lack of supporting evidence that the defendants exercised control over Jackson.\nRobson and Safechuck's allegations were the subject of the documentary film Leaving Neverland, released in March 2019. Radio stations in New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the Netherlands removed Jackson's music from their playlists. Jackson's family condemned the film as a \"public lynching\", and the Jackson estate released a statement calling the film a \"tabloid character assassination [Jackson] endured in life, and now in death\". Close associates of Jackson, such as Corey Feldman, Aaron Carter, Brett Barnes, and Macaulay Culkin, defended Jackson in the wake of the documentary's release, saying that Jackson had never molested them.\nDocumentaries such as Square One: Michael Jackson, Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary and Michael Jackson: Chase the Truth, presented information countering the claims suggested by Leaving Neverland. Jackson's album sales increased following the documentary screenings. Billboard senior editor Gail Mitchell said she and a colleague interviewed about thirty music executives who believed Jackson's legacy could withstand the controversy. In late 2019, some New Zealand and Canadian radio stations re-added Jackson's music to their playlists due to \"positive listener survey results\".\nOn February 21, 2019, the Jackson estate sued HBO for breaching a non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. The suit sought to compel HBO to participate in a non-confidential arbitration that could result in $100 million or more in damages awarded to the estate. HBO said they did not breach a contract and filed an anti-SLAPP motion against the estate. In September 2019, Judge George H. Wu denied HBO's motion to dismiss the case, allowing the Jackson estate to arbitrate. HBO appealed, but in December 2020 the appeals court affirmed Wu's ruling.\nIn 2020, a state law passed in California which granted plaintiffs in child sex abuse cases an additional period to file lawsuits. In October 2020 and again in April 2021, the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled that MJJ Productions Inc. and MJJ Ventures Inc. employees were not legally obligated to protect the two men from Jackson. In August 2023, California's Second District Court of Appeal overturned the ruling, and the case was approved to move forward to trial court.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nJackson has been referred to as the \"King of Pop\" for having transformed the art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation. His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs. Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, leading to the discontinuation of the album-oriented rock format previously dominant on the channel. In songs such as \"Black or White\", \"Heal the World\", \"Earth Song\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice. He is considered one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.\n\nJackson's meteoric rise in the 1980s catapulted him to global stardom, and his influence transcended borders. In Africa, his influence was compared to Nelson Mandela for his ability to inspire and unite diverse audiences through his music. Similarly, in India, Jackson was likened to Mahatma Gandhi, with his art championing themes of social justice and humanitarianism, and his influence extending to Bollywood where it was said that anyone who danced well was compared to Jackson. In Europe, Jackson's impact was compared to that of the Pope; huge crowds gathered to see him in public and even more attended his concerts, which spread messages of love and healing during rough economic and political times. His presence in the Middle East was considered as widespread as Coca-Cola, symbolizing a shared global culture through his music. Additionally, Jackson is considered the backbone of the K-pop industry in South Korea, influencing countless artists and shaping the genre's development. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in the wake of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success—that there weren't a whole lot of artists who weren't trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula.Danyel Smith, chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the editor-in-chief of Vibe, described Jackson as \"the greatest star\". Steve Huey of AllMusic called him \"an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the skills to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power\". BET said Jackson was \"quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time\" whose \"sound, style, movement and legacy continues to inspire artists of all genres\". In 1984, Time pop critic Jay Cocks wrote that Jackson was the biggest phenomenon since the Beatles and Elvis Presley, while possibly \"the most popular black singer ever.\" Cocks declared him a \"star of records, radio, rock video\" and the \"dancer with the fanciest feet.\" In 2003, The Daily Telegraph writer Tom Utley described Jackson as \"extremely important\" and a \"genius\". At Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, Motown founder Berry Gordy called Jackson \"the greatest entertainer that ever lived\". Jackson is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records. He has also appeared on Rolling Stone's lists of the Greatest Singers of All Time.\nCraig Glenday, the Editor-in-Chief of Guinness World Records, called Jackson the most famous person in the world in 2006. Following Jackson's death, Glenday wrote in an obituary that Jackson had maintained this status up until his death, later remarking that his fame had exceeded that of Confucius. The Guardian wrote that he was in a league of his own in terms of fame, noting that Jackson had become so famous that the number of people who might not know who he was had become statistically insignificant. Due to his unprecedented influence, Jackson is recognized today as one of the most globally renowned figures in history. Reports of his fame extend from the Middle East, Africa, India, and China to tribes in the Amazon. His influence even reaches remote corners of the world such as São Tomé and Príncipe, or Tristan da Cunha, where tribute artists keep his legacy alive by celebrating his music.\n\nIn 2018, the National Portrait Gallery named Jackson the most depicted cultural figure of the century, later stating that Jackson's influence on art rivaled that of Jesus Christ. Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery and curator of the Michael Jackson: On the Wall exhibition, described Jackson's impact on art as unprecedented and claimed in 2018 that Jackson was the most depicted figure in the history of contemporary art. In 2014, a comprehensive study conducted by researcher Young-Ho Eom at the University of Toulouse identified Jackson as one of the most influential people of all time. The study utilized advanced ranking methods, including 2D Rank and PageRank algorithms, to analyze the impact of historical figures. Jackson was prominently placed on the list of top influencers, alongside Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, Adolf Hitler, and Jesus Christ. An additional study conducted in 2013 also identified Jackson as one of the most influential people of all time. This study ranked Jackson at the top of the list, alongside Napoleon Bonaparte, highlighting the extraordinary influence and global recognition that Jackson achieved throughout his career. Additionally, numerous publications and academic studies have recognized Michael Jackson as one of the most influential figures in history, noting his impact beyond music in fields such as psychology, law, chemistry, and engineering.\n\n\n== Philanthropy and humanitarian work ==\n\nJackson is widely regarded as having been a prolific philanthropist and humanitarian. Jackson's early charitable work has been described by The Chronicle of Philanthropy as having \"paved the way for the current surge in celebrity philanthropy\", and by the Los Angeles Times as having \"set the standard for generosity for other entertainers\".\nBy some estimates, he donated over $500 million, not accounting for inflation, to various charities over the course of his life. In 1992, Jackson established his Heal the World Foundation, to which he donated several million dollars in revenue from his Dangerous World Tour.\nJackson's philanthropic activities went beyond just monetary donations. He also performed at benefit concerts, some of which he arranged. He gifted tickets for his regular concert performances to groups that assist underprivileged children. He visited sick children in hospitals around the world.\nJackson donated valuable, personal and professional paraphernalia for numerous charity auctions. He received various awards and accolades for his philanthropic work, including two bestowed by presidents of the United States. The vast breadth of Jackson's philanthropic work has earned recognition in the Guinness World Records.\nOn May 14, 1984, President Ronald Reagan gave Jackson an award recognizing his support of alcohol and drug abuse charities, and in recognition of his support for the Ad Council's and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Drunk Driving Prevention campaign. Jackson allowed the campaign to use \"Beat It\" for its public service announcements.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Vocal style ===\n\nJackson was known as an expressive vocalist with absolute pitch. Critics describe his vocal theatricality as having a range from clear and soft to harsh and aggressive, depending on the genre sung. Principally in history, Jackson is the sole recipient to receive Grammy Awards for three different genres of vocal performance (as a soloist), winning Pop Vocal for \"Thriller\", Rock Vocal for \"Beat It\", and Rhythm and Blues Vocal with both \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\". Bruce Swedien, his long-time sound engineer, emphasized that a critical element of their vocal recordings are of him and Jackson trying numerous approaches to rhythmic, emotional and technical distinctions to consummate a \"sonic character\". His stylings, such as common use of staccato, legato, falsetto as well as vocal hiccups, adlibs, wailings and growls, are all signature to his sound.\nJackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy soprano to lyric tenor. He was known for his intonation and vocal range. Through each music release, his vocal development and changes were positively narrated by music journalists. With the arrival of Off the Wall in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities in his coming-of-age period had Rolling Stone comparing his vocals to the \"breathless, dreamy stutter\" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that \"Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very daringly.\" By the time of 1982's Thriller, Rolling Stone wrote that Jackson was singing in a \"fully adult voice\" that was \"tinged by sadness\". The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, \"he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth\" and he had a \"wretched tone\". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to \"smooth\" vocals. Of Invincible, Rolling Stone wrote that, at age 43, Jackson still performed \"exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies\". Joseph Vogel notes Jackson's ability to use non-verbal sounds to express emotion. Neil McCormick wrote that Jackson's unorthodox singing style \"was original and utterly distinctive\".\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nJackson was influenced by musicians including James Brown, Little Richard, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, and David Ruffin. Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, but Brown was his greatest inspiration. When Jackson was a small child, his mother would wake him whenever Brown appeared on television. Jackson described being \"mesmerized\".\nJackson's vocal technique was influenced by Diana Ross; his use of the oooh interjection from a young age was something Ross had used on many of her songs with the Supremes. She was a mother figure to him, and he often watched her rehearse. He said he had learned a lot from watching how she moved and sang, and that she had encouraged him to have confidence in himself.\nChoreographer David Winters, who met Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, said that Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in \"Beat It\" and the \"Bad\" video.\n\n\n=== Musicianship ===\nJackson had no formal music training and could not read or write music notation. He is credited for playing guitar, keyboard, and drums, but was not proficient in them. When composing, he recorded ideas by beatboxing and imitating instruments vocally. Describing the process, he said: \"I'll just sing the bass part into the tape recorder. I'll take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and that's what inspires the melody.\" These were shown in his demos for \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" where he vocalized the melody, bass instrumentals as well as lead and backing vocals by overlaying each component. The engineer Robert Hoffman recalled that after Jackson came in with a song he had written overnight, Jackson sang every note of every chord to a guitar player. Hoffman also remembered Jackson singing string arrangements part by part into a cassette recorder.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\nJackson danced from a young age as part of the Jackson 5, and incorporated dance extensively in his performances and music videos. According to Sanjoy Roy of The Guardian, Jackson would \"flick and retract his limbs like switchblades, or snap out of a tornado spin into a perfectly poised toe-stand\". The moonwalk, taught to him by Jeffrey Daniel, was Jackson's signature dance move and one of the most famous of the 20th century. Jackson is credited for coining the name \"moonwalk\" for this street dance move, previously known as the \"backslide\". His other moves included the robot, crotch grab, and the \"anti-gravity\" lean of the \"Smooth Criminal\" video.\n\n\n=== Themes and genres ===\n\nJackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop, and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \"The Lady in My Life\", \"Human Nature\", and \"The Girl Is Mine\", the funk pieces \"Billie Jean\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", and the disco set \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\".\n\nWith Off the Wall, The Guardian's Tom Ewing wrote that Jackson's \"vocal tics – the gasps and shudders that punctuate almost every song\" evoke \"a singer desperate to cut loose and express himself in movement.\" Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that, with Thriller, Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\". In \"Billie Jean\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" he argues against gossip and the media. \"Beat It\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He observed that \"Thriller\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \"We Are the World\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.In Bad, Jackson's concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock song \"Dirty Diana\". The lead single \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is a traditional love ballad, and \"Man in the Mirror\" is a ballad of confession and resolution. \"Smooth Criminal\" is an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that Dangerous presents Jackson as a paradoxical person. The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like \"Jam\" and \"Remember the Time\". It was the first Jackson album in which social ills became a primary theme; \"Why You Wanna Trip on Me\", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as \"In the Closet\". The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as \"Will You Be There\", \"Heal the World\", and \"Keep the Faith\". In the ballad \"Gone Too Soon\", Jackson gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS.\nHIStory creates an atmosphere of paranoia. In the new jack swing-funk rock tracks \"Scream\" and \"Tabloid Junkie\", and the R&B ballad \"You Are Not Alone\", Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs his anger at the media. In the introspective ballad \"Stranger in Moscow\", Jackson laments his \"fall from grace\"; \"Earth Song\", \"Childhood\", \"Little Susie\", and \"Smile\" are operatic pop songs. In \"D.S.\", Jackson attacks lawyer Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse cases; he describes Sneddon as a white supremacist who wanted to \"get my ass, dead or alive\". Invincible includes urban soul tracks such as \"Cry\" and \"The Lost Children\", ballads such as \"Speechless\", \"Break of Dawn\", and \"Butterflies\", and mixes hip hop, pop, and R&B in \"2000 Watts\", \"Heartbreaker\", and \"Invincible\".\n\n\n=== Music videos and choreography ===\nJackson released \"Thriller\", a 14-minute music video directed by John Landis, in 1983. The zombie-themed video \"defined music videos and broke racial barriers\" on MTV, which had launched two years earlier. Before Thriller, Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV, allegedly because he was African American. Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing \"Billie Jean\" and later \"Beat It\", which led to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, and helped other black music artists gain recognition. The popularity of his videos on MTV helped the relatively new channel's viewing figures, and MTV's focus shifted toward pop and R&B. His performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever changed the scope of live stage shows, making it acceptable for artists to lip-sync to music video on stage. The choreography in Thriller has been copied in Indian films and prisons in the Philippines. Thriller marked an increase in scale for music videos, and was named the most successful music video ever by the Guinness World Records.\nIn \"Bad\"'s 19-minute video—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson used sexual imagery and choreography, and touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he said it was spontaneously compelled by the music. Time magazine described the \"Bad\" video as \"infamous\". It featured Wesley Snipes; Jackson's later videos often featured famous cameo roles. For the \"Smooth Criminal\" video, Jackson experimented with leaning forward at a 45-degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe to lock the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted U.S. patent 5,255,452 for the device. The video for \"Leave Me Alone\" was not officially released in the US, but in 1989 was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards and won a Golden Lion Award for its special effects. It won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.\n\nHe received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1988; in 2001 the award was renamed in his honor. The \"Black or White\" video simultaneously premiered on November 14, 1991, in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million people, the largest audience ever for a music video at the time. Along with Jackson, it featured Macaulay Culkin, Peggy Lipton, and George Wendt. It helped introduce morphing to music videos. It was controversial for scenes in which Jackson rubs his crotch, vandalizes cars, and throws a garbage can through a storefront. He apologized and removed the final scene of the video.\n\"In the Closet\" featured Naomi Campbell in a courtship dance with Jackson. \"Remember the Time\" was set in ancient Egypt, and featured Eddie Murphy, Iman, and Magic Johnson. The video for \"Scream\", directed by Mark Romanek and production designer Tom Foden, gained a record 11 MTV Video Music Award Nominations, and won \"Best Dance Video\", \"Best Choreography\", and \"Best Art Direction\". The song and its video are Jackson's response to being accused of child molestation in 1993. A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form. It has been reported as the most expensive music video ever made, at $7 million; Romanek has contradicted this. The \"Earth Song\" video was nominated for the 1997 Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.\nMichael Jackson's Ghosts, a short film written by Jackson and Stephen King and directed by Stan Winston, premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. At over 38 minutes long, it held the Guinness world record for the longest music video until 2013, when it was eclipsed by the video for the Pharrell Williams song \"Happy\". The 2001 video for \"You Rock My World\" lasts over 13 minutes, was directed by Paul Hunter, and features Chris Tucker and Marlon Brando. It won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Music Video in 2002.\nIn December 2009, the Library of Congress selected \"Thriller\" as the only music video to be preserved in the National Film Registry, as a work of \"enduring importance to American culture\". Huey wrote that Jackson transformed the music video into an artform and a promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameos, while breaking down racial barriers.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nJackson is one of the best-selling music artists in history, with sales estimated of over 500 million records worldwide.[Note 2] He had 13 number-one singles in the US over his solo career—more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era at the time of his death. He was invited and honored by a president of the United States at the White House three times. In 1984, he was honored with a \"Presidential Public Safety Commendation\" award by Ronald Reagan for his humanitarian endeavors. In 1990, he was honored as the \"Artist of the Decade\", which was awarded by the National Children's Museum, by George H. W. Bush. In 1992, he was honored as a \"Point of Light Ambassador\" by Bush for inviting disadvantaged children to his Neverland Ranch. \n\nJackson won hundreds of awards and is one of the most-awarded artists in popular music. His awards include 39 Guinness World Records, including the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time, 13 Grammy Awards, as well as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and 26 American Music Awards, including the Artist of the Century and Artist of the 1980s. He also received the World Music Awards' Best Selling Male Artist of the Millennium and the Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award. Jackson was inducted onto the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980 as a member of the Jacksons, and in 1984 as a solo artist. He was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Vocal Group Hall of Fame as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and again as a solo artist in 2001. In 2002, he was added to the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2010, he was the first recording artist to be inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame, and in 2014, he was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. In 2021, he was among the inaugural inductees into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame.\nIn 1988, Fisk University honored him with an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. In 1992, he was invested as a titular king of Sanwi, a traditional kingdom located in the south-east of Ivory Coast. In July 2009, the Lunar Republic Society named a crater on the Moon after Jackson. In August, for what would have been Jackson's 51st birthday, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. In 2012, the extinct hermit crab Mesoparapylocheles michaeljacksoni was named in his honor. In 2014, the British Council of Cultural Relations deemed Jackson's life one of the 80 most important cultural moments of the 20th century. World Vitiligo Day has been celebrated on June 25, the anniversary of Jackson's death, to raise awareness of the auto-immune disorder that Jackson suffered from.\n\n\n== Earnings ==\n\nIn 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at $125 million. Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at $35 million in 1996 and $20 million in 1997. Jackson has been one of the wealthiest celebrities and musical artists; estimates of Jackson's net worth during his life range from negative $285 million to positive $350 million for 2002, 2003 and 2007. Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were $4.2 billion. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He may have earned another $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos.\nIn 2013, the executors of Jackson's estate filed a petition in the United States Tax Court as a result of a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over estate taxes. The executors claimed that it was worth about $7 million, while the IRS that it was worth over $1.1 billion. In February 2014, the IRS reported that Jackson's estate owed $702 million; $505 million in taxes, and $197 million in penalties. In 2021, the Tax Court issued a ruling in favor of the estate, ruling that the estate's total combined value was $111.5 million and that the value of Jackson's name and likeness was $4 million.\nIn 2016, Forbes estimated annual gross earnings by the Jackson estate at $825 million, the largest ever recorded for a celebrity, mostly due to the sale of the Sony/ATV catalog. In 2018, the figure was $400 million, and by 2024, it rose to $600 million, bringing Jackson's postmortem total to $3.3 billion. Forbes has consistently recognized Jackson as one of the top-earning dead celebrities, and placed him at the top spot from 2010 to 2024, except for 2012, 2021, and 2022.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nGot to Be There (1972)\nBen (1972)\nMusic & Me (1973)\nForever, Michael (1975)\nOff the Wall (1979)\nThriller (1982)\nBad (1987)\nDangerous (1991)\nHIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995)\nInvincible (2001)\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\nThe Wiz (1978)\nMichael Jackson's Thriller (1983)\nCaptain EO (1986)\nMoonwalker (1988)\nMichael Jackson: The Legend Continues (1989)\nMichael Jackson's Ghosts (1997)\nMen in Black II (2002)\nMiss Cast Away and the Island Girls (2004)\nMichael Jackson's This Is It (2009)\nBad 25 (2012)\nMichael Jackson's Journey from Motown to Off the Wall (2016)\nThriller 40 (2023)\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\nBad World Tour (1987–1989)\nDangerous World Tour (1992–1993)\nHIStory World Tour (1996–1997)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dancers\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Print sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHidalgo, Susan; Weiner, Robert G.

        "title": "Virginia Giuffre",
        "content": "Virginia Louise Giuffre (; née Roberts; August 9, 1983 – April 25, 2025) was an American-Australian  advocate of justice for survivors of sex trafficking and one of the most prominent and vocal accusers of child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre created Victims Refuse Silence, a non-profit organization in the United States, in 2015, which was relaunched under the name Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR) in November 2021. She gave a detailed account to many American and British reporters about her experiences of being trafficked by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\nGiuffre pursued criminal and civil actions against Epstein and Maxwell, and appealed directly to the public for justice and awareness. She sued Maxwell for defamation in 2015, and the case was settled in Giuffre's favor for an undisclosed sum in 2017. On July 2, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the unsealing of documents from the earlier civil suit by Giuffre against Maxwell. The first batch of documents from Giuffre's suit were released to the public on August 9, 2019, further implicating Epstein, Maxwell, and a number of their associates. The following day, Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan prison cell.\nIn an October 2019 interview for BBC's Panorama, aired on December 2, Giuffre described her experiences of being sex trafficked by Epstein to Britain's Prince Andrew, which helped shift public opinion against the prince. She subsequently sued the prince in civil court in New York. The suit was settled in February 2022, with Prince Andrew paying an undisclosed amount to Giuffre and making a substantial donation to her charity. Giuffre died by suicide in April 2025.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nVirginia Giuffre was born Virginia Louise Roberts in Sacramento, California, on August 9, 1983, to Sky William Roberts and Lynn Trude Cabell. She had two stepbrothers, Sky and Daniel. The family relocated to Loxahatchee in Palm Beach County, Florida, when she was four years old. It was reported that she had come from a \"troubled home\" and, from the age of seven, was molested by a close family friend. \"I was just so mentally scarred already at such a young age, and I ran away from that\", she said on Panorama in 2019. Giuffre told the Miami Herald that she went from being in \"an abusive situation, to being a runaway, to living in foster homes\". She lived on the streets at age 14, where she says she found only \"hunger and pain and [more] abuse\". Later she was abused by a sex trafficker, Ron Eppinger, in Miami. Giuffre lived with Eppinger for approximately 6 months. Eppinger reportedly ran a front business for international sex trafficking known as the modeling agency \"Perfect 10\". He was raided by the FBI and later pleaded guilty to charges of alien smuggling for prostitution, interstate travel for prostitution, and money laundering.\nAt the age of 14, Giuffre reunited with her father and returned to live with him. Her father worked as a maintenance manager at the Mar-a-Lago property owned by Donald Trump, and also helped Giuffre obtain a job there. She attended Royal Palm Beach High School.\n\n\n== Association with Jeffrey Epstein (2000–2002) ==\nIn mid-2000, Giuffre met Ghislaine Maxwell when working as a spa attendant at Donald Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club while reading a book about massage therapy. Maxwell, a British socialite and daughter of the late media tycoon Robert Maxwell, approached Giuffre, noted the book that she was reading, inquired about her interest in massage, and offered her a potential job working for Epstein as a traveling masseuse with the assurance that no experience was necessary. When Giuffre arrived at Epstein's Palm Beach home, she says he was naked lying down and Maxwell told her how to massage him. \"They seemed like nice people so I trusted them, and I told them I'd had a really hard time in my life up until then—I'd been a runaway, I'd been sexually abused, physically abused. ... That was the worst thing I could have told them because now they knew how vulnerable I was\", Giuffre stated. Giuffre stated that after Maxwell introduced her to Jeffrey Epstein, the two quickly began grooming her to provide sexual services under the guise that she was to be trained as a professional massage therapist.\nBetween 2000 and 2002, Giuffre was closely associated with Epstein and Maxwell, traveling between Epstein's residences in Palm Beach and Manhattan (at the Herbert N. Straus House), with additional trips to Epstein's Zorro ranch in New Mexico and private island Little Saint James. In the Miami Herald's investigative journalism series \"Perversion of Justice\", Giuffre describes her experiences of being trafficked by Epstein to provide massages and sexual services for him and a number of his business associates over a two-and-a-half-year period. In her interview with the BBC, Giuffre said she was \"passed around like a platter of fruit\" to Epstein's powerful associates, and taken around the world on private jets.\nOf the instance in March 2001 that Giuffre was allegedly trafficked to Prince Andrew, she stated in an interview that it was a \"wicked\" and \"really scary time\" in her life and that she \"couldn't comprehend how in the highest level of the government powerful people were allowing this to happen. Not just allowing but participating in it\". After visiting a nightclub, Giuffre says Maxwell told her that she, \"had to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey\". In court documents from a civil suit that were released from seal in 2019, Giuffre named several others that she claims Epstein and Maxwell instructed her to have sex with, including hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin, attorney Alan Dershowitz, politician Bill Richardson, MIT scientist Marvin Minsky, lawyer George J. Mitchell, and MC2 modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel. Many of the men denied Giuffre's allegations.\nIn September 2002, at the age of 19, Giuffre flew to Thailand and attended the International Training Massage School in Chiang Mai. Maxwell provided her with tickets to travel to Thailand, and instructed her to meet with a specific Thai girl to bring her back to the United States for Epstein. While at the massage school in Thailand in 2002, she met Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts trainer, and the two married quickly thereafter. She contacted Epstein and informed him that she would not be returning as planned. She and her husband started a life and family in Australia, and Giuffre broke off contact with Epstein and Maxwell. For five years, Giuffre and her husband lived a quiet life in Australia with their young children.\n\n\n=== First contact by authorities ===\nIn March 2005, while Giuffre was still establishing her family in Australia, the Palm Beach Police Department began investigating Epstein after a 14-year-old girl and her parents reported his behavior. The girl described being recruited by a female classmate from her high school to give Epstein a massage at his mansion in exchange for money, wherein he subsequently molested her. By October 2005, the police had a growing list of girls with similar claims of sexual abuse, statements from Epstein's butlers corroborating their claims, and a search warrant for his Palm Beach property.\nPolice detectives noted that the accusers all described a similar pattern where Epstein would ask them to massage him and then sexually assault them during the massage. When police searched through Epstein's trash, they found notes with the telephone numbers of the girls on them. One of the girls was called by Epstein's assistant while being questioned by police.\nGiuffre told the Miami Herald that she received a series of phone calls in rapid succession over three days in 2007. The first call was from Maxwell, then one day later came a call from Epstein, both of whom asked if she had spoken to authorities, followed by a third call from an FBI agent who stated that Giuffre had been identified as a victim during the first criminal case against Epstein. She resisted speaking at length to the FBI until she was approached again about the matter in person, this time by the Australian Federal Police, six months after being contacted by phone.\nPhotos, records and witnesses confirm large parts of Giuffre's statements about her time with Epstein.\n\n\n== Legal proceedings ==\n\n\n=== First criminal case against Epstein ===\nIn 2006, a year before Giuffre was first contacted by authorities, the Palm Beach Police Department had a growing body of evidence against Epstein, and signed a probable cause affidavit charging him with multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor. Epstein hired a team of powerful lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz, Jack Goldberger, Ken Starr, and Jay Lefkowitz, to serve in his defense. As the case progressed, Police Chief Michael Reiter became alarmed at the handling of the case by state prosecutors and then state attorney, Barry Krischer. On May 1, 2006, Reiter asked Krischer to remove himself from the case; when Krischer declined, Police Chief Reiter turned his evidence over to the FBI for federal prosecution. While Reiter was initially hopeful that the FBI would thoroughly investigate and move the matter to a conclusion, in 2007, then South Florida U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta decided not to prosecute Epstein in federal court and referred the matter back to the local jurisdiction.\nLead police detective Joseph Recarey asserted that the state prosecutors were at first eager to pursue criminal action against Epstein, but that \"everything took a turn\" when lawyer Alan Dershowitz got involved. Krischer then decided to take the unusual action of turning Epstein's case over to a grand jury, and then presented testimony from only one girl. Epstein's legal team aggressively sought concessions and prolonged the process when negotiating a plea deal with Acosta. Acosta, who described the tactics of Epstein's lawyers as a \"year-long assault on the prosecution and prosecutors\", eventually agreed to sign a controversial non-prosecution agreement in 2008, which was done without informing the victims, later determined to be in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act.\nReiter expressed that the state and federal prosecutors' handling of the Epstein case amounted to \"the worst failure of the criminal justice system\" in modern times.\n\n\n=== Crime Victims' Rights Act lawsuit (2008–2019) ===\nIn 2008, a lawsuit (Jane Doe v. United States of America) was filed by Bradley Edwards and Paul G. Cassell that accused the U.S. Justice Department of violating the Crime Victims' Rights Act during the first criminal case against Epstein by failing to allow several of his victims to challenge his plea deal. Epstein sued Bradley Edwards for civil racketeering but later dropped his suit; Edwards countersued for malicious prosecution, with the result that Epstein issued a public apology to the lawyer and settled the case for an undisclosed sum in December 2018. Edwards, who represents several Epstein accusers in addition to Giuffre, reportedly settled in aid of his clients, whose greatest wish was to pursue their larger objective of having their allegations heard in a federal court in order to overturn the non-prosecution agreement. Edwards stated that \"They're willing to talk. They want to share their stories. This was part of their healing.\"\nIn a February 2019 ruling, District Judge Kenneth Marra determined that prosecutors had violated victims' rights as defined by the Crime Victims' Rights Act.\n\n\n=== Victims' civil suit ===\nIn May 2009, Giuffre filed a lawsuit as Jane Doe 102 against Epstein and accused Maxwell of recruiting her to a life of being sexually trafficked while she was a minor.  By late 2009, dozens of Epstein's victims had filed civil lawsuits against him. All suits were settled for undisclosed amounts. In January 2022, unsealed documents revealed that the settlement amount of the 2009 case, entitled Jane Doe No. 102 vs. Jeffrey Epstein, was $500,000 (equivalent to $733,000 in 2024) and other unspecified \"valuable consideration\".\n\n\n=== Decision to speak out publicly ===\n\nGiuffre credited the birth of her daughter on January 7, 2010, as the date she decided to come forward publicly and begin speaking out about her experiences of sexual abuse and trafficking, despite the risks. Vanity Fair stated that Giuffre's story was first publicized in March 2011 by the Mail on Sunday; the coverage included the photo showing Prince Andrew with his arm around her at Maxwell's house in Belgravia, London. FBI agents again made contact with Giuffre, this time at the US consulate in Sydney in 2011, soon after she went public with allegations against Epstein.\nIn December 2014, Giuffre set up the framework for her organization Victims Refuse Silence. It was registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 2015. The objective of Victims Refuse Silence is to \"help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual abuse, and to help others to escape becoming victims of sex trafficking\". For her organization, Giuffre used imagery of a blue Morpho butterfly to symbolize the transformation and empowerment that occurs when a victim becomes a survivor. Blue is the international color of human trafficking awareness. The United States has designated January as Human Trafficking Awareness Month with January 11 listed as National Wear Blue Day. Giuffre's charity was relaunched in November 2021 under the name Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR).\n\n\n=== Prince Andrew allegations and settlement ===\n\nIn a December 2014 Florida court filing, intended for inclusion in the 2008 Crime Victims' Rights Act lawsuit, Giuffre described being trafficked to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, at least three times when she was 17 in 2001 for rape. She claimed that Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell took her to Tramp nightclub in London, where she met and danced with Andrew and that later that night, while en route to Maxwell's Belgravia residence, Maxwell instructed Giuffre to \"do for (Prince Andrew) what you do for Epstein\". She alleged Epstein paid her $15,000 after she had sex with the Duke in London.\nA photo that shows Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Maxwell in Maxwell's apartment has been widely circulated since 2011. Prince Andrew's ten-year role as a United Kingdom trade envoy was terminated in July 2011, and he reportedly cut all ties with Epstein. Maxwell, while serving her prison sentence, stated to several interviewers that she believed the photograph was fake. Following the allegations, The Mail on Sunday, which first published the photograph in 2011, was contacted by the photographer Michael Thomas, who took 39 copies of it, front and back. The back of the photo has a time stamp showing it was developed on March 13, 2001 – three days after Andrew allegedly engaged in sexual activity with Giuffre – and it was printed at a one-hour photo lab at Walgreens in Florida, near Giuffre's former home. \nThe second sexual encounter with Andrew allegedly happened in Epstein's New York mansion. In court documents, Giuffre claimed that the third encounter with Prince Andrew was an orgy on Little Saint James that involved her, several underage girls from Eastern Europe, the Prince, and Epstein himself.\nIn 2015, spokespersons for the British royal family stated that \"any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue\", later repeating the denials. Requests from Giuffre's lawyers for a statement under oath from the Duke about the allegations were returned unanswered.\n\n\n==== Launch of civil lawsuit: Virginia Giuffre v. Prince Andrew (2021) and settlement ====\n\nOn August 9, 2021, Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit in New York against Britain's Prince Andrew alleging that she was forced to have several sexual encounters with the prince in the early 2000s after being trafficked by Epstein when she was 16 and 17 years old. Andrew denied Giuffre's claims. On January 12, 2022, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan rejected Andrew's attempts to dismiss the case, allowing the sexual abuse lawsuit to proceed. \nOn February 15, 2022, the parties reached an out-of-court settlement, which included the Prince making a substantial donation to Giuffre's charity. As part of the settlement, Prince Andrew acknowledged that it is \"known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years\" and that he \"regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others.\" Andrew pledged to \"demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.\" \nThe settlement was an estimated £12 million, part of which went to SOAR (Speak Out, Act, Reclaim), the advocacy charity for survivors of sex trafficking that Giuffre had founded.\n\n\n=== Alan Dershowitz allegations and related lawsuits ===\nGiuffre claims that Epstein sex trafficked her to lawyer and Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz at least six times, the first when she was aged 16. He denied the claims. Dershowitz represented Epstein in his 2008 criminal conviction and helped to negotiate the controversial non-prosecution agreement on his behalf.\nThe claims first appeared in a December 30, 2014, Florida court filing by lawyers Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell which alleged that Dershowitz was one of several prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, to have participated in sexual activities with a minor later identified as Giuffre.  The affidavit from Giuffre was meant for inclusion as part of the 2008 lawsuit (Jane Doe v. USA) accusing the Justice Department of violating the Crime Victims Rights Act during Epstein's first criminal case.  Dershowitz vehemently denied the allegations in Giuffre's statement and sought disbarment of Edwards and Cassell, the lawyers filing the suit.  Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz for defamation in 2015; he countersued.  The two parties settled in 2016 for an undisclosed financial sum.\nFollowing denials by Dershowitz, Giuffre stated, \"I'm not going to be bullied back into silence.\"\nIn 2014, Giuffre was represented by Stanley Pottinger, whose firm specializes in sex abuse cases involving women and children. Anticipating the challenges that awaited Giuffre in accusing extremely wealthy and powerful individuals, Pottinger looked for another lawyer that could match this. At the request of Pottinger, David Boies and his firm Boies Schiller Flexner began representing Giuffre pro bono in 2014. Boies represents several of Epstein's accusers. In addition to Boies, attorneys for Giuffre include Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell.\n\n\n==== Launch of civil lawsuit: Virginia Giuffre v. Alan Dershowitz (2019) ====\nIn April 2019, Giuffre filed a federal civil defamation lawsuit against Alan Dershowitz in New York, with David Boies as her lawyer. \nThat same month, Maria Farmer filed an affidavit in support of Giuffre's defamation suit against Dershowitz which stated that while Farmer worked signing in guests at Epstein's front desk in 1995–1996, she had regularly encountered Dershowitz at the New York mansion at times when underage girls were present.\nIn June, Dershowitz filed a motion to dismiss Giuffre's suit (which was later denied) and a motion to disqualify Boies' firm from representing her (which was later approved). Giuffre stated in September 2019 that she continued to stand by her claims of misconduct by Dershowitz. Dershowitz accused Boies of pressuring Giuffre to provide false testimony, in response to which Boies sued Dershowitz in November 2019 for defamation. \nIn October 2019, Charles Cooper took over representation of Giuffre in the defamation suit against Dershowitz after a judge ruled that Boies could not continue as Giuffre's lawyer because Dershowitz's claim that she conspired with her attorneys to make false claims had turned Boies into a potential witness. Boies filed a separate defamation lawsuit against Dershowitz for implying that he had pressured Giuffre into making false claims.\nAll claims were dismissed on November 8, 2022, after attorneys for Giuffre, Boies, and Dershowitz filed joint stipulations, and no fees were awarded to either side. Giuffre stated she may have been mistaken in identifying Dershowitz.\n\n\n=== Additional civil cases ===\n\n\n==== Virginia Roberts affidavit (2014) ====\nGiuffre filed court papers in Florida in January 2015, stating that Epstein trafficked her to Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz. In a sworn affidavit, she claims Maxwell worked as Epstein's madam. In April 2015, a federal judge ruled that Giuffre could not join the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act lawsuit, and her affidavit was stricken from the case.\n\n\n==== Virginia Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell (2015) ====\nAs a result of Giuffre's allegations and Maxwell's comments about them, Giuffre sued Maxwell for defamation in federal court in New York in September 2015. After much legal confrontation, the case was settled under seal in June 2017 with Maxwell reportedly paying Giuffre \"millions\". On January 8, 2024, the court unsealed documents related to this lawsuit, totaling 4,553 pages and revealing the names of over 150 people connected to Epstein.\n\n\n==== Rina Oh v. Virginia Giuffre (2021) ====\nRina Oh sued Giuffre for defamation in October 2021 in Manhattan federal court, for 20 million in damages. The lawsuit referenced a series of tweets Giuffre made which accused Oh of helping traffic girls for Epstein, while Oh maintained she was a victim who had never helped traffickers. Oh acknowledged that she introduced three young women to Epstein including Marijke Chartouni, and that she had taken Giuffre shopping for a schoolgirl outfit on Epstein's orders. In 2022 in court documents, Oh accused Giuffre of touching her sexually without consent while Epstein watched, but Giuffre denied the claim. Giuffre filed a counterclaim in May 2022 alleging that Oh had cut her during sadomasochistic games done for Epstein.\n\n\n=== Second criminal case against Epstein ===\nJeffrey Epstein was arrested on July 6, 2019, at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy by prosecutors with the Public Corruption Unit of the Southern District of New York In the indictment, Epstein was accused of soliciting massages from underage girls where the activities became increasingly sexual and then of enlisting the girls to recruit other underage victims for pay. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York appealed for other victims of Epstein to come forward. The federal indictment also listed the key role of Epstein's paid \"employees and associates\" responsible for scheduling victims.\nOne month after his arrest, Epstein was found dead on August 10, 2019, after reportedly hanging himself in his Manhattan prison cell.\nOn August 29, 2019, in the wake of Epstein's death 19 days prior, the case against Epstein was closed after District Judge Richard Berman dismissed all sex trafficking charges. Judge Berman expressed support for Epstein's accusers, stating that he invited them to speak publicly at a hearing on August 27, 2019, out of \"respect\" for \"the difficult decisions victims made to come forward\". Giuffre was among the 16 women who spoke publicly at the hearing, which included Anouska De Georgiou, Sarah Ransome, Jennifer Araoz, Chauntae Davies, Courtney Wild, Theresa J. Helm, and Marijke Chartouni. At the hearing, Giuffre stated, \"The reckoning must not end. It must continue. He did not act alone. We the victims know that.\" Prosecutors signaled that they would continue an investigation for potential co-conspirators.\n\n\n== Media coverage and appearances ==\nGiuffre appeared on a special edition of Dateline NBC with Savannah Guthrie discussing the Epstein scandal along with victims Anouska De Georgiou, Rachel Benavidez, Jennifer Araoz, Marijke Chartouni and Chauntae Davies. The special, titled \"Reckoning\", aired on September 20, 2019.\nGiuffre was interviewed for the 60 Minutes Australia investigation that aired on November 10, 2019. In the program she described her experiences of being trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell to have sex with Prince Andrew three times in 2001: the first time being in London at Maxwell's Belgravia residence, the second at Epstein's New York mansion, and the final occurrence (involving multiple girls and the Prince) on Little Saint James.\nGiuffre also gave an interview in October 2019 to the BBC, and described her experience of being sex-trafficked by Epstein to Prince Andrew for a Panorama special, \"The Prince and the Epstein Scandal\", which aired on December 2, 2019. In the program, Giuffre directly appealed to the public by stating, \"I implore the people in the UK to stand up beside me, to help me fight this fight, to not accept this as being ok.\"\nBBC reporter Emily Maitlis conducted a Newsnight interview with Prince Andrew, discussing Giuffre's allegations and his friendship with Epstein, which aired on November 16, 2019. The reaction to the Prince's conduct during the interview was one of overwhelming disapproval; this, combined with Giuffre's public appeal, helped lead to a widespread shift in opinion by the British people. The prince resigned from his royal duties on November 20, 2019, as a number of organizations and charities that he was connected to severed ties. Despite the Prince's promises to assist authorities, in January 2020, U.S. attorney Geoffrey Berman stated that Prince Andrew had provided \"zero cooperation\" after the FBI and the Southern District of New York had requested to interview him as part of the Epstein inquiry.\nIn July 2020, following Maxwell's federal indictment, Giuffre was interviewed by Gayle King for CBS This Morning.\nGiuffre and other survivors of Epstein's sex trafficking ring were featured in the four-part documentary series Surviving Jeffrey Epstein, which premiered on August 9, 2020, on Lifetime.\n\n\n== Manuscript and memoir ==\nGiuffre’s unpublished manuscript The Billionaire’s Playboy Club describes her experiences with Epstein and a man identified as Eppinger. Though never commercially released, the manuscript was filed as evidence during her 2015 lawsuit against Maxwell and became public in 2019 when the court unsealed the document.\nHer second memoir, Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, was co-authored with journalist Amy Wallace beginning in 2021. It is scheduled for posthumous publication by Alfred A. Knopf on 21 October 2025.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFollowing her marriage to Robert Giuffre in 2002, Virginia lived in Glenning Valley on the Central Coast, New South Wales, for 11 years. Together they had three children: two sons and one daughter. The family relocated to the United States in November 2013, initially spending time in Florida, and later in Colorado in 2015. The family moved from the US back to Cairns, Queensland, in 2017. In 2020, she moved with her family to Ocean Reef in Perth, Western Australia. The family purchased a ranch in Neergabby in August 2023 after securing the settlement from Prince Andrew. Virginia and her husband reportedly separated in 2024. Some members of her family said that she had separated from Robert even earlier, in August 2023, when she first raised the subject of divorce. In April 2025, Virginia publicly stated that her husband had physically abused her for many years. Court documents released as part of her litigation with Maxwell indicated that Robert was arrested in Colorado in 2015 and pleaded guilty to domestic violence for which he was placed on probation.\nVirginia said Robert was violent again in January 2025 when the family gathered for a birthday celebration for one of the children. Robert accused Virginia of breaching a family violence restraining order in February and a court hearing was set. For several months afterward, she was prevented from seeing her children. Asked for comment by the press days after her car accident (see below), she denied violating any such order and added that she would defend herself \"against his malicious claim\". At the time of her death, she had been in a custody battle for her three children with Robert, with whom she was undergoing a divorce.\n\n\n== Hospitalization and death ==\nOn March 31, 2025, in an Instagram post, Giuffre said that her car collided with a bus traveling at 110 km/h (70 mph), resulting in her going into renal failure. Giuffre said she had been given four days to live. Her family later said in a statement that \"police were called but said that there was no one available to come to the scene\", and Giuffre, who was \"banged up and bruised\", was subsequently taken to hospital as her condition deteriorated. She was later discharged.\nGiuffre died by suicide at her home in Neergabby, Western Australia, on April 25, 2025, at the age of 41. Her father at first accepted the alleged cause of death as suicide, but on May 1 said he thought that \"somebody got to her\". Giuffre's Australia-based attorney Karrie Louden said she believed that Giuffre's death was not \"suspicious in any way\". At the time, the BBC noted that \"there is still much that is not known about Ms Giuffre's last days or her personal circumstances.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBrown, Julie K.

        "title": "List of presidents of the United States",
        "content": "The president of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States, indirectly elected to a four-year term via the Electoral College. Under the U.S. Constitution, the officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\nThe first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. The incumbent president is Donald Trump, who assumed office on January 20, 2025. Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 47 presidencies. The discrepancy is due to the nonconsecutive terms of Grover Cleveland (counted as the 22nd and 24th president) and Trump (counted as the 45th and 47th president).\nThe presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history. Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.\nFour presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office). John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, setting the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with a new, distinct administration.\nThroughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president who never affiliated with a political party.\n\n\n== Presidents ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nActing President of the United States\nFounding Fathers of the United States\nHistorical rankings of presidents of the United States\nList of vice presidents of the United States\nPresident of the Continental Congress\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to President of the United States at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to List of presidents of the United States at Wikiquote",

        "title": "Facebook",
        "content": "Facebook is an American social media and social networking service owned by the American technology conglomerate Meta. Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. \nSince 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old, except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age requirement is 14 years. As of December 2023, Facebook claimed almost 3.07 billion monthly active users worldwide. As of July 2025, Facebook ranked as the third-most-visited website in the world, with 23% of its traffic coming from the United States. It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.\nFacebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing personal information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their friend or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Messenger, edit messages (within 15 minutes after sending), join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.\nFacebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections) and mass surveillance. The company has also been subject to criticism over its psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech. Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of Facebook traces its growth from a college networking site to a global social networking service.\nWhile attending Phillips Exeter in the early 2000s, Zuckerberg met Kris Tillery. Tillery, a one-time project collaborator with Zuckerberg, would create a school-based social networking project called Photo Address Book. Photo Address Book was a digital face book, created through a linked database composed of student information derived from the official records of the Exeter Student Council. The database contained linkages such as name, dorm-specific landline numbers, and student headshots.\nMark Zuckerberg built a website called \"Facemash\" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used photos from online face books, asking users to choose the 'hotter' person\". Zuckerberg was reported and faced expulsion, but the charges were dropped.\nA \"face book\" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information. In January 2004, Zuckerberg coded a new site known as \"TheFacebook\", stating, \"It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many.\" Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin, and each agreed to invest $1,000. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \"TheFacebook\".\nMembership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College. Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the site. It became available successively to most universities in the US and Canada. In 2004, Napster co-founder Sean Parker became company president and the company moved to Palo Alto, California. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel gave Facebook its first investment. In 2005, the company dropped \"the\" from its name after purchasing the domain name Facebook.com.\nIn 2006, Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address. Facebook introduced key features like the News Feed, which became central to user engagement. By late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted themselves. Facebook had surpassed MySpace in global traffic and became the world's most popular social media platform. Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million ($364 million in 2024 dollars), giving Facebook an implied value of around $15 billion ($22.7 billion in 2024 dollars). Facebook focused on generating revenue through targeted advertising based on user data, a model that drove its rapid financial growth. In 2012, Facebook went public with one of the largest IPOs in tech history. Acquisitions played a significant role in Facebook's dominance. In 2012, it purchased Instagram, followed by WhatsApp and Oculus VR in 2014, extending its influence beyond social networking into messaging and virtual reality. Mark Zuckerberg announces $60 billion investment in Meta AI according to Mashable.\nThe Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018 revealed misuse of user data to influence elections, sparking global outcry and leading to regulatory fines and hearings. Facebook's role in global events, including its use in organizing movements like the Arab Spring and its impact on events like the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, highlighted its dual nature as a tool for both empowerment and harm. In 2021, Facebook rebranded as Meta, reflecting its shift toward building the \"metaverse\" and focusing on virtual reality and augmented reality technologies.\n\n\n== Features ==\nFacebook does not officially publish a maximum character limit for posts; however, User posts can be lengthy, with unofficial sources suggesting a high character limit. Posts may also include images and videos. According to Facebook's official business documentation, videos can be up to 240 minutes long and 10 GB in file size, with supported resolutions up to 1080p.\nUsers can \"friend\" users, both sides must agree to being friends.  Posts can be changed to be seen by everyone (public), friends, people in a certain group (group) or by selected friends (private).  Users can join groups.  Groups are composed of persons with shared interests. For example, they might go to the same sporting club, live in the same suburb, have the same breed of pet or share a hobby.  Posts posted in a group can be seen only by those in a group, unless set to public.\nUsers are able to buy, sell, and swap things on Facebook Marketplace or in a Buy, Swap and Sell group. Facebook users may advertise events, which can be offline, on a website other than Facebook, or on Facebook.\n\n\n== Website ==\n\n\n=== Technical aspects ===\nThe site's primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is red–green colorblind, a realization that occurred after a test taken around 2007. Facebook was initially built using PHP, a popular scripting language designed for web development. PHP was used to create dynamic content and manage data on the server side of the Facebook application. Zuckerberg and co-founders chose PHP for its simplicity and ease of use, which allowed them to quickly develop and deploy the initial version of Facebook. As Facebook grew in user base and functionality, the company encountered scalability and performance challenges with PHP. In response, Facebook engineers developed tools and technologies to optimize PHP performance. One of the most significant was the creation of the HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM). This significantly improved the performance and efficiency of PHP code execution on Facebook's servers.\nThe site upgraded from HTTP to the more secure HTTPS in January 2011.\n\n\n==== 2012 architecture ====\nFacebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Facebook build engineer Chuck Rossi, Facebook compiles into a 1.5 GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom BitTorrent-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime. Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.\nFacebook used a combination platform based on HBase to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as AJAX behavior. These requests are written to a log file using Scribe (developed by Facebook).\nData is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out. Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different data centers (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods. (A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews.) Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a hash table.\nData is then output in PHP format. The backend is written in Java. Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions display pages more quickly. The data is then sent to MapReduce servers where it is queried via Hive. This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive.\n\n\n==== Content delivery network (CDN) ====\nFacebook uses its own content delivery network or \"edge network\" under the domain fbcdn.net for serving static data. Until the mid-2010s, Facebook also relied on Akamai for CDN services.\n\n\n==== Hack programming language ====\n\nOn March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called Hack. Before public release, a large portion of Facebook was already running and \"battle tested\" using the new language.\n\n\n=== User profile/personal timeline ===\n\nEach registered user on Facebook has a personal profile that shows their posts and content. The format of individual user pages was revamped in September 2011 and became known as \"Timeline\", a chronological feed of a user's stories, including status updates, photos, interactions with apps and events. The layout let users add a \"cover photo\". Users were given more privacy settings. In 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Pages for brands and celebrities to interact with their fanbases. In June 2009, Facebook introduced a \"Usernames\" feature, allowing users to choose a unique nickname used in the URL for their personal profile, for easier sharing.\nIn February 2014, Facebook expanded the gender setting, adding a custom input field that allows users to choose from a wide range of gender identities. Users can also set which set of gender-specific pronoun should be used in reference to them throughout the site. In May 2014, Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles. If a user does not provide key information, such as location, hometown, or relationship status, other users can use a new \"ask\" button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click.\n\n\n=== News Feed ===\n\nNews Feed appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events and friends' birthdays. This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users). Zuckerberg apologized for the site's failure to include appropriate privacy features. Users then gained control over what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts and newly added friends.\nOn February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the activity of another user. The sorting and display of stories in a user's News Feed is governed by the EdgeRank algorithm. The Photos application allows users to upload albums and photos. Each album can contain 200 photos. Privacy settings apply to individual albums. Users can \"tag\", or label, friends in a photo. The friend receives a notification about the tag with a link to the photo. This photo tagging feature was developed by Aaron Sittig, now a Design Strategy Lead at Facebook, and former Facebook engineer Scott Marlette back in 2006 and was only granted a patent in 2011.\nOn June 7, 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to help users find games and other applications.\nOn May 13, 2015, Facebook in association with major news portals launched \"Instant Articles\" to provide news on the Facebook news feed without leaving the site. In January 2017, Facebook launched Facebook Stories for iOS and Android in Ireland. The feature, following the format of Snapchat and Instagram stories, allows users to upload photos and videos that appear above friends' and followers' News Feeds and disappear after 24 hours.\nOn October 11, 2017, Facebook introduced the 3D Posts feature to allow for uploading interactive 3D assets. On January 11, 2018, Facebook announced that it would change News Feed to prioritize friends/family content and de-emphasize content from media companies. In February 2020, Facebook announced it would spend $1 billion ($1.21 billion in 2024 dollars) to license news material from publishers for the next three years; a pledge coming as the company falls under scrutiny from governments across the globe over not paying for news content appearing on the platform. The pledge would be in addition to the $600 million ($729 million in 2024 dollars) paid since 2018 through deals with news companies such as The Guardian and Financial Times.\nIn March and April 2021, in response to Apple announcing changes to its iOS device's Identifier for Advertisers policy, which included requiring app developers to directly request to users the ability to track on an opt-in basis, Facebook purchased full-page newspaper advertisements attempting to convince users to allow tracking, highlighting the effects targeted ads have on small businesses. Facebook's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, as Apple released iOS 14.5 in late April 2021, containing the feature for users in what has been deemed \"App Tracking Transparency\". Moreover, statistics from Verizon Communications subsidiary Flurry Analytics show 96% of all iOS users in the United States are not permitting tracking at all, and only 12% of worldwide iOS users are allowing tracking, which some news outlets deem \"Facebook's nightmare\", among similar terms. Despite the news, Facebook stated that the new policy and software update would be \"manageable\".\n\n\n=== Like button ===\n\nThe \"like\" button, stylized as a \"thumbs up\" icon, was first enabled on February 9, 2009, and enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos and videos, links shared by friends, and advertisements. Once clicked by a user, the designated content is more likely to appear in friends' News Feeds. The button displays the number of other users who have liked the content. The like button was extended to comments in June 2010. In February 2016, Facebook expanded Like into \"Reactions\", allowing users to choose from five pre-defined emotions: \"Love\", \"Haha\", \"Wow\", \"Sad\", or \"Angry\". In late April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a new \"Care\" reaction was added.\n\n\n=== Instant messaging ===\n\nFacebook Messenger is an instant messaging service and software application. It began as Facebook Chat in 2008, was revamped in 2010 and eventually became a standalone mobile app in August 2011, while remaining part of the user page on browsers. Complementing regular conversations, Messenger lets users make one-to-one and group voice and video calls. Its Android app has integrated support for SMS and \"Chat Heads\", which are round profile photo icons appearing on-screen regardless of what app is open, while both apps support multiple accounts, conversations with optional end-to-end encryption and \"Instant Games\". Some features, including sending money and requesting transportation, are limited to the United States. In 2017, Facebook added \"Messenger Day\", a feature that lets users share photos and videos in a story-format with all their friends with the content disappearing after 24 hours; Reactions, which lets users tap and hold a message to add a reaction through an emoji; and Mentions, which lets users in group conversations type @ to give a particular user a notification.\nIn April 2020, Facebook began rolling out a new feature called Messenger Rooms, a video chat feature that allows users to chat with up to 50 people at a time. In July 2020, Facebook added a new feature in Messenger that lets iOS users to use Face ID or Touch ID to lock their chats. The feature is called App Lock and is a part of several changes in Messenger regarding privacy and security. On October 13, 2020, the Messenger application introduced cross-app messaging with Instagram, which was launched in September 2021. In addition to the integrated messaging, the application announced the introduction of a new logo, which will be an amalgamation of the Messenger and Instagram logo.\nBusinesses and users can interact through Messenger with features such as tracking purchases and receiving notifications, and interacting with customer service representatives. Third-party developers can integrate apps into Messenger, letting users enter an app while inside Messenger and optionally share details from the app into a chat. Developers can build chatbots into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to distribute news. Businesses like respond.io, Twilio, and Manychat also used the APIs to develop chatbots and automation platforms for commercial use.\nThe M virtual assistant (U.S.) scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money. Group chatbots appear in Messenger as \"Chat Extensions\". A \"Discovery\" tab allows finding bots, and enabling special, branded QR codes that, when scanned, take the user to a specific bot.\n\n\n=== Privacy policy ===\n\nFacebook's data policy outlines its policies for collecting, storing, and sharing user's data. Facebook enables users to control access to individual posts and their profile through privacy settings. The user's name and profile picture (if applicable) are public.\nFacebook's revenue depends on targeted advertising, which involves analyzing user data to decide which ads to show each user. Facebook buys data from third parties, gathered from both online and offline sources, to supplement its own data on users. Facebook maintains that it does not share data used for targeted advertising with the advertisers themselves. The company states:\n\n\"We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.\"\nAs of October 2021, Facebook claims it uses the following policy for sharing user data with third parties:\n\nApps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.\nWhen you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.\nDevices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.\n\nNote: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.\nFacebook will also share data with law enforcement if needed to.\nFacebook's policies have changed repeatedly since the service's debut, amid a series of controversies covering everything from how well it secures user data, to what extent it allows users to control access, to the kinds of access given to third parties, including businesses, political campaigns and governments. These facilities vary according to country, as some nations require the company to make data available (and limit access to services), while the European Union's GDPR regulation mandates additional privacy protections.\n\n\n=== Bug Bounty Program ===\n\nOn July 29, 2011, Facebook announced its Bug Bounty Program that paid security researchers a minimum of $500 ($699.00 in 2024 dollars) for reporting security holes. The company promised not to pursue \"white hat\" hackers who identified such problems. This led researchers in many countries to participate, particularly in India and Russia.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Userbase ===\nFacebook's rapid growth began as soon as it became available and continued through 2018, before beginning to decline. Facebook passed 100 million registered users in 2008, and 500 million in July 2010. According to the company's data at the July 2010 announcement, half of the site's membership used Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150 million users accessed the site by mobile.\nIn October 2012, Facebook's monthly active users passed one billion, with 600 million mobile users, 219 billion photo uploads, and 140 billion friend connections. The 2 billion user mark was crossed in June 2017. In November 2015, after skepticism about the accuracy of its \"monthly active users\" measurement, Facebook changed its definition to a logged-in member who visits the Facebook site through the web browser or mobile app, or uses the Facebook Messenger app, in the 30-day period prior to the measurement. This excluded the use of third-party services with Facebook integration, which was previously counted.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the percentage of the U.S. population over the age of 12 who use Facebook has declined, from 67% to 61% (a decline of some 15 million U.S. users), with a higher drop-off among younger Americans (a decrease in the percentage of U.S. 12- to 34-year-olds who are users from 58% in 2015 to 29% in 2019). The decline coincided with an increase in the popularity of Instagram, which is also owned by Meta. The number of daily active users experienced a quarterly decline for the first time in the last quarter of 2021, down to 1.929 billion from 1.930 billion, but increased again the next quarter despite being banned in Russia.\nHistorically, commentators have offered predictions of Facebook's decline or end, based on causes such as a declining user base; the legal difficulties of being a closed platform, inability to generate revenue, inability to offer user privacy, inability to adapt to mobile platforms, or Facebook ending itself to present a next generation replacement; or Facebook's role in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nThe highest number of Facebook users as of April 2023 are from India and the United States, followed by Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. Region-wise, the highest number of users in 2018 are from Asia-Pacific (947 million) followed by Europe (381 million) and US-Canada (242 million). The rest of the world has 750 million users.\nOver the 2008–2018 period, the percentage of users under 34 declined to less than half of the total.\n\n\n=== Censorship ===\n\nIn many countries the social networking sites and mobile apps have been blocked temporarily, intermittently, or permanently, including: Brazil, China, Iran, Vietnam, Pakistan, Syria, and North Korea. In May 2018, the government of Papua New Guinea announced that it would ban Facebook for a month while it considered the impact of the website on the country, though no ban has since occurred. In 2019, Facebook announced it would start enforcing its ban on users, including influencers, promoting any vape, tobacco products, or weapons on its platforms.\n\n\n== Criticisms and controversies ==\n\nFacebook's importance and scale has led to criticisms in many domains. Issues include Internet privacy, excessive retention of user information, its facial recognition software, DeepFace its addictive quality and its role in the workplace, including employer access to employee accounts.\nFacebook has been criticized for electricity usage, tax avoidance, real-name user requirement policies, censorship and its involvement in the United States PRISM surveillance program. According to The Express Tribune, Facebook \"avoided billions of dollars in tax using offshore companies\".\nFacebook is alleged to have harmful psychological effects on its users, including feelings of jealousy and stress, a lack of attention and social media addiction. According to Kaufmann et al., mothers' motivations for using social media are often related to their social and mental health. European antitrust regulator Margrethe Vestager stated that Facebook's terms of service relating to private data were \"unbalanced\".\nFacebook has been criticized for allowing users to publish illegal or offensive material. Specifics include copyright and intellectual property infringement, hate speech, incitement of rape and terrorism, fake news, and crimes, murders, and livestreaming violent incidents. Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content. Sri Lanka blocked both Facebook and WhatsApp in May 2019 after anti-Muslim riots, the worst in the country since the Easter Sunday bombing in the same year as a temporary measure to maintain peace in Sri Lanka.\nFacebook removed 3 billion fake accounts only during the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019; in comparison, the social network reports 2.39 billion monthly active users.\nIn late July 2019, the company announced it was under antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe consumer advocacy group Which? claimed individuals were still utilizing Facebook to set up fraudulent five-star ratings for products. The group identified 14 communities that exchange reviews for either money or complimentary items such as watches, earbuds, and sprinklers.\n\n\n=== Privacy concerns ===\n\nFacebook has experienced a steady stream of controversies over how it handles user privacy, repeatedly adjusting its privacy settings and policies. Since 2009, Facebook has been participating in the PRISM secret program, sharing with the US National Security Agency audio, video, photographs, e-mails, documents and connection logs from user profiles, among other social media services.\nOn November 29, 2011, Facebook settled Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises. In August 2013 High-Tech Bridge published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook. In January 2014 two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice.\nOn June 7, 2018, Facebook announced that a bug had resulted in about 14 million Facebook users having their default sharing setting for all new posts set to \"public\". Its data-sharing agreement with Chinese companies such as Huawei came under the scrutiny of US lawmakers, although the information accessed was not stored on Huawei servers and remained on users' phones. On April 4, 2019, half a billion records of Facebook users were found exposed on Amazon cloud servers, containing information about users' friends, likes, groups, and checked-in locations, as well as names, passwords and email addresses.\nThe phone numbers of at least 200 million Facebook users were found to be exposed on an open online database in September 2019. They included 133 million US users, 18 million from the UK, and 50 million from users in Vietnam. After removing duplicates, the 419 million records have been reduced to 219 million. The database went offline after TechCrunch contacted the web host. It is thought the records were amassed using a tool that Facebook disabled in April 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica controversy. A Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement: \"The dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year...There is no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised.\"\nFacebook's privacy problems resulted in companies like Viber Media and Mozilla discontinuing advertising on Facebook's platforms. A January 2024 study by Consumer Reports found that among a self-selected group of volunteer participants, each user is monitored or tracked by over two thousand companies on average. LiveRamp, a San Francisco-based data broker, is responsible for 96 per cent of the data. Other companies such as Home Depot, Macy's, and Walmart are involved as well.\nIn March 2024, a court in California released documents detailing Facebook's 2016 \"Project Ghostbusters\". The project was aimed at helping Facebook compete with Snapchat and involved Facebook trying to develop decryption tools to collect, decrypt, and analyze traffic that users generated when visiting Snapchat and, eventually, YouTube and Amazon. The company eventually used its tool Onavo to initiate man-in-the-middle attacks and read users' traffic before it was encrypted.\n\n\n==== Racial bias ====\nFacebook was accused of committing \"systemic\" racial bias by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission based on the complaints of three rejected candidates and a current employee of the company. The three rejected employees along with the Operational Manager at Facebook as of March 2021 accused the firm of discriminating against Black people. The EEOC initiated an investigation into the case in March 2021.\n\n\n==== Shadow profiles ====\nA \"shadow profile\" refers to the data Facebook collects about individuals without their explicit permission. For example, the \"like\" button that appears on third-party websites allows the company to collect information about an individual's internet browsing habits, even if the individual is not a Facebook user. Data can also be collected by other users. For example, a Facebook user can link their email account to their Facebook to find friends on the site, allowing the company to collect the email addresses of users and non-users alike. Over time, countless data points about an individual are collected; any single data point perhaps cannot identify an individual, but together allows the company to form a unique \"profile\".\nThis practice has been criticized by those who believe people should be able to opt-out of involuntary data collection. Additionally, while Facebook users have the ability to download and inspect the data they provide to the site, data from the user's \"shadow profile\" is not included, and non-users of Facebook do not have access to this tool regardless. The company has also been unclear whether or not it is possible for a person to revoke Facebook's access to their \"shadow profile\".\n\n\n==== Cambridge Analytica ====\n\nFacebook customer Global Science Research sold information on over 87 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica, a political data analysis firm led by Alexander Nix. While approximately 270,000 people used the app, Facebook's API permitted data collection from their friends without their knowledge. At first Facebook downplayed the significance of the breach, and suggested that Cambridge Analytica no longer had access. Facebook then issued a statement expressing alarm and suspended Cambridge Analytica. Review of documents and interviews with former Facebook employees suggested that Cambridge Analytica still possessed the data. This was a violation of Facebook's consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. This violation potentially carried a penalty of $40,000 ($50,087 in 2024 dollars) per occurrence, totalling trillions of dollars.\nAccording to The Guardian, both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story. After publication, Facebook claimed that it had been \"lied to\". On March 23, 2018, the English High Court granted an application by the Information Commissioner's Office for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's London offices, ending a standoff between Facebook and the Information Commissioner over responsibility.\nOn March 25, Facebook published a statement by Zuckerberg in major UK and US newspapers apologizing over a \"breach of trust\".\n\nYou may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014. This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nWe've already stopped apps like this from getting so much information. Now we're limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook.\nWe're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\nFinally, we'll remind you which apps you've given access to your information – so you can shut off the ones you don't want anymore.\n\nThank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.\nOn March 26, the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into the matter. The controversy led Facebook to end its partnerships with data brokers who aid advertisers in targeting users.\nOn April 24, 2019, Facebook said it could face a fine between $3 billion ($3.69 billion in 2024 dollars) to $5 billion ($6.15 billion in 2024 dollars) as the result of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. On July 24, 2019, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion, the largest penalty ever imposed on a company for violating consumer privacy. Additionally, Facebook had to implement a new privacy structure, follow a 20-year settlement order, and allow the FTC to monitor Facebook. Cambridge Analytica's CEO and a developer faced restrictions on future business dealings and were ordered to destroy any personal information they collected. Cambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy. Facebook also implemented additional privacy controls and settings in part to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in May. Facebook also ended its active opposition to the California Consumer Privacy Act.\nSome, such as Meghan McCain, have drawn an equivalence between the use of data by Cambridge Analytica and the Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, which, according to Investor's Business Daily, \"encouraged supporters to download an Obama 2012 Facebook app that, when activated, let the campaign collect Facebook data both on users and their friends.\" Carol Davidsen, the Obama for America (OFA) former director of integration and media analytics, wrote that \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn't stop us once they realised that was what we were doing\". PolitiFact has rated McCain's statements \"Half-True\", on the basis that \"in Obama's case, direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign\" whereas with Cambridge Analytica, users thought they were only taking a personality quiz for academic purposes, and while the Obama campaign only used the data \"to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends\", Cambridge Analytica \"targeted users, friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads.\"\n\n\n==== DataSpii ====\nIn July 2019, cybersecurity researcher Sam Jadali exposed a catastrophic data leak known as DataSpii involving data provider DDMR and marketing intelligence company Nacho Analytics (NA). Branding itself as the \"God mode for the internet\", NA through DDMR, provided its members access to private Facebook photos and Facebook Messenger attachments including tax returns. DataSpii harvested data from millions of Chrome and Firefox users through compromised browser extensions. The NA website stated it collected data from millions of opt-in users. Jadali, along with journalists from Ars Technica and The Washington Post, interviewed impacted users, including a Washington Post staff member. According to the interviews, the impacted users did not consent to such collection.\nDataSpii demonstrated how a compromised user exposed the data of others, including the private photos and Messenger attachments belonging to a Facebook user's network of friends.\nDataSpii exploited Facebook's practice of making private photos and Messenger attachments publicly accessible via unique URLs. To bolster security in this regard, Facebook appends query strings in the URLs so as to limit the period of accessibility. Nevertheless, NA provided real-time access to these unique URLs, which were intended to be secure. This allowed NA members to access the private content within the restricted time frame designated by Facebook.\nThe Washington Post's Geoffrey Fowler, in collaboration with Jadali, opened Fowler's private Facebook photo in a browser with a compromised browser extension. Within minutes, they anonymously retrieved the \"private\" photo. To validate this proof-of-concept, they searched for Fowler's name using NA, which yielded his photo as a search result. In addition, Jadali discovered Fowler's Washington Post colleague, Nick Mourtoupalas, was directly impacted by DataSpii. Jadali's investigation elucidated how DataSpii disseminated private data to additional third-parties, including foreign entities, within minutes of the data being acquired. In doing so, he identified the third-parties who were scraping, storing, and potentially enabling the facial-recognition of individuals in photos being furnished by DataSpii.\n\n\n==== Breaches ====\nOn September 28, 2018, Facebook experienced a major breach in its security, exposing the data of 50 million users. The data breach started in July 2017 and was discovered on September 16. Facebook notified users affected by the exploit and logged them out of their accounts. In March 2019, Facebook confirmed a password compromise of millions of Facebook lite application users also affected millions of Instagram users. The reason cited was the storage of password as plain text instead of encryption which could be read by its employees.\nOn December 19, 2019, security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered a database containing more than 267 million Facebook user IDs, phone numbers, and names that were left exposed on the web for anyone to access without a password or any other authentication. In February 2020, Facebook encountered a major security breach in which its official Twitter account was hacked by a Saudi Arabia-based group called \"OurMine\". The group has a history of actively exposing high-profile social media profiles' vulnerabilities.\nIn April 2021, The Guardian reported approximately half a billion users' data had been stolen including birthdates and phone numbers. Facebook alleged it was \"old data\" from a problem fixed in August 2019 despite the data's having been released a year and a half later only in 2021; it declined to speak with journalists, had apparently not notified regulators, called the problem \"unfixable\", and said it would not be advising users. In September 2024, Meta paid a $101 million fine for storing up to 600 million passwords of Facebook and Instagram users in plain text. The practice was initially discovered in 2019, though reports indicate passwords were stored in plain text since 2012.\n\n\n==== Phone data and activity ====\n\nAfter acquiring Onavo in 2013, Facebook used its Onavo Protect virtual private network (VPN) app to collect information on users' web traffic and app usage. This allowed Facebook to monitor its competitors' performance, and motivated Facebook to acquire WhatsApp in 2014. Media outlets classified Onavo Protect as spyware. In August 2018, Facebook removed the app in response to pressure from Apple, who asserted that it violated their guidelines. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sued Facebook on December 16, 2020, for \"false, misleading or deceptive conduct\" in response to the company's unauthorized use of personal data obtained from Onavo for business purposes in contrast to Onavo's privacy-oriented marketing.\nIn 2016, Facebook Research launched Project Atlas, offering some users between the ages of 13 and 35 up to $20 per month ($26.00 in 2024 dollars) in exchange for their personal data, including their app usage, web browsing history, web search history, location history, personal messages, photos, videos, emails and Amazon order history. In January 2019, TechCrunch reported on the project. This led Apple to temporarily revoke Facebook's Enterprise Developer Program certificates for one day, preventing Facebook Research from operating on iOS devices and disabling Facebook's internal iOS apps.\nArs Technica reported in April 2018 that the Facebook Android app had been harvesting user data, including phone calls and text messages, since 2015. In May 2018, several Android users filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook for invading their privacy. In January 2020, Facebook launched the Off-Facebook Activity page, which allows users to see information collected by Facebook about their non-Facebook activities. The Washington Post columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler found that this included what other apps he used on his phone, even while the Facebook app was closed, what other web sites he visited on his phone, and what in-store purchases he made from affiliated businesses, even while his phone was completely off.\nIn November 2021, a report was published by Fairplay, Global Action Plan and Reset Australia detailing accusations that Facebook was continuing to manage their ad targeting system with data collected from teen users. The accusations follow announcements by Facebook in July 2021 that they would cease ad targeting children.\n\n\n==== Public apologies ====\nThe company first apologized for its privacy abuses in 2009.\nFacebook apologies have appeared in newspapers, television, blog posts and on Facebook. On March 25, 2018, leading US and UK newspapers published full-page ads with a personal apology from Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg issued a verbal apology on CNN. In May 2010, he apologized for discrepancies in privacy settings.\nPreviously, Facebook had its privacy settings spread out over 20 pages, and has now put all of its privacy settings on one page, which makes it more difficult for third-party apps to access the user's personal information. In addition to publicly apologizing, Facebook has said that it will be reviewing and auditing thousands of apps that display \"suspicious activities\" in an effort to ensure that this breach of privacy does not happen again. In a 2010 report regarding privacy, a research project stated that not a lot of information is available regarding the consequences of what people disclose online so often what is available are just reports made available through popular media. In 2017, a former Facebook executive went on the record to discuss how social media platforms have contributed to the unraveling of the \"fabric of society\".\n\n\n=== Content disputes and moderation ===\n\nFacebook relies on its users to generate the content that bonds its users to the service. The company has come under criticism both for allowing objectionable content, including conspiracy theories and fringe discourse, and for prohibiting other content that it deems inappropriate.\n\n\n==== Misinformation and fake news ====\n\nFacebook has been criticized as a vector for fake news, and has been accused of bearing responsibility for the conspiracy theory that the United States created ISIS, false anti-Rohingya posts being used by Myanmar's military to fuel genocide and ethnic cleansing, enabling climate change denial and Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theorists, and anti-refugee attacks in Germany. The government of the Philippines has also used Facebook as a tool to attack its critics.\nIn 2017, Facebook partnered with fact checkers from the Poynter Institute's international fact-checking network to identify and mark false content, though most ads from political candidates are exempt from this program. As of 2018, Facebook had over 40 fact-checking partners across the world, including The Weekly Standard. Critics of the program have accused Facebook of not doing enough to remove false information from its website.\nFacebook has repeatedly amended its content policies. In July 2018, it stated that it would \"downrank\" articles that its fact-checkers determined to be false, and remove misinformation that incited violence. Facebook stated that content that receives \"false\" ratings from its fact-checkers can be demonetized and suffer dramatically reduced distribution. Specific posts and videos that violate community standards can be removed on Facebook. In May 2019, Facebook banned a number of \"dangerous\" commentators from its platform, including Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Paul Nehlen, David Duke, and Laura Loomer, for allegedly engaging in \"violence and hate\".\nIn May 2020, Facebook agreed to a preliminary settlement of $52 million ($63.2 million in 2024 dollars) to compensate U.S.-based Facebook content moderators for their psychological trauma suffered on the job. Other legal actions around the world, including in Ireland, await settlement. In September 2020, the Government of Thailand utilized the Computer Crime Act for the first time to take action against Facebook and Twitter for ignoring requests to take down content and not complying with court orders.\nAccording to a report by Reuters, beginning in 2020, the United States military ran a propaganda campaign to spread disinformation about the Sinovac Chinese COVID-19 vaccine, including using fake social media accounts to spread the disinformation that the Sinovac vaccine contained pork-derived ingredients and was therefore haram under Islamic law. The campaign was described as \"payback\" for COVID-19 disinformation by China directed against the U.S. In summer 2020, Facebook asked the military to remove the accounts, stating that they violated Facebook's policies on fake accounts and on COVID-19 information. The campaign continued until mid-2021.\n\n\n==== Threats and incitement ====\nProfessor Ilya Somin reported that he had been the subject of death threats on Facebook in April 2018 from Cesar Sayoc, who threatened to kill Somin and his family and \"feed the bodies to Florida alligators\". Somin's Facebook friends reported the comments to Facebook, which did nothing except dispatch automated messages. Sayoc was later arrested for the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts directed at Democratic politicians.\n\n\n==== Terrorism ====\nForce v. Facebook, Inc., 934 F.3d 53 (2nd Cir. 2019) was a case that alleged Facebook was profiting off recommendations for Hamas. In 2019, the US Second Circuit Appeals Court held that Section 230 bars civil terrorism claims against social media companies and internet service providers, the first federal appellate court to do so.\n\n\n==== Hate speech ====\nIn October 2020, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan urged Mark Zuckerberg, through a letter posted on government's Twitter account, to ban Islamophobic content on Facebook, warning that it encouraged extremism and violence. In October 2020, the company announced that it would ban Holocaust denial.\nIn October 2022, Media Matters for America published a report that Facebook and Instagram were still profiting off advertisements using the slur \"groomer\" for LGBT people. The article reported that Meta had previously confirmed that the use of this word for the LGBT community violates its hate speech policies. The story was subsequently picked up by other news outlets such as the New York Daily News, PinkNews, and LGBTQ Nation.\n\n\n==== Violent erotica ====\nThere are ads on Facebook and Instagram containing sexually explicit content, descriptions of graphic violence and content promoting acts of self harm. Many of the ads are for webnovel apps backed by tech giants Bytedance and Tencent.\n\n\n==== InfoWars ====\nFacebook was criticized for allowing InfoWars to publish falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Facebook defended its actions in regard to InfoWars, saying \"we just don't think banning Pages for sharing conspiracy theories or false news is the right way to go.\" Facebook provided only six cases in which it fact-checked content on the InfoWars page over the period September 2017 to July 2018. In 2018, InfoWars falsely claimed that the survivors of the Parkland shooting were \"actors\". Facebook pledged to remove InfoWars content making the claim, although InfoWars videos pushing the false claims were left up, even though Facebook had been contacted about the videos. Facebook stated that the videos never explicitly called them actors. Facebook also allowed InfoWars videos that shared the Pizzagate conspiracy theory to survive, despite specific assertions that it would purge Pizzagate content. In late July 2018, Facebook suspended the personal profile of InfoWars head Alex Jones for 30 days. In early August 2018, Facebook banned the four most active InfoWars-related pages for hate speech.\n\n\n=== Political manipulation ===\n\nAs a dominant social-web service with massive outreach, Facebook has been used by identified or unidentified political operatives to affect public opinion. Some of these activities have been done in violation of the platform policies, creating \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\", support or attacks. These activities can be scripted or paid. Various such abusive campaign have been revealed in recent years, best known being the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2021, former Facebook analyst within the Spam and Fake Engagement teams, Sophie Zhang, reported more than 25 political subversion operations and criticized the general slow reaction time, oversightless, laissez-faire attitude by Facebook.\n\n\n==== Influence Operations and Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior ====\nIn 2018, Facebook said that during 2018 they had identified \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" in \"many Pages, Groups and accounts created to stir up political debate, including in the US, the Middle East, Russia and the UK.\"\nCampaigns operated by the British intelligence agency unit, called Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group, have broadly fallen into two categories; cyber attacks and propaganda efforts. The propaganda efforts utilize \"mass messaging\" and the \"pushing [of] stories\" via social media sites like Facebook. Israel's Jewish Internet Defense Force, the Chinese Communist Party's 50 Cent Party and Turkey's AK Trolls also focus their attention on social media platforms like Facebook. In July 2018, Samantha Bradshaw, co-author of the report from the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) at Oxford University, said that \"The number of countries where formally organised social media manipulation occurs has greatly increased, from 28 to 48 countries globally. The majority of growth comes from political parties who spread disinformation and junk news around election periods.\" In October 2018, The Daily Telegraph reported that Facebook \"banned hundreds of pages and accounts that it says were fraudulently flooding its site with partisan political content – although they came from the United States instead of being associated with Russia.\"\nIn December 2018, The Washington Post reported that \"Facebook has suspended the account of Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of a top social media research firm\" New Knowledge, \"after reports that he and others engaged in an operation to spread disinformation\" on Facebook and Twitter during the 2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama. In January 2019, Facebook said it has removed 783 Iran-linked accounts, pages and groups for engaging in what it called \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\". In March 2019, Facebook sued four Chinese firms for selling \"fake accounts, likes and followers\" to amplify Chinese state media outlets.\nIn May 2019, Tel Aviv-based private intelligence agency Archimedes Group was banned from Facebook for \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" after Facebook found fake users in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Facebook investigations revealed that Archimedes had spent some $1.1 million ($1.35 million in 2024 dollars) on fake ads, paid for in Brazilian reais, Israeli shekels and US dollars. Facebook gave examples of Archimedes Group political interference in Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Angola, Niger and Tunisia. The Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab said in a report that \"The tactics employed by Archimedes Group, a private company, closely resemble the types of information warfare tactics often used by governments, and the Kremlin in particular.\"\nOn May 23, 2019, Facebook released its Community Standards Enforcement Report highlighting that it has identified several fake accounts through artificial intelligence and human monitoring. In a period of six months, October 2018 – March 2019, the social media website removed a total of 3.39 billion fake accounts. The number of fake accounts was reported to be more than 2.4 billion real people on the platform.\nIn July 2019, Facebook advanced its measures to counter deceptive political propaganda and other abuse of its services. The company removed more than 1,800 accounts and pages that were being operated from Russia, Thailand, Ukraine and Honduras. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it was announced that the internet regulatory committee would block access to Facebook. On October 30, 2019, Facebook deleted several accounts of the employees working at the Israeli NSO Group, stating that the accounts were \"deleted for not following our terms\". The deletions came after WhatsApp sued the Israeli surveillance firm for targeting 1,400 devices with spyware.\n\nIn 2020, Facebook helped found American Edge, an anti-regulation lobbying firm to fight anti-trust probes. The group runs ads that \"fail to mention what legislation concerns them, how those concerns could be fixed, or how the horrors they warn of could actually happen\", and do not clearly disclose that they are funded by Facebook.\nIn 2020, the government of Thailand forced Facebook to take down a Facebook group called Royalist Marketplace with one million members following potentially illegal posts shared. The authorities have also threatened Facebook with legal action. In response, Facebook is planning to take legal action against the Thai government for suppression of freedom of expression and violation of human rights. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook found that troll farms from North Macedonia and the Philippines pushed coronavirus disinformation. The publisher, which used content from these farms, was banned.\nIn the run-up to the 2020 United States elections, Eastern European troll farms operated popular Facebook pages showing content related to Christians and Blacks in America. They included more than 15,000 pages combined and were viewed by 140 million US users per month. This was in part due to how Facebook's algorithm and policies allow unoriginal viral content to be copied and spread in ways that still drive up user engagement. As of September 2021, some of the most popular pages were still active on Facebook despite the company's efforts to take down such content.\nIn February 2021, Facebook removed the main page of the Myanmar military, after two protesters were shot and killed during the anti-coup protests. Facebook said that the page breached its guidelines that prohibit the incitement of violence. On February 25, Facebook announced to ban all accounts of the Myanmar military, along with the \"Tatmadaw-linked commercial entities\". Citing the \"exceptionally severe human rights abuses and the clear risk of future military-initiated violence in Myanmar\", the tech giant also implemented the move on its subsidiary, Instagram. In March 2021, The Wall Street Journal's editorial board criticized Facebook's decision to fact-check its op-ed titled \"We'll Have Herd immunity by April\" written by surgeon Marty Makary, calling it \"counter-opinion masquerading as fact checking.\"\nFacebook guidelines allow users to call for the death of public figures, they also allow praise of mass killers and 'violent non-state actors' in some situations. In 2021, former Facebook analyst within the Spam and Fake Engagement teams, Sophie Zhang, reported on more than 25 political subversion operations she uncovered while in Facebook, and the general laissez-faire by the private enterprise.\nIn 2021, Facebook was cited as playing a role in the fomenting of the 2021 United States Capitol attack.\n\n\n==== Russian interference ====\n\nIn 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian organizations for \"engaging in operations to interfere with U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 presidential election.\"\nMueller contacted Facebook subsequently to the company's disclosure that it had sold more than $100,000 ($131,018 in 2024 dollars) worth of ads to a company (Internet Research Agency, owned by Russian billionaire and businessman Yevgeniy Prigozhin) with links to the Russian intelligence community before the 2016 United States presidential election. In September 2017, Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote the company \"found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June 2015 to May 2017 – associated with roughly 3,000 ads – that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia.\" Clinton and Trump campaigns spent $81 million ($106 million in 2024 dollars) on Facebook ads.\nThe company pledged full cooperation in Mueller's investigation, and provided all information about the Russian advertisements. Members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have claimed that Facebook had withheld information that could illuminate the Russian propaganda campaign. Russian operatives have used Facebook polarize the American public discourses, organizing both Black Lives Matter rallies and anti-immigrant rallies on U.S. soil, as well as anti-Clinton rallies and rallies both for and against Donald Trump. Facebook ads have also been used to exploit divisions over black political activism and Muslims by simultaneously sending contrary messages to different users based on their political and demographic characteristics in order to sow discord. Zuckerberg has stated that he regrets having dismissed concerns over Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nRussian-American billionaire Yuri Milner, who befriended Zuckerberg between 2009 and 2011, had Kremlin backing for his investments in Facebook and Twitter. In January 2019, Facebook removed 289 pages and 75 coordinated accounts linked to the Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik which had misrepresented themselves as independent news or general interest pages. Facebook later identified and removed an additional 1,907 accounts linked to Russia found to be engaging in \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\". In 2018, a UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee report had criticized Facebook for its reluctance to investigate abuse of its platform by the Russian government, and for downplaying the extent of the problem, referring to the company as 'digital gangsters'.\"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day,\" Damian Collins, DCMS Committee ChairIn February 2019, Glenn Greenwald wrote that a cybersecurity company New Knowledge, which is behind one of the Senate reports on Russian social media election interference, \"was caught just six weeks ago engaging in a massive scam to create fictitious Russian troll accounts on Facebook and Twitter in order to claim that the Kremlin was working to defeat Democratic Senate nominee Doug Jones in Alabama. The New York Times, when exposing the scam, quoted a New Knowledge report that boasted of its fabrications...\"\n\n\n==== Anti-Rohingya propaganda ====\n\nIn 2018, Facebook took down 536 Facebook pages, 17 Facebook groups, 175 Facebook accounts, and 16 Instagram accounts linked to the Myanmar military. Collectively these were followed by over 10 million people. The New York Times reported that:\n\nafter months of reports about anti-Rohingya propaganda on Facebook, the company acknowledged that it had been too slow to act in Myanmar. By then, more than 700,000 Rohingya had fled the country in a year, in what United Nations officials called \"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing\".\n\n\n==== Anti-Muslim propaganda and Hindu nationalism in India ====\nA 2019 book titled The Real Face of Facebook in India, co-authored by the journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta and Cyril Sam, alleged that Facebook helped enable and benefited from the rise of Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. Ankhi Das, Facebook's policy director for India and South and Central Asia, apologized publicly in August 2020 for sharing a Facebook post which called Muslims in India a \"degenerate community\". She said she shared the post \"to reflect my deep belief in celebrating feminism and civic participation\". She is reported to have prevented action by Facebook against anti-Muslim content and supported the BJP in internal Facebook messages.\nIn 2020, Facebook executives overrode their employees' recommendations that the BJP politician T. Raja Singh should be banned from the site for hate speech and rhetoric that could lead to violence. Singh had said on Facebook that Rohingya Muslim immigrants should be shot and had threatened to destroy mosques. Current and former Facebook employees told The Wall Street Journal that the decision was part of a pattern of favoritism by Facebook toward the BJP as it seeks more business in India. Facebook also took no action after BJP politicians made posts accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading COVID-19, an employee said.\nIn 2020, the Delhi Assembly began investigating whether Facebook bore blame for the 2020 religious riots in the city, claiming it had found Facebook \"prima facie guilty of a role in the violence\". Following a summons by a Delhi Assembly Committee, Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit Mohan moved the Supreme Court, which granted him relief and ordered a stay to the summons. The Central government later backed the decision, and submitted in the court that Facebook could not be made accountable before any state assembly and the committee formed was unconstitutional. Following a fresh notice by the Delhi Assembly panel in 2021 for failing to appear before it as a witness, Mohan challenged it saying that the 'right to silence' is a virtue in present 'noisy times' and the legislature had no authority to examine him in a law and order case. In July 2021, the Supreme Court refused to quash the summons and asked Facebook to appear before the Delhi assembly panel.\nOn September 23, 2023, it was reported that Facebook had delayed for about a year when in 2021, it removed a network of accounts ran by India's Chinar Corps which spread disinformation that would put Kashmiri journalists in danger. The delay and the previously not publicized takedown action were due a fear that its local employees would be targeted by authorities, and that it would hurt business prospects in the country.\n\n\n=== Company governance ===\nEarly Facebook investor and former Zuckerberg mentor Roger McNamee described Facebook as having \"the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company.\" Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued in 2018 for transforming Facebook into a platform cooperative owned and governed by the users.\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes stated in 2019 that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into multiple smaller companies. He called for the breakup of Facebook in an op-ed in The New York Times. Hughes says he is concerned that Zuckerberg has surrounded himself with a team that does not challenge him and that as a result, it is the U.S. government's job to hold him accountable and curb his \"unchecked power\". Hughes also said that \"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American.\" Several U.S. politicians agree with Hughes. EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager has stated that splitting Facebook should only be done as \"a remedy of the very last resort\", and that splitting Facebook would not solve Facebook's underlying problems.\n\n\n=== Customer support ===\nFacebook has been criticized for its lack of human customer support. When users personal and business accounts are breached, many are forced to go through small claims court to regain access and restitution.\n\n\n=== Litigation ===\n\nThe company has been subject to repeated litigation. Its most prominent case addressed allegations that Zuckerberg broke an oral contract with Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra to build the then-named \"HarvardConnection\" social network in 2004.\nOn March 6, 2018, BlackBerry sued Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp subdivision for ripping off key features of its messaging app. In October 2018, a Texan woman sued Facebook, claiming she had been recruited into the sex trade at the age of 15 by a man who \"friended\" her on the social media network. Facebook responded that it works both internally and externally to ban sex traffickers.\nIn 2019, British solicitors representing a bullied Syrian schoolboy, sued Facebook over false claims. They claimed that Facebook protected prominent figures from scrutiny instead of removing content that violates its rules and that the special treatment was financially driven. The Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of New York state and 47 other state and regional governments filed separate suits against Facebook on December 9, 2020, seeking antitrust action based on its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsUp among other companies, calling these practices as anticompetitive. The suits also assert that in acquiring these products, they weakened their privacy measures for their users. The suits, besides other fines, seek to unwind the acquisitions from Facebook.\nOn January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Facebook a 60 million euros for not allowing its internet users an easy refusal of cookies along with Google. On December 22, 2022, the Quebec Court of Appeal approved a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Facebook users who claim they were discriminated against because the platform allows advertisers to target both job and housing advertisements based on various factors, including age, gender, and even race. The lawsuit centers on the platform's practice of \"micro targeting ads\", claiming ads are ensured to appear only in the feeds of people who belong to certain targeted groups. Women, for example, would not see ads targeting men, while older generation men would not see an ad aimed at people between 18 and 45.\nThe class action could include thousands of Quebec residents who have been using the platform as early as April 2016, who were seeking jobs or housing during that period. Facebook has 60 days after the court's December 22 ruling to decide to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. If it does not appeal, the case returns to the Quebec Superior Court. On September 21, 2023, the California Courts of Appeal ruled that Facebook could be sued for discriminatory advertising under the Unruh Civil Rights Act.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Scope ===\nA commentator in The Washington Post noted that Facebook constitutes a \"massive depository of information that documents both our reactions to events and our evolving customs with a scope and immediacy of which earlier historians could only dream\". Especially for anthropologists, social researchers, and social historians—and subject to proper preservation and curation—the website \"will preserve images of our lives that are vastly crisper and more nuanced than any ancestry record in existence\".\n\n\n=== Economy ===\nEconomists have noted that Facebook offers many non-rivalrous services that benefit as many users as are interested without forcing users to compete with each other. By contrast, most goods are available to a limited number of users. E.g., if one user buys a phone, no other user can buy that phone. Three areas add the most economic impact: platform competition, the market place and user behavior data. Facebook began to reduce its carbon impact after Greenpeace attacked it for its long-term reliance on coal and resulting carbon footprint. In 2021 Facebook announced that their global operations are supported by 100 percent renewable energy and they have reached net zero emissions, a goal set in 2018.\nFacebook provides a development platform for many social gaming, communication, feedback, review, and other applications related to online activities. This platform spawned many businesses and added thousands of jobs to the global economy. Zynga Inc., a leader in social gaming, is an example of such a business. An econometric analysis found that Facebook's app development platform added more than 182,000 jobs in the U.S. economy in 2011. The total economic value of the added employment was about $12 billion ($16.8 billion in 2024 dollars).\n\n\n=== Society ===\n\nFacebook was one of the first large-scale social networks. In The Facebook Effect, David Kirkpatrick said that Facebook's structure makes it difficult to replace, because of its \"network effects\". As of 2016, it was estimated 44% of Americans get news through Facebook. A study published at Frontiers Media in 2023 found that there was more polarization of the user-base on Facebook than even far-right social networks like Gab.\n\n\n=== Mental and emotional health ===\n\nStudies have associated social networks with positive and negative impacts on emotional health.\nStudies have associated Facebook with feelings of envy, often triggered by vacation and holiday photos. Other triggers include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty—such feelings leave people dissatisfied with their own lives. A joint study by two German universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting Facebook, and another study by Utah Valley University found that college students felt worse about themselves following an increase in time on Facebook.\nPositive effects include signs of \"virtual empathy\" with online friends and helping introverted persons learn social skills. A 2020 experimental study in the American Economic Review found that deactivating Facebook led to increased subjective well-being. In a blog post in December 2017, the company highlighted research that has shown \"passively consuming\" the News Feed, as in reading but not interacting, left users with negative feelings, whereas interacting with messages pointed to improvements in well-being.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nIn February 2008, a Facebook group called \"One Million Voices Against FARC\" organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of Colombians marched in protest against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). In August 2010, one of North Korea's official government websites and the country's official news agency, Uriminzokkiri, joined Facebook.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring many journalists claimed Facebook played a major role in the 2011 Egyptian revolution. On January 14, the Facebook page of \"We are all Khaled Said\" was started by Wael Ghoniem to invite the Egyptian people to \"peaceful demonstrations\" on January 25. In Tunisia and Egypt, Facebook became the primary tool for connecting protesters and led the Egyptian government to ban it, Twitter and other sites. After 18 days, the uprising forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign.\nIn a Bahraini uprising that started on February 14, 2011, Facebook was utilized by the Bahraini regime and regime loyalists to identify, capture and prosecute citizens involved in the protests. A 20-year-old woman named Ayat Al Qurmezi was identified as a protester using Facebook and imprisoned. In 2011, Facebook filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to form a political action committee under the name FB PAC. In an email to The Hill, a spokesman for Facebook said \"Facebook Political Action Committee will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.\"\nDuring the Syrian civil war, the YPG, a libertarian army for Rojava recruited westerners through Facebook in its fight against ISIL. Dozens joined its ranks. The Facebook page's name \"The Lions of Rojava\" comes from a Kurdish saying which translates as \"A lion is a lion, whether it's a female or a male\", reflecting the organization's feminist ideology.\nIn recent years, Facebook's News Feed algorithms have been identified as a cause of political polarization, for which it has been criticized. It has likewise been accused of amplifying the reach of 'fake news' and extreme viewpoints, as when it may have enabled conditions which led to the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis. Facebook first played a role in the American political process in January 2008, shortly before the New Hampshire primary. Facebook teamed up with ABC and Saint Anselm College to allow users to give live feedback about the \"back to back\" January 5 Republican and Democratic debates. Facebook users took part in debate groups on specific topics, voter registration and message questions.\nOver a million people installed the Facebook application \"US Politics on Facebook\" in order to take part which measured responses to specific comments made by the debating candidates. A poll by CBS News, UWIRE and The Chronicle of Higher Education claimed to illustrate how the \"Facebook effect\" had affected youthful voters, increasing voting rates, support of political candidates, and general involvement. The new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, connected hundreds of millions of people. By 2008, politicians and interest groups were experimenting with systematic use of social media to spread their message. By the 2016 election, political advertising to specific groups had become normalized. Facebook offered the most sophisticated targeting and analytics platform. ProPublica noted that their system enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of \"Jew hater\", \"How to burn Jews\", or, \"History of 'why Jews ruin the world\".\nFacebook has used several initiatives to encourage its users to register to vote and vote. An experiment in 2012 involved showing Facebook users pictures of their friends who reported that they had voted; users who were shown the pictures were about 2% more likely to report that they had also voted compared to the control group, which was not encouraged to vote. In 2020, Facebook announced the goal of helping four million voters register in the US, saying that it had registered 2.5 million by September.\nThe Cambridge Analytica data scandal offered another example of the perceived attempt to influence elections. The Guardian claimed that Facebook knew about the security breach for two years, but did nothing to stop it until it became public. Facebook banned political ads to prevent the manipulation of voters in the US's November's election. Propaganda experts said there are other ways for misinformation to reach voters on social media platforms and blocking political ads will not serve as a proven solution.\nIn March 2024, former US President Donald Trump said that getting rid of TikTok would allow Facebook, which he called the \"enemy of the people\", to double its business. He spoke after President Biden said he was ready to sign legislation that would require TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the video platform or face a ban in the US.\n\n\n==== India ====\nAhead of the 2019 general elections in India, Facebook has removed 103 pages, groups and accounts on Facebook and Instagram platforms originating from Pakistan. Facebook said its investigation found a Pakistani military link, along with a mix of real accounts of ISPR employees, and a network of fake accounts created by them that have been operating military fan pages, general interest pages but were posting content about Indian politics while trying to conceal their identity. Owing to the same reasons, Facebook also removed 687 pages and accounts of Congress because of coordinated inauthentic behavior on the platform.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nFacebook and Zuckerberg have been the subject of music, books, film and television. The 2010 film The Social Network, directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin, stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg and went on to win three Academy Awards and four Golden Globes.\nIn 2008, Collins English Dictionary declared \"Facebook\" as its new Word of the Year. In December 2009, the New Oxford American Dictionary declared its word of the year to be the verb \"unfriend\", defined as \"To remove someone as a 'friend' on a social networking site such as Facebook\".\n\n\n=== Internet.org ===\n\nIn August 2013, Facebook founded Internet.org in collaboration with six other technology companies to plan and help build affordable Internet access for underdeveloped and developing countries. The service, called Free Basics, includes various low-bandwidth applications such as AccuWeather, BabyCenter, BBC News, ESPN, and Bing. There was severe opposition to Internet.org in India, where the service started in partnership with Reliance Communications in 2015 was banned a year later by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). In 2018, Zuckerberg claimed that \"Internet.org efforts have helped almost 100 million people get access to the internet who may not have had it otherwise.\"\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nFacebook announced in 2021 that it will make an effort to stop disinformation about climate change. The company will use George Mason University, Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the University of Cambridge as sources of information. The company will expand its information hub on climate to 16 countries. Users in other countries will be directed to the site of the United Nations Environment Programme for information.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSue Halpern, \"For the Love of Money\" (review of Sarah Wynn-Williams, Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, Flatiron, 382 pp.), The New York Review of Books, vol.

        "content": "The 2025–26 UEFA Conference League is the fifth season of the UEFA Conference League, Europe's tertiary club football tournament organised by UEFA.\nThis is the second UEFA Conference League played under a new format involving a 36-team league phase. The new format also does not allow teams to transfer from the Europa League to the Conference League from the league phase onwards, and thus the Conference League titleholders (Chelsea) are unable to defend their title as the winner of the Conference League automatically qualifies for the Europa League league phase. However, Chelsea had already qualified for the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League league phase via their domestic league position prior to winning the Conference League, so the automatic berth in the Europa League was not required and the access list was rebalanced.\nThe final will be played at the Red Bull Arena in Leipzig, Germany. The winners of the tournament will automatically qualify for the 2026–27 UEFA Europa League league phase, unless they qualify for the 2026–27 UEFA Champions League or Europa League through their league performance. In which case, the access list will be rebalanced.\n\n\n== Association team allocation ==\nA total of 164 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations are participating in the 2025–26 UEFA Conference League. The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\n\nAssociations 1–12 each have one team.\nAssociations 13–33 and 51–55 (except Russia) each have two teams.\nAssociations 34–50 each have three teams (except Liechtenstein, which has one).\n15 teams eliminated from the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League and 41 teams eliminated from the 2025–26 UEFA Europa League will be transferred to the Conference League.\n\n\n=== Association ranking ===\nFor the 2025–26 UEFA Conference League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2024 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2019–20 to 2023–24.\nApart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Conference League, as noted below:\n\n(UCL) – Additional teams transferred from the UEFA Champions League\n(UEL) – Additional/vacated teams transferred from/to the UEFA Europa League\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nThe following is the access list for this season.\n\nThe information here reflects the ongoing suspension of Russia in European football, and so the following changes to the default access list were made:\n\nThe cup winners of associations 39 to 44 (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Luxembourg and Lithuania) will enter the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round.\nAs a result of corresponding changes to the Champions League access list, there will be one fewer loser from the Champions League first qualifying round transferred to the Conference League second qualifying round (Champions Path) so one transferred team will receive a bye to the third qualifying round (Champions Path).\nAs the Champions League title holders (Paris Saint-Germain) qualified for the Champions League via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list were made:\n\nAs a result of corresponding changes to the Champions League access list, there will be one fewer loser from the Champions League first qualifying round (two fewer in total) transferred to the Conference League second qualifying round (Champions Path), so one transferred team (two in total) will receive a bye to the third qualifying round (Champions Path).\nAs the Conference League title holders (Chelsea) qualified for the Champions League phase via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list were made:\n\nThe cup winners of association 34 (Finland) will enter the Europa League first qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round.\nThe cup winners of associations 45 (Malta) and 46 (Georgia) will enter the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round.\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:\n\nCW: Domestic cup winners\n2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, etc.: League position of the previous season\nLC: League cup winners\nRW: Regular season winners\nPW: End-of-season Conference League play-offs winners\nCL: Transferred from the Champions League\nQ1: Losers from the first qualifying round\nEL: Transferred from the Europa League\nPO: Losers from the play-off round\nCH/MP Q3: Losers from the third qualifying round (Champions/Main Path)\nQ2: Losers from the second qualifying round\nQ1: Losers from the first qualifying round\nThe second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round were divided into Champions Path (CH) and Main Path (MP).\n\nTwo teams not playing in a national top division will take part in the competition: Vaduz (2nd tier) and Spaeri (2nd tier).\nNotes\n\n\n== Round and draw dates ==\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows.

        "title": "Dhadak 2",
        "content": "Dhadak 2 (transl. Heartbeat 2) is a 2025 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film written and directed by Shazia Iqbal and produced by Dharma Productions, Zee Studios and Cloud 9 Pictures. A spiritual sequel to Dhadak (2018) and a remake of the Tamil film Pariyerum Perumal (2018), it stars Siddhant Chaturvedi and  Triptii Dimri in the lead roles.\nDhadak 2 was released theatrically on 1 August 2025 to positive reviews but became a box-office failure.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nNilesh and Vidhi fall in love with each other.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 57% of 14 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.5/10.\nRahul Desai of The Hollywood Reporter India commented that \"Shazia Iqbal’s remake of Pariyerum Perumal is a brave and intuitive entry in the canon of anti-caste storytelling.\"\nSubhash K Jha writing for News 24 gave 4.5 stars out of 5 and writes that \"Dhadak 2 is an experience far beyond the original. This is not a remake. It is an intelligent emotional recreation which irons out the rough edges, makes the original characters sharper and more authentic, adds new ones, imbuing the end product with a vigorous glow.\" Divya Nair of Rediff.com awarded 4 stars out of 5 and noted that \"After a long time, here's a film that does justice to the people whose stories are never heard or written about.\" Writing for The Hindu, Anuj Kumar called the film a mixed bag mentioning,\"In Dhadak 2, a remake of the Tamil film Pariyerum Perumal, where caste becomes the villain in a young romance, debutant director Shazia Iqbal struggles to strike a balance between retaining the voice of the original and applying a Dharma polish to a social reality that has been mainly out of the syllabus for Bollywood biggies.\"\nShachi Chaturvedi of News 18 rated it 3.5/5 stars and commented that \"It is a compelling romantic thriller tackling caste issues in modern India. Don't miss it.\nCritic of Bollywood Hungama gave it 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that Dhadak 2 makes an important comment on the caste system and works due to the subject, performances, hard-hitting scenes and powerful climax.\" Nandini Ramnath writing for Scroll.in observed that \"The Hindi adaptation would have done well to dispense with the overreach of some of its source material. While Dhadak 2 starkly reveals the manner in which casteism undermines the body, intellect and soul, the 146-minute movie piles on the misery for Neelesh, particularly in the heavy-going sections leading up to the climax.\"\nSana Farzeen of India Today rated 3/5 stars and said that  Dhadak 2 has its heart in the right place and boasts compelling performances, but it stops short of becoming the powerful, unapologetic film it had the potential to be.\"\nRishabh Suri of Hindustan Times rated 2.5/5 stars writes in his review that \"Dhadak 2 is a film that carries a powerful message but fumbles with its storytelling. It wants to speak about caste, oppression, and systemic injustice- and when it does, it hits the right notes. But it's weighed down by an uneven narrative and an overstretched runtime. This could have been a hard-hitting social drama. Instead, it settles for moments of brilliance buried under a ton of missed opportunities.\"\nRadhika Sharma of NDTV gave 3 stars out of 5 and said that \"The Shazia Iqbal film calls a spade a spade, but the ending feels too good to be true.\"\nVinamra Mathur of Firstpost gave 3 stars out of 5 and observed that \"Dhadak 2 may not change the scheme of things despite shedding light on the dark side of the nation. It also at times bites more than it can chew, with the screenplay juxtaposing horror and humour together.\"\nDevesh Sharma of Filmfare rated it 4/5 stars and said that \"This film isn't for the faint-hearted. It will make you uncomfortable, and that’s exactly the point. Because it should. As a society, we’ve learned to take caste discrimination in stride. We treat it like something that exists only in headlines, not in real life. Even when it happens right in front of us, we often choose to look away.\" Writing for Mint, Uday Bhatia mentioned,\"Shazia Iqbal’s Dhadak 2, a Hindi remake of Pariyerum Perumal, takes a great deal from Mari Selvaraj’s superb 2018 Tamil film. I don’t remember this scene, though. It's a throwaway joke, but a telling one. Unlike most Hindi films about caste, which either tiptoe around the issue or are boringly instructional, Dhadak 2 can imagine how people who’ve seen oppression their whole lives might turn it into gallows humour.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and said that \"This is a film which is clearly on the right side of many of the hot button issues we need to be pressing: casteism, classism, feminism, gender identities. While at it, you can see an awareness of the wrongs and injustices which have made, and continue to make headlines.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDhadak 2 at IMDb\nDhadak 2 at Bollywood Hungama",

        "content": "Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita, are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\nThe rankings of national economies have changed significantly over time. For instance, the United States overtook the British Empire around 1916; Japan rose rapidly in the post-World War II period to become the world’s second-largest economy by the 1970s; China moved from ninth place in 1978 to second in 2010 following market reforms; and more recently India has climbed into the top five. These shifts reflect long-term changes in global economic output.\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank's data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF's definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\n\n\n== Table ==\nThe table initially ranks each IMF member including  sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited recognition \nThe links in the \"Country/Territory\" row of the following table link to the article on the GDP or the economy of the respective country or territory.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of countries by GDP (PPP)\nPer capita:\n\nList of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita\nList of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita\nGrowth:\n\nList of countries by real GDP growth rate\nList of countries by real GDP per capita growth\nPast and projected:\n\nList of countries by past and projected GDP (nominal)\nList of countries by past and projected GDP (PPP)\nTrillion dollar club (macroeconomics)\nBy region:\n\nList of African countries by GDP (nominal)\nList of Arab League countries by GDP (nominal)\nList of countries in Asia-Pacific by GDP (nominal)\nList of Commonwealth of Nations countries by GDP (nominal)\nList of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal)\nList of North American countries by GDP (nominal)\nList of Oceanian countries by GDP\nList of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)\nOther entities:\n\nList of cities by GDP\nList of continents by GDP\nList of first-level administrative divisions by GRDP\nList of regions by past GDP (PPP)\nTrade bloc § Statistics\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",
